===================== EXP NOTES =====================
i guess there are 2 measures of virality
1. how viral a particular comment is
2. how viral the entire topic is

-------------- Experiments in progress --------------

---------------- Experiments planned ----------------

===================== TASKS TODO ====================
try using pytorch's instead of huggingface's version of transformers to quantify perf speedup
carefully split up processed data pkl files and label what has been done with each
try blindly running each tree as a linear array
try running with depth up to 2, breath up to 3

implement logic to do single task training on either task

===================== TASKS DONE ====================
install tweet tokenizer
try out tweet tokenizer
compare difference to bert tokenizer
merge coarse_discourse dataset with semeval17
tokenize only first 4 posts
stuck at the loss function. debug where it is going wrong
implement test function
implement check 1 test run
implement the length prediction loss
get the modified version to work
set up msi laptop as server at home
set up things on nus server
implement multi gpu
check f1 scoring bugs
to get the pkl files up on the remote pc, run the DataProcessor main function.
run 1 epoch of full training to time the model
implement model storing on best results
check accuracy measurement
modify hierarchical transformer model using huggingface
implement num workers on dataloading
log the steps in the previous work
write readme doc
try adam optimizer
try weighing the cost function to penalize the negative class
formatted SRQ dataset in the same way
tokenize SRQ dataset
implement a file to run tests on SRQ only, using older models
try weighing length cost function higher
try to split into smaller buckets for length
implement single datapoint test 
eval - printing
try bert large (TOO large to fit into memory. discuss with teammates)
try maxpool avgpool on the text before feeding into nn to quantify perf speedup
convert the data structure to define virality as immediate subtree size (2 levels down, 3 wide)
