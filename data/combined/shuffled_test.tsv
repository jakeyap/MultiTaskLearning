5432	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	19	 So what is a wave in political terms? When a party wins 300 plus seats in an elections. There was a wave in the country when Rajiv Gandhi won 415 seats in 1984. There was a wave when Indira won 350 odd seats in 1980.  The Congress in 2009 won 200 odd seat. So was there a Gandhi/Manmohan wave?   Unfortunately the Modi's PR team has infiltrated the media, who have perpetuated this ridiculous myth of a "Modi wave." So now in every interview, every discussion, even a simple question to a person on the street a mention of Modi wave is mandatory. The BJP might win 200 odd seats, but there is certainly no Modi wave. Let's not fool ourselves. ||||| No trace of Modi wave in country, says Arvind Kejriwal: [URL]  Kejriwal admits there is a Modi wave in country: [URL]  ||||| Eh, you have got it wrong. Not an insult or sarcasm or anything, but you have completely misunderstood the term "Modi Wave".   Modi Wave, the way most of the nation perceives it, is Modi's general popularity. Usually when elections are contested, politicians go to various constituencies and campaign to the voters. People who don't know that politician will get to know his/hers political ideologies, promises, or in general, they will tell you on what fields they are representing you in the government (which is the basis of democracy).   In Modi Wave, as it happened in previous Gujarat elections, Modi went to most of the constituencies and campaigned. Millions of uninitiated citizens on BJP or Modi were motivated to vote for Modi and started talking more about him than before. This ripple effect of hype is called Modi Wave.   You have confused Modi Wave with Wave Election.     **Tl;Dr:** Geologist_III's comment...  ||||| You can see the wave if you also compare voter turnout with 2009, which can be a measure of how optimistic people are about elections. As a resident of rajasthan, I can tell the difference in enthusiasm of people, even though one party will sweep the state yet again.  Also, unlike congress, BJP does not exist in every state. So 200 are enough for a theoretical maximum of 300. ||||| It is the OP that has been fooling herself for the past 6 months. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari ask people on the streets and chances are you'll find people who support Modi just about everywhere. While it may not translate into votes in many places, you cannot deny he has grabbed the public imagination.  If there was no Modi wave would intellectuals, journalists, rival politicians etc. spend so much time trying to criticise it? Would foreign media, NRI leftists, Bollywood and even Sonia herself be so desperate as to publicly appeal voters not to vote Modi?  The more time and effort you spend denying it, the more you confirm its existence. ||||| BJP - Modi = 100 seats  BJP + Modi = 180 seats  => Modi wave ||||| If Modi is good enough for Raj Thackeray, he's good enough for me. ||||| From what some ground reports are saying NDA **might** cross 300. In fact some statisticians who are predicting the elections say that they had to reduce the BJP numbers to give results  And here is also another fun fact. A rising trend in opinion polls always results in a large victory margin. Same happened for Indira and Rajeev ||||| While it's useless to try and explain stuff to people like Mataji here, a Modi wave is being talked about so much because of the fact that the BJP wouldn't have been nearly as popular (and you know that as well) were it not for Modi. ||||| flawless logic!   ^^^^^yes, ^^^^^i'm ^^^^^being ^^^^^sarcastic ||||| k.  Its called a wave because in many of the constituencies those who vote for Modi didnt even look at the name of the BJP candidate. They just voted for 'Modi'. *Par Naam hi kaafi hai*. ^^^ignore ^^^my ^^^amateur ^^^hindi ||||| A wave is when there is an overwhelming desire for change which of course manifests with an absolute majority for the change agent. If BJP does not get an outright majority, then one might say it was anti-incumbency, scandals and so on but it is not a modi wave. If BJP (or NDA as it is today) gets 272+ one can say it is Modi wave. Whether it is a myth or not, have to wait till 16/05 ||||| Also its a Modi wave and not anti-Congress or anti-incumbent wave cuz people are choosing Modi and not *other* available options on the ballot. Simple "burnol" explanation. :) ||||| Can confirm in Kolkata, there is no such thing here.  If you ask somebody, Bhere is da Modi Babe, at best they'll look bewildered and look at you suspiciously thinking you are some sort of a eve-teaser or anti social element.

1233	1,3,3	5	This question is mainly the result of this incident that happened [6 days ago]([URL]  Say in July 2015, a Russian Mig-31 is being intercepted by a NATO F-16, over the Baltic Sea after the Mig-31 is found flying in restricted airspace. Suddenly, a miscalculation is made at the controls, and the two jets collide, tragically killing both pilots.  What happens next? What is the international reaction, specifically between NATO and Russia over this freak accident caused by heightened military patrols between the two nations? ||||| During the Cold War an incident like that may have been enough to start a small conflict but nothing larger.  Now, in an age that prefers diplomacy rather than conflict I think Russia and NATO may call it even seeing as both sides lost one pilot.  That being said, the NATO state that sent the pilot up may want a more severe response because there was no need for their airman to die while intercepting a trespassing aircraft from a nation that knew it didn't belong there. ||||| It certainly wouldn't lead to war, but it likely would lead to near-unanimous criticisms of Russia's actions.  What it could do however is cause Russia to either escalate or de-escalate the situation, I find it hard to say which. 
9006	1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,1	40	So yesterday I joined a game, and I joined my teams TS. I then went afk to grab a snack, and when I came back I was banned when the game wasn't supposed to start until 5 minutes. I think hosts should have to have a full ratio vote before early starting  **TD;LR** Don't ban someone for being afk if you're early starting. ||||| what snack did you get? ||||| You never see a sports game starting early because people want to go on line and get food. It would be unfair if out of the blue the game started and you missed a cool play.  If you say the game starts at 2 PM, you start it at 2 PM. Don't be a cunt host.  ||||| Well the game should start when it says it will, the thing which gets me is when hosts do votes and 20 people out of 30 says yes and nobody says no and they don't seem to figure some of those 10 will be afk ||||| I join a game according to the post. If I need to finish homework or do a couple dishes before a game, I like to be able to do that if a game is supposed to start 15 minutes after opening. ||||| some hosts will open an FFA 15 minutes before and then start 1 minute after opening. If you open like 5 (or 1 if you're milen) minutes prior, I guess if you early start by like 1 or 2 minutes that's okay because people probably won't be afk then, but don't start more than 3 minutes before the actual starting time.   Another thing, when hosts do votes for early start, afk people can't vote. ||||| Early starts should never happen unless the match post says they can. ||||| I think the bigger issue here is banning for being AFK, that's just strange. Maybe kick someone if it's 30+ minutes but...  As for early starts, I'm fine with them. I do think it's a bit silly when they do a vote because the people who don't want it are AFK. ||||| I never early start for this reason. ||||| Early starts are stupid, because whenever I see a game that is about to be open at :00 and it's 2 mins till and doesn't start till :15, I'm going to wait to join then go get my snack. I also shower during pregame because I don't have enough time before the whitelist goes off. ||||| I never start early because of this. I just hate when people spam me to start early..… ||||| Early starts are dumb. There's a start time for a reason. Stop being impatient / giving into impatient players. ||||| Yeah i mean I get my popcorn and I'm like "time to play!" and then everyones full diamond already man ||||| Look, If you know you're gonna be AFK, mainly in a random teams game, tell the host, I never early start if someone has told me that they're gonna be AFK.  But I don't think that Early starting is bad. ||||| Yea I hate early start. At least do a vote where you only start if 100% of the people vote yes ||||| Name and shame. ||||| Whenever I go afk pregame, I always tell the host and tell my teammates to dig me in when it starts.  ||||| I early started today.  I didn't ban anyone tho 0.0 ||||| Why would you get banned in the first place for being afk? If it was only a few minutes... ||||| I think it is circumstantial  ||||| I completely agree. Votes on an early start is stupid because the people that are afk and don't want an early start aren't there to vote.

So what type of items (besides pot and pipes) would the community be interested in?   ||||| Been thinking about getting a nice zippo ||||| To be honest, with the current price of Potcoin being what it is and me being the dreamer i am. I cannot stand to part with any of them. The amount of coins required to get anything that i would want and don't have is just too much for me. There is a lot that comes in to play.

5286	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3	21	I am curious as to what people think is wrong with this ultimate that it sees such little popularity in hotslogs (3.3%)  I have been using it exclusively for the last 50 or so Greymane games and actually prefer it over Go for the throat as it has much more utility. I think the only downside is that a missed shot is a wasted ultimate.  Also jumping across half the screen is pretty funny.  Edit: what improvements would you want to the skill? ||||| It's a very bad ult. The only advantage it has right now is that nobody even know it exists so you can surprise the enemy team with it. ||||| "the only downside is that a missed shot is a wasted ultimate."  thats all you have to say to this ult. Who you wanna hit with you ult? The tank? mostly not killable... In the most cases you wont hit the hero you want to hit.  Such the worst talent in the Nexus right now.  ||||| Its just an unreliable Tyrande trait ||||| It's a blockable and missable skillshot on a 60 second cooldown, which provides Vulnerable and pitiful damage. It's just bad, that's why no one picks it. ||||| It's not a bad ult per se, but it's kinda risky to hit and hard to exploit, whilst GFTT does the same thing, is easier, more reliable, etc. ||||| Wait, greymane has another ult? :-) ||||| Because Greymane's role in a teamfight is to poke until someone can be bursted down using his CDs. You're foregoing a high burst finisher  (that can be used twice) to gain a little more poke. The vulnerability isn't going to make up for the difference in damage between the two ults. ||||| It's because you can never follow through. As soon as a hero is hit with it the other team knows where you are planning on jumping. This allows easy denial of the kill ending with your death ||||| It offers the same thing GFTT does, just riskier.  Both heroics provide a long range dash with some burst.  the 3 attacks from GFTT deal about as much damage as the bonus from MFTK will if your whole team doesn't focus them down, in which case that person was probably fucked anyway. However, GFTT is targeted and the damage is guaranteed, while MFTK can miss, get blocked, or you could get screwed by the enemy having an attack speed debuff (See: Xul) and be put on exactly the same cooldown.   As well, GFTT lets you chain it from the second your pick it up at 10, while MFTK has to wait until level 20 to actually become better. Even then, the piercing MFTK doesn't let you choose who you leap at, so you can't dive the squishy backline if you had to shoot through a tanky frontline first.  The two abilities are just too similar, but GFTT is just way more reliable. ||||| It's useful if you're playing 'hard mode'.    I've likened it to the Pokemon Nuzlocke challenge if anyone remembers what that is.   But seriously, it's truly horrible.  No reason it shouldn't be targetable. ||||| After the cocktail nerf I played around with it a bit.  After a few game I could reliably hit Li Ming or a back line Morales and bring havoc for a few seconds.  It needs a little bit more kick though.  After the first time or two you dive in with it the teams learns to quickly target you and there is usually no way out.  ||||| It may be because it requires too much skill to use for most people. I was playing Jaina in a game recently and I couldn't for the life of me understand how Graymane was able to jump almost an entire screen at me and kill me in almost every encounter. I thought he had been reworked or something until I noticed he was using "that other" ultimate. That was actually the first time I read the description of that ultimate as well. :p  To me it seems like a very viable pick. The ability to jump further than any other melee hero to close the distance seems really powerful to me. Graymane owned me that game at least.
2668	1,3,3	14	So, I'm a fairly recently diagnosed Aspie at the age of 32. This diagnosis occurred about 4 months into me returning to full-time education. I was extremely anxious about going back into this environment after many years away. The main reason for this anxiety was the social interaction part. I have huge difficulties with understanding others and all of the other usual things.   I had a group of about 7 friends initially at college, this got whittled down to 3 after a few months due to natural deviations in this social group. I had some authorised time off from college before the Christmas break due to illness and other things going on in my life. It was around this time that I noticed the group conversation on whatsapp fall silent (we communicated pretty much daily via this method). One of the girls communicated with me on a one-to-one basis a few times over this break, but that was it.   I return to college at the beginning of this month to being excluded from this group. I was ignored, they look straight at me and say nothing. I try and smile at one of them and they just look straight away, they sit at other tables from me and all of that other horrible 'high school' treatment.   I know for a fact that they have set up another group conversation without me as I overheard something from them.   They know about my new diagnosis and the difficulties I'd been encountering before I went off before Christmas. I've also made various posts on my Facebook about my diagnosis. I've been very open with it. They are all friends with me on there so they are well aware. It's around this time that they fall silent on me and start ignoring me.   I did message one of the girls a few days ago about my concerns and asking her; 'why is this happening, what have I done'. She replied with a very abrasive blunt message saying 'I don't know why you feel like this, speak to the girls' - impossible for me and she ignored all of the things I wrote to her explaining why I had been quiet and what I had been dealing with. There was no understanding nor compassion.   I know I shouldn't care about people like this, but it's all making it impossible for me to feel comfortable at college. I feel like I've done something horrific to one of them and I have done nothing at all. Yes I was quite quiet over the break but that was due to a massive lull in my mood and I wasn't really speaking to anyone.  I go in there every day and feel like a freak and a loser. I certainly didn't expect to be experiencing this at the age of 32. The last time I went through anything similar was when I was 14.   I really want to give up on making new friends if this is going to keep happening. People don't understand nor do they want to tolerate someone with issues like mine I suppose.   I really wish I didn't care about this, but I can't help it, I can't move on. I feel like this is some weird form of bullying and control by them. They come across all nice and friendly but I've seen the vicious side of them now.   What hurts the most is that one of the girls (who is 30) has a brother on the spectrum to the extent that he needs specialist schooling (there is a huge age gap). I thought she would be the mature one who would understand me the most, but she's more interested in the 'ringleader' so to speak.   I expected better for humanity. I was wrong to. I only really have a couple of real friends and they are understanding of my issues.   I think people like me to begin with but as time goes on that subsides when they find out I'm not this happy all the time party animal that is into make up and fashion (which they all are at college). It seems that I'm ok at ***making*** friends, but ***keeping*** them is a different story.   What should I do about these college incidents? I feel like I can't continue in this environment, it's destroying me. I'm quite weak mentally I think.   I want to halt social interaction with anyone outside of my close circle of people now. Every time I try and get on in life socially I am hit with ignorance and let down. I was agoraphobic for years and I'm terrified of it heading back that way again because of things like this.   Has anyone else also experienced similar issues when people find out about your ASD?   **TL;DR - Made some friends on returning to education. A few months later they are excluding me for some unknown reason. Tried to speak to one of them to get an answer, was hit with an abrasive message in return.**  ||||| Your frenemies sound like bitches. Maybe their leader is bipolar and going through a depressive phase that's randomly aimed itself at you. Or maybe this group has simply lost its use for you. Whatever. You're right to move on from them.   But where to move on to? I'd highly recommend reading [this book]([URL] about how to make and keep friends as an adult. It's been immensely helpful to me in preventing loneliness. See if your library has it!  ||||| It sounds to me you got very caught up in your own diagnosis and issues, and your *new* friends did not have the emotional investment to tolerate this self-discovery. And were likewise unreceptive to your later attempts to clarify, finding them annoying. 
908	1,3,3,3,3	15	Hi all, we have a new office space we're renovating. It used to be a flooring showroom so there were multiple types of flooring.   We've gotten all of the tile grout and mortars off mostly, but there are two patches where wood was glued directly to the concrete. We can't determine the type of glue but it's still very sticky/tacky.   My question is: we're planning on using epoxy paint to paint the concrete floor. Can we paint over this tacky adhesive or does anyone have any suggestions for getting it off?  Thanks in advance! ||||| So i hope this helps, but about 18 months ago my wife and I bought a house. On this covered patio out back there was this awful carpet. I tore it up and there was horrible stubborn adhesive. After trying scrapers and chemical strippers to get it off all I ended up with was blisters, lost money, lost time, aggravation. It was just horrible. Eventually I broke down and rented this machine from Home Depot for about $120 bucks. Its basically a floor sander with this special blade attachment. Lots of mini razor-looking things that are covered in some kind of sand paper. Its also tough work, but it got the glue off the best.   After about 4 hours with this thing (i had about 300 sq feet) the blades started to fail and the machine was running unevenly so i stopped. There were some patches with glue on it still. I used concrete stain and decided to go over the glue with the stain and seal and it looks ok. Kind of looks like a natural rock, random thing.    ||||| $75 electric angle grinder and $2 abrasive concrete/masonry wheel would be my solution. ||||| Yes, we did this at my house, but it took multiple coats and it does show that there is something under there. ||||| Had a similar project at work a few months ago. It took me about 8 hours to remove a hodgepodge of epoxy, paint, adhesive, and who knows what else from a neglected concrete floor.   Rented an industrial floor buffer (I think it was a 19" or 21" model) and bought 4 of the most abrasive/aggressive pads the place had (room is roughly 50'x20'). Used a low-odor tile/floor stripper mixed with water, and applied it everywhere with a mop. Let it sit for a fair amount of time, I want to say 30 minutes (bottle called for 10), then flooded an area of the room and really got to work. With the standing water and stripper mixture on the concrete, it made the floor buffer a lot easier to use, and it seemed to be much more affective since the hodgepodge wasn't heating up and getting sticky again. For the thicker spots, a 4" wide metal ice scraper/chisel was used to scrape it away, then hit those spots with the buffer. It was a pretty slow process, but the buffer made it much easier than purely doing it by hand. Used both sides of all 4 pads.   If you don't have the muscle endurance / strength - it will be a very hard project. The buffer isn't easy for me to hold onto for several hours at a time, and I lift weights religiously.  Without removing the adhesive, you WILL notice it in the epoxy/paint. It's a lot of work, but it definitely pays off.
7856	1,3,0,2,2,3,0,1	13	Just found a little conspiracy tidbit while watching the recent Indie horror game Allison Road. I noticed that...   If you took the title "Allison Road" and the words "Sin Death" that appear in blood on the bathroom wall in Allison Road, you can take the letters in those two words, combine them, and spell... "Silent Hills" the recently cancelled installment in the popular Silent Hill series.  Also, as a bit of fun, there are 11 letters in "Allison Road," one letter for each installment of the Silent Hill series if you include the HD collection (Source: [URL]  So there you have it. Conspiracy theory? Perhaps. I hope so. Make of it what you will ||||| Of course the whole thing is an elaborate hoax by Kojima. ||||| But... There are 2 L's in Allison Road and 3 in Silent Hills. ||||| Are you sure it's not just fun easter egg references? ||||| Isn't Allison Road a fanmade/indie game based on PT? It would clearly have Silent Hills references ||||| On Allison Roads' youtube channel, the creator has said that it is P.T.'s spiritual successor. But the story line and etc are vastly different. The demo up is only the first look and that only gives us the tip of the iceberg in what the game will actually be like as a finished product. ||||| Mmmm nope. I recall them saying that it's heavily inspired by P.T and it's kinda "filling" it's place since P.T was cancelled.

A Guitar Center salesmen came to my house to let me try different studio monitors or something like that. My bedroom was different in the dream from how it actually looks. It was also really late at night when this happened. I became lucid after this because I realized it that things were weird. I had the same thing were the corners went dark and and I had to try really hard to focus. I started running really fast down my street and decided I actually wanted to go to Guitar Center, so I jumped off the side of the street. There's really no guitar center there, but there was in the dream. I ended up in a different part of my town in front of Guitar Center, which really doesn't exist in that place.

9180	1,3,3,3	10	I was approached by a potential client, to rebuild their website, to be hosted on their own IIS6 server.  Initially, the project was extremely basic, with the most complex portion being a contact form.  Through the first couple meetings, the project has morphed into something more complex.    The client would now like a form that a) generates a pdf, that is emailed, and b) stores the record in a SQL database.  Of course they will need a backend, to navigate and manage the records, probably offline.  I'm waiting to find out the type of data they will be requesting, but most likely some of it will be sensitive.  An SSL is already in place.  So my question is this.  I am perfectly capable of creating this in a LAMP environment, but IIS is rather foreign, to me.  Can I pretty much go about this the same way as I would in a LAMP environment?  I'm guessing that the answer is "somewhat", and I'm curious as to what the differences will be.  Any assistance with understanding the scope of this, is greatly appreciated! ||||| i dont think you need to necessarily do any of this in .NET. Assuming the P in your stack is PHP, you can easily install PHP and MySQL on IIS ||||| You didn't mention if the client specifically said whether it has to be asp/asp.net instead of php, but IIS can work with PHP5 as well as MySQL. WIMP - Windows, IIS, MySQL, PHP. If the guy doesn't want MySQL then you can use MSSQL too.  I had one project (php-based) in which I had to convert the db class to use ms sql but everything else was coded in PHP but it works fine.  .htaccess becomes web.config but unfortunately urlwriter only works in IIS7 and above  I'd suggest to use WebPlatformInstaller for IIS [URL]  Otherwise yeah, everything else is more or less the same. ||||| there's no mod_rewrite in iis6 - something for a LAMP guy to be aware of - although there are some third party solutions
961	1,3,3,3,3,3	15	So here I was at Christmas dinner with my gf's parents.  I was enjoying myself until the conversation shifted to me.  Gf's mum: so what are your hobbies (guardian)?  My gf plays video games so the parents do try to understand and try to pretend to have an interest in gaming. I tell them the usual things (jogging reading etc..), I purposly avoid the topic of gaming because I'm a 20+ year old and through out my life i have been shamed for it.  Gf's dad: (gf) tells us your into gaming. (silence)  Me:'yea, yeah I game. I don't play much just a bit of Destiny here and there'.  Gf smiles at me mentioning our favourite game.  Gf's dad: Destiny?  And here goes my reason for this post, after he mentioned his confusion for the game, I pretty much go on a rant on the lore of Destiny, the raids, the excitement. About 15 minutes into it i realised they know my real hobby. They seemed overwhelmed and are probably thinking 'god not another low life...(probably not)'   But after dinner, as I was heading to the bathroom getting ready for bed. I walked past my gf's dads office and saw him on Destiny's web page.   What? What is this? Could I have just converted a man to join the guardians in the stars? Is it possible?  One can only hope....  Tl/Dr: I told my gf's parents about Destiny and it's lore. Found my gf's dad looking/researching into Destiny after hours.  Edit: doing this from a mobile formatting this is like trying to jump in darkness 10x ||||| Just a tip, if someone asks about you and your hobbies at a dinner, do not talk about it for 15 minutes whether or not it's gaming.

6177	1,3,3,3,3,3	13	Hey,  I've heard a lot about people using Macbooks to video edit and them being quite good. However whenever I go to even put videos together with music in FCP, it stutters, plays at lower framerates etc. Effects like Twixtor in AE take sometimes up to 10 minutes just to preview a 5 second slow motion clip.

3695	1,3,3,3,3,3	9	I want to get my wife into jewelery making. I guess beading and wire working? I have sort of a list. I'm on a limited budget, so for now, until I'm sure shes will actually be into it, I want to not by the stuff I don't need. I know she wants to make necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. Here is my list, if someone with experience could add/remove stuff I need or don't, I would greatly appreciate it.  Round-nose pliers  flush cutters  Crimp tool  needle nose pliers  tweezers  flat nose pliers  Beads of a few different sizes and colors.  Ear Hooks, Head Pins and Jump Rings.  Tiger Tail Wire and Parrot Clasps.  Charms and Bead Caps  Beading Needles  Beaded Jewelry Glue  beadalon 19 string and 49  toggle claps, lobster claws  crimp beads, wire guardians.  chains  Thanks, A clueless man.  ||||| Here's a suggestion... keeping in mind that you are on a limited budget, instead of leaving it open-ended you could start her out by putting together a kit to make a specific item - or a matching set, like a beaded bracelet and dangle earrings.   I'd also recommend starting out with plated or base metal findings, rather than sterling silver to start out. Get some pre-made round and oval jump rings, a few pair of ear hooks and some head pins and eye pins, and she can learn to make her own findings from wire later on. Make her first couple of experiences fun and easy, so she can feel some satisfaction and not get too overwhelmed or discouraged early on.  Jump rings are used as connectors between other elements, and can also be used as chain links to make a basic chain. Eye pins are short segments of wire with a loop in one end. You can thread a largish bead onto an eye pin and then twist the free end of wire into a loop so you end up with a bead with a loop at either end. Then add jump rings to connect it to other beads that have been similarly prepared and a clasp to build a bracelet or necklace.  Those operations would only require a pair of round-nose (chain) pliers and a pair of smooth-jawed needle nose or flat nose pliers, and maybe a pair of wire cutters if the eye pins and head pins are longer than she needs. Having two pairs of either needle nose pliers or flat nose pliers will make it easier to grasp and close jump rings. I use two pair of needle nose pliers because they make it easier to get into tight places.  On the other hand you might want to start her out with stringing beads on cord. It looks like you've done all of the research into tools and findings, and the operation is fairly straightforward - but can be a lot of fun. Try to learn her taste in beads - shapes, sizes, materials, colors, etc. You'll be lucky if you have a well-stocked bead shop in your area, otherwise you can find stuff to start out at most craft shops. I buy from an online outfit called [ArtBeads.com]([URL] They have a decent selection and free shipping in the US, and $1.99 shipping to Canada.  There are tons of tutorials and videos online. Once she has mastered the basics she could move on to [wire wrapping]([URL] which is a technique to make rings, pendants and bracelets and settings for stones out of (usually) square wire. Intermediate to advanced students would do well to learn to silver solder connections using a torch, but that's for later.  Seriously though, if you're on a limited budget then start small and let her enjoy a few simple successes while learning the basics. If you have any specific questions please ask and I'll try to help.  Good luck to you both. ||||| Get her an instructional book or two, or maybe a subscription to a beading magazine, for instructions/inspiration.  Good luck. Beading is often the gateway drug into the slightly more expensive hobby of metalworking :) ||||| A place to work is great.   Perhaps you could give her a certificate for the creation of a work space? If you will do the work that is.   Some storage would be good too. ||||| I make jewelry and to be quite honest this is an expensive hobby. The best place to go is Etsy.com to buy materials or perhaps looking for coupons for Michaels in the paper or via email. For starters I suggest buying a kit for jewelry making. If you have a Wal-Mart near you that works great too. You can also look into Firemountaingems.com since they sell at wholesale prices if you buy multiple items (don't have to be the same items either). I would suggest fishing line, chains, beads, charms, beading glue, wire (non-tarnish is best) earring hooks/clasps/etc (depending on what she would like to make). As for tools I think the most important are: flush cutters, needle nose pliers and bent nose pliers. You can also check craigslist and ebay for discounted bulk items. Good luck! ||||| You are on the right track. I would suggest adding a [vice]([URL] a set of small files and a maybe a [soldering kit]([URL] 
133	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3	31	I'm sick of having verizon and being stuck on their update schedule. I don't want to have to root my device and install custom roms. I have a Droid 2 Global so there aren't many rom options anyway...  What have you guys done to get away from cellphone contracts? What are my best options? I live in NYC and I'm planning on buying the Galaxy Nexus, I just want to know what are the best no contract plans? ||||| Straight Talk which allows you to choose if you want to use AT&T or T-Mobile networks as the Galaxy Nexus GSM can be used on either. Or you can look at [this list]([URL] and work it out ||||| I've been off contract for over two years.  I just buy the phone outright (ie not subsidized) and pay month to month.  ||||| If you live in NYC and want a Galaxy Nexus. T-Mobile is your best option. They have a mostly awesome network in that entire area, and pricing is cheap.  For $60-70 dollars a month, you can get unlimited calls, unlimited texts, and 2 to 5 gb of speedy HSPA+ data.  If you don't talk much, they also have a $30 plan with 100 minutes, unlimited texts, and 5gb data.  The nicest thing about T-Mobile is data speed. In NYC, you'll have speeds anywhere from 2 to 200 times faster than a typical 3G Sprint / Boost Mobile / Virgin Mobile user. (not an exaggeration) ||||| T-Mobile $30 / month. Very limited minutes and one of the worst networks in terms of coverage, but if you want to save money, you make your compromises. ||||| If you want no contract, the best way to go would be Virgin Mobile and getting their HTC Evo V (aka the Evo 3D). I know you want the Nexus, but you would be paying a lot more for it on another carrier.  ||||| There is one very good but also unfortunate thing with Tmobile. I've have them for 4 years.   Their own phones (mytouch and galaxy iii) will do wifi calling. Wherever you have good wifi, you have perfect coverage. I don't care what coverage they have because of this. I actually get little to no signal at my house. But I have wifi, a good connection, so perfect signal.  Unfortunately, I do not believe when you buy a galaxy nexus you can do this. ||||| [URL] ||||| Are you happy with the phone?  Are you happy with Verizon's network?  If so, you can keep the phone and reactivate it with Page Plus.  I've been using PP with old Verizon phones (including 3 different Androids) for years.  If getting updates is your main motivation, I'd wager that moving to a pay as you go is heading in the wrong direction. ||||| I'm on BoostMobile since September with unlimited everything on Sprint 3G, mine started at $50 per month, after price dropped to $45, and will drop again to $40 shortly. They have three Android phones to choose from. I use it constantly and am happy with everything, although Verizon had better coverage for me. ||||| I've been on Cricket for the last 5 years. We recently drove from Colorado through Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho while listening to Pandora almost the entire distance. It was only in the most remote areas that we lost service.  I pay $55 per month for unlimited (up to 1.2Gb - then the speed is throttled) 3g service, unlimited text, and unlimited voice with long distance. ||||| Out of curiosity what is the draw to being off contract in the U.S.? Do the smaller companies that piggy back on the larger networks actually give you a discount for bringing your own hardware? Because none of the major carriers do... ||||| T-Mobile is the best option, in my opinion. They have one of the most reliable data services around, and coverage is pretty satisfactory to me. Their prepaid $30/month unlimited text/web and 100 minutes plan is a killer one...I've been on it for the past two weeks and I love it. The only catch is that you'll need a new number, since the plan is only available for new activations only. ||||| >I have a Droid 2 Global so there aren't many rom options anyway...  Root it (but get used to the nuances with RSDLite and get comfy with it for when your phone won't boot). CM7 for D2G is pretty fantastic, IMHO. Only thing that didn't work for me was unlocking the SIM socket - had to be on stock GB, then unlock and flash CM7.  There's also a few ICS based ROMs, but most of them were pretty buggy I found, but it's been a while. I loved my D2G, which came with me all the way to Australia, then lasted about five months before I leaned on the screen or something and cracked the shit out of it. Australia seriously doesn't have a decent Android slider that's anywhere near the ageing D2G, so I have a GNex, but I seriously miss dat keyboard.  I tried replacing the broken screen with one from a trashed D2 (bad IMEI), and here's a tip: they fit, but they're not compatible. Screen got very hot to the touch and neither phone boots anymore. :(  My wife's still rocking her white D2G, with the stocker GB. I keep offering to put CM7 on there, but she's got so many apps it'd take her a week to set the bastard up again.  TL;DR: Give CM7 a shot on your D2G and get a new lease on life out of it. ||||| Since the nexus is banned now you should just buy my 4 month old nexus from me for 300 dollars.

7390	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	19	Hi, I've been trying to mimic the hollandaise sauce that I've been having on eggs benedict at three different places, but every time I make it it doesn't taste anything like it. I have been following the recipes that I have found 2 egg yolks, squirt of lemon juice, melted butter (about 50 gms, have experimented up to 100gm (which is approx a little less than a stick of butter) I have also tried adding a bit of dijon mustard.  So far all I end up with is a thick sauce that just tastes like I'm eating  melted butter. I've tried salted butter and unsalted butter.  I don't know what else to do?  The sauce I'm looking for is creamy with a hint of tang, but while the butter flavour is there, it is subtle and not over powering like when I make it.  What am I doing wrong?? ||||| You are missing the white wine vinegar reduction and pepper.  This gives the sauce it's tang.  Be advised that hollandaise is only as good as the quality of ingredients as well. ||||| like /u/Aurinian mentioned, use the good shit.  it makes a big difference.  it also sounds like you might not be using enough lemon juice, since you mentioned just a squirt, and a lack of tang (and for the love of all that is holy, get a real lemon and juice it, don't use the bottled stuff).  i'm just guessing here, as i just add lemon juice until i get the flavor i want, but i'd wager i'd use in the neighborhood of a tablespoon for a 2 yolk sauce.  you could also try some other things for tang: tarragon vinegar (you can make your own with almost no effort instead of buying a whole bottle) or dry sherry or white wine vinegar.  a couple drops of worcestershire in addition to lemon juice.    i like to add a pinch of white pepper and a tiny, TINY hint of cayenne pepper as well.   ||||| Give [THIS]([URL] a try.  It's fast and the source is impeccable. ||||| Add dill for flavor.  I see the fresh lemon is already here so I can only ask if you are using a double boiler and whipping until your arm falls off?  Wait., one squirt of lemon?  I use a tablespoon to 4 egg yolks.  Sounds like you can up the citrus or find an additional acid to coagulate the sauce. ||||| I love when people put balsamic vinegar or mustard in their hollandaise. So tasty. ||||| Also try champagne vinegar instead of white wine vinegar... Its a world of difference  ||||| For me, you've gotta have a few squirts of hot sauce, white pepper, and smoked paprika finish. Also you can't skimp on the fresh lemon juice. ||||| Try and use very good eggs. They're a huge part of what makes the sauce, so they play a big role in the end result ||||| Whisk yolks, add salt and paprika (or cayenne for the more adventurous). White pepper is optional.   Add about half of your melted butter (whole or clarified - if you are using clarified, have some warm water ready to thin it out. The whole butter has milk solids which will help thin out the sauce)   Add lemon juice, tobacco, and Worcestershire sauce (to taste, you can add more later)   Add the rest of the melted butter. If the sauce is to thick, add some warm water (or more of the lemon juice, tobacco and/or Worcestershire sauce if the flavor is still lacking)  ||||| When I have always made it it's best if you use clarified butter verses just butter.  Also like someone else said you need the white wine vinegar reduction with the pepper. The way I was taught to make it when I was in one of my classes at culinary school is the two egg yolks, clarified butter, the vinegar reduction with pepper that is rehydrated with water and strained, lemon juice and a pinch on cayenne pepper.  I am not a big hollandaise fan but this way works everytime.  ||||| The way I've learned to make hollandaise sauce may not be the traditional way, but I find it comes out creamier than any other I've tried in restaurants.  Similar to your recipe, I use a few egg yolks and lemon.   But instead of butter, I melt about half a block of cream cheese.  I add a little water (1 tbs or 2) to thin it out.  Once  the cream cheese is melted/smooth I mix in the egg yolks, lemon juice, and a dash of paprika.  Personally,  I love butter, but I feel like the cream cheese really makes the sauce creamy. I may try it out with both next time.

After you complete it, the case is dismissed (but not expunged). For the meantime, quit smoking! It's a bunch of BS, but you gotta do it or else you'll be even more fucked. Best of luck to you.   Edit: looked through your post history and at your post on r/leaves and saw that you didn't get any legal citations. Lucky bastard haha. Just be polite and face up to punishment they may give you. Not really worth fighting against something that has already happened. ||||| I got caught smoking (on campus) about six years ago and did in fact get suspended for a semester. However, more recently I had a conversation with a higher-up in the office of academic integrity and they told me that I was unlucky because the year after that happened to me they removed the mandatory suspension (doesn't mean you *definitely* won't get suspended, but my guess is you won't) ||||| My roommate got caught on campus. I think he had to do some community service and take a class. He wasn't suspended or anything. ||||| My friend go caught first semester this year. He didnt get suspended or expellled mainly because it was the end of the semester and when he went to the hearing, he was dressed nicely, very polite, and sounded regretful. Just dont be an idiot and you should be fine ||||| a few years ago (2-3) i knew 5 separate students who had been busted for weed.  2 were formally expelled, I didn't keep up with the other 3 because they weren't my actual friends just people i knew of, but i never saw them again.

3729	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	Say you're a fresh grad looking for your first real job. How much does that job, and maybe even it's title, affect the rest of your career. Is it possible to take a job say, using exclusively just Rails or something, and then a few years later you can only really apply to Rails jobs because that's the only 'experience' on your resume. Maybe you want to work with Java, but you have too many years of experience to apply for a 'Junior Java Developer' position, but no years of professional Java experience to apply for a 'Midlevel Java Developer' position.  Is that a thing, or do most companies only care if you have a few years of developer experience, even if it's in a different stack?  I am mainly focusing on Web Development jobs at the moment, Full-Stack JS stuff, because I find that interesting and it seems to have the most growth/lowest barrier of entry right now. But I don't want to limit myself if I want to get into something else later on. ||||| I always list my job title as Software Engineer, or developer. Never as X platform developer.  My first job had me writing Visual C++, C#, and VB6, my second job was Java and C#, my current job is Java and Python.  If you can code in one language you can code in any that shares the paradigm, OO is OO wherever you are. You just need to to learn the tool set.   ||||| I am in the computer networking field. My first job title was listed as vaguely as possible while still having all of the qualifications that I wanted to convey in a small description of the job title. My first job was tier-1 helpdesk, my second job is Network Operation Administrator. I used the qualifications from the first job to prove to the new company that I have experience in the relevant field. ||||| I don't have junior in my title but recruiters still talk to me about positions as if I'm a junior developer. You really have to push back with your experience and what you think you're worth.  As for career path I think there's layers in a application that you can become experienced in, and what tech stack a company chooses to implement that layer becomes less important. I consider myself an application/product engineer because I pretty much just make glorified CRUD apps. Whether it's Rails or Node, they're just tools to accomplish the same thing; and the switch to different stacks isn't too difficult. ||||| Just use something generic like "Software Developer".  There's no need to list the specific stack. *Most* people only work with a limited set of technologies in any given job (a language, some frameworks, a couple of supporting tools, etc.) -- no one's expecting that you were keeping up with multiple stacks. I mean, sure, it happens, but usually you'll be working with one thing, especially if it's a job right out of college.  It's entirely possible to switch stacks. Lots of people hop around throughout there careers. Others stay in the same stack because they like it. It completely depends on the person. ||||| Titles don't matter much if at all. It's certainly acceptable to just put "Software Engineer" and list the specific technologies you worked with. ||||| It doesn't matter at all.  For the kinds of companies worth working for, title doesn't matter. Ability and proven record of success do. ||||| You don't have to put the exact job title in your resume. *cough* I've renamed my titles in the resume to make them more readable  Titles I've held in the past, which all basically mean the same thing:  * Senior Core Java Developer (translation: Senior Software Developer, I actually had to do more dotNET coding than Java...) * Systems Programmer (translation: Software Developer) * Software Engineer (translation: Software Developer) * Programmer Analyst (translation: Software Developer)
7558	1,3,3,3	11	[deleted] ||||| On the first day I got my 15" rMBP I changed a lightbulb. Somehow, the lightbulb dropped out of the shade onto my new screen. (We have high ceilings, I needed to stand on a chair to reach)  The lightbulb shattered by hitting the screen.  The screen has two minor marks on it – you can't notice unless you look really carefully. From this anecdotal experience, I'd say that unless you plan to throw glass at you screen more than once, it's probably fine.  The screen is awesome – covering it up with shitty plastic seems a bad idea. ||||| I have wondered that but in my year of ownership I have never had a scratch. I use a fuzzy finger cloth to clean it every so often.  One thing is to always check if there is something like a pen or flash drive up on the keyboard while closing it. I heard horror stories of someone closing the clamshell with something inside and cracking the screen. ||||| Personally I wouldn't. The keyboard and edge of the screen are already extremely close when you close it. Since the glass and LCD are fuzzed so closely and overall the retina display is so sensitive I got three dead pixels and a "dent" that resulted from a keyboard protector (apple took it back). Any extra stuff between the keyboard and screen may result in denting your screen. If you get a crumb or small hard in there and you close it, it may dent it. I don't know if you would need one really.

8136	1,3,3,3	5	In Wind Through the Keyhole, we see a gun that is described as follows: "It was about a foot long, the gripping handle of wood, the trigger and barrels of dull metal. The barrels numbered four, bound together by bands of what looked like brass. The holes at the end, where whatever it shot came out, were square."  Additional description details [here]([URL]  (Scroll up two paragraphs from top of that page)   I don't know anything at all about guns, but I'm trying to figure out if this is an actual "earthly" gun or if this was something that was homemade and/or cobbled together in Midworld. It seems too long for a handgun and too short for a rifle, even a sawed off, and I can;t think of any gun with square barrels. That is the part that makes me most suspicious that this gun did not come from our level of the tower. So, anyone know what the hell it is? I am not finished with the book yet and have yet to read DT 5-7, so if the answer involves spoilers (or if it's explained later) please just tell me that I will find out later. Thanks! ||||| Probably inspired by a Lancaster antique pistol, but as to why the barrels would be square I have no idea ||||| Yeah... the description made me think of a funky lookin Lancaster too... square barrels? Bound by copper? That part threw me. I think this was King building his own fancy improvised gun. I haven't read WTTK yet but it sounds like an improv.  ||||| I'm no gun expert but afaik, a square barrel bore(hole) would not work. I suppose you could fire a projectile through a square hole but it would tumble and aiming would be impossible. I always thought it was purely fiction, only allowed on that level of the tower.

2881	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	27	Hello Mommas out there. It's been awhile since I"ve posted to here. I need a little help. I was away for awhile and living in a shelter. They did not allow internet or computers of any kind. My son and I are back home now and we have run into a little trouble.   I need some of your help. We have no money. I'm not asking for money, but perhaps if you have any extra diapers that you might be able to send. I have a little guy. He's 4mo. He'll be 5 mo. in about 2 weeks. He's  16.2lbs. I was just hoping that some one out there somewhere would have some extra diapers lying around and didn't know what to do with. I really really would appreciate your help.   I usually buy diapers online at diapers.com in bulk. It is cheaper that way for me, than going to a store around where I live. I am running dangerously low. I have about 35 left. I've ran through all of my savings and this financial situation has really got me worried. All this worry has sorta made me dry up a little bit too. I have food stamps and am starting to now realize that ALL Of it will be going to his formula. That's part of the reason why I started BF'ing to begin with, its free food for my little guy! But I have dried up. Anyway. I'm looking into other sources for help. I should be all set there. But for right now, if you have any diapers or formula. Any at all, that would be a big help. I would be very very grateful.  Thank you for your time. Thank you so much for your time.   EDIT: someone suggested I create a wishlist from amazon. So I did. here is the link [URL]  Thank you so much for the advice! White Vinegar + water  = excellent cleaning solutions for everything. Thank you for the support.  EDIT: Thank you so much to the people who have helped me out with diapers and advice. People have said that they will send me diapers. I am wicked excited and super grateful for all the help, and advice. Thank you to the people who had helpful suggestions. I appreciate that too. There were some things that I had completely forgotten about but were really good ideas. :D  Edit: I got on wic today, which helps out with formula. YES!!! Also. JOb interview TOMORROW! I really hope I do well. I get nervous. It's just a waitress job, nothing too fancy. But i'm super excited. I feel good about this. ||||| Wic benefits kick in immediately. Just make sure you have all the paperwork you need for your first appointment (call to see what you need as each office is different). As long as you qualify they print up your checks at that first appointment.  Post on Freecycle and craigslist seeing if anybody has spare diapers. You could also ask for a few cloth diapers. That way if you ever run low again, you have a backup.  ||||| Hey Emma, I wanted to get you some Amazon stuff but there's no shipping address! Could you pm it to me?  ||||| Fenugreek- it's a supplement that will bring your milk back! And I agree with the other 2 comments. Get on wic! The money you'll save on food and formula you can use for diapers. Now that you have the Internet look up local churches and see if they can help. Or united way?  I'm sorry I can't help you further. Good luck :) ||||| There's also programs where people will donate breastmilk.  Maybe you can find one of those around your area?  I have nothing against formula, but I'm under the impression that taking donated breastmilk would cost you nothing. ||||| I've got some stuff I can send you.  PM me your address. ||||| If you call 1-800-284-9488, it is Gerber's formula line. They will send you a free 12.something ounce can of formula within a week if you talk to them :) I did that last week. I'm on WIC and it was very easy to get on. They were really helpful, and I walked out the door with checks for formula and healthy food. I believe they also help with breast pumps if you still want to keep breastfeeding. Check out local churches, food drives, etc. I found out there's a nonprofit in my small town that helps people in need get aid, and there's a local church that does diaper giveaways. So, help is there :)  Oh! what size diaper is your kiddo in? I have a couple packs of size 1 diapers, but they say they go from 8-14lbs? I also have some size 2, but they aren't in original packaging. They sat in a drawer and little guy outgrew them.  ||||| I'm still preggers, but I know there are a lot of great programs out there to help. Especially for the baby. Once you get into one, it's a lot easier to get into others. Like Healthy Start, maybe start there? Or when you go into WIC they might know of some programs that can help. Definitely worth taking advantage of. And get into all the baby clubs you can. Like the WinDixie and Publix baby club. They sometimes give you free stuff. Hope that might help! ||||| I dont have any extra money to send diapers, im sorry. But i have some advice... hopefully it helps!  * go apply for WIC. They will help (or fully) cover formula. They can also help you with breastfeeding. You'll even be able to buy veggies, fruits, milk and other healthy items.   * if you dont already, get medicaid. If you already have it, you can get a prescription to get a pump for free. You can use the pump to help you regain your supply.  * find a food pantry. You can get some food for you, they may also have formula, and some will carry other necessities such as feminine products and diapers.  * check out /r/babyexchange. You might have something you can exchange for diapers, or some one can send you coupons. Also check out /r/freebies for anything that you can use.  Good luck, and keep strong.  ||||| If you have food stamps you should also apply for WIC.  WIC will cover your baby's formula, among other food items.

Further, their lack of action on anything is detrimental to the average citizen and is causing pain/suffering.  Any lawyers out there care to chime in? ||||| No, I'm pretty sure conduct needs to rise to the level of willful intent, and also you have to name a specific government employee, who will likely argue plausible deniability, i.e. "I did not authorize policy X."

7998	1,0,3	5	So I remember when I was in high school where I was dealing with SA, and although I didn't really talk to anyone, I added people like crazy from the class I was in. Sure, I didn't really **know** them, but It made me happy nonetheless.  When my birthday came up, and it appeared on my timeline on Facebook and everyone else's, I remember how barely anyone would comment to tell me "happy birthday", or at least recognize my existence (maybe they were just pitying me).  I looked at it in a very negative way, and **I** really hurt myself emotionally. I know I don't deserve anything from anyone without having  earned it, but just seeing other's pages being flooded with special messages made me feel more alone, and even worthless.  I'm glad I'm not using facebook anymore. More so because, even If I don't like to admit it, I still hurt when I see others connect and relate, even on the internet. ||||| >I know I don't deserve anything  Bullshit. You deserve whatever you decide you deserve. You just have to follow through with it.  Ask yourself what you honestly want. Do you want to be recognized by all the folks you've added? Do you perhaps want to be recognized by a small handful of them, or just one or two special ones? Or, possibly, does the whole thing cause you too much discomfort, and you honestly only care about the birthday notifications because other people are getting them and you are not?  Any of these are totally reasonable things to want. You just have to decide which one is for you, and what comes with them.   If you want EVERYONE to send you a notification, get ready to be a social butterfly and re-assert your online social media presence in a big way, messaging everyone and re-establishing friendships and lines of communication. If that's not what you want, feel free to focus on the people you *do* care about, and get to know them well. And if you just want to be left the fuck alone and not deal with anyone, that's fine, too - you just need to come to peace with that, and the fact that your wall will stand devoid of "HAPPY BURFDAY =3 =3 =3" for yet another year.  Be real with yourself. You literally owe yourself that. Decide what you're comfortable with, what you want, and work towards that. ||||| I always found it incredibly fake that people would comment or not. Everyone only comments because Facebook reminds them of a birthday, and lots of people just think they're doing it to make themselves look good. I turned my birthday date to hidden and didn't even look at FB on my last bday. Be glad you're outside of that ridiculous social loop. :)

6009	1,3	4	Hey guys so i need to quit smoking weed. Ive been smoking everyday since gr 9(23m). I quit a few years ago for a couple of months and felt great. Then some girl pissed me off and i started smoking again. Weed makes me really anti social. I can barely hold up a conversation with anyone. Im starting a summer business and i need to be out talking be friendly. Any advice would be appreciated thanks ||||| Know that the first 96-hours are absolutely the hardest and this is where you're going to be tested if you're ready for the new you.  You are.    I want you to imagine the moment you first started smoking Weed.   Imagine, for a moment, your life if you chose NOT to smoke that day.  What if you said "no" each and every time?  Where would you be now?   Who are you with?    Chances are, you're imaginging a You that has accomplished more and is with someone you never thought you would be with.   With Weed in your life, you'll always be trapped in your own head.  You'll limit your world to a point where there is nothing left but your Weed and your thoughts.  You wont have the passion or motivation to act on any of the 'great ideas' you come up with and that's the TRAP.  Weed allowed us to expand our minds but prevented us from acting on the thoughts and ideas we created.  THAT IS [THE TRAP]([URL]

8964	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	34	Anyone know of a good casual sushi place near Minneapolis? My wife and I had a standing 'sushi Friday' before we moved here in December, and we would like to continue that tradition. Most of the places we have found so far have been good, but 'special occasion-y'.  I'm looking for a decent every week kind of place that isn't going to be $100 a pop. The best location would be Downtown or Northeast Minneapolis, but we are willing to drive to the 'burbs if need be.    Edit: Thanks for all the awesome recommendations everyone, at the very least we have a lot of new places to try in the upcoming weeks!  ||||| Mount Fuji near Hennepin/Lagoon. They have a great happy hour. ||||| I have a friend who works at Wasabi off of Washington in Mpls...   they have great happy hour specials on both drinks and sushi! ||||| [Masu Sushi]([URL] is just east of downtown on Hennepin.  Minneapolis's star chef, Tim McKee of La Belle Vie, is also the executive chef of this place.  The sashimi is fresh, the sushi is expertly crafted, and the prices modest for the quality.  If you're looking for something simpler, with an atmosphere more casual and laid back, I recommend [Sushi Tango]([URL] in Calhoun Square.  They have more of an energetic atmosphere, as well as tasty, well crafted rolls.  I recommend sitting at the sushi bar, and interacting with the sushi chefs.  They are well trained, very friendly and personable, and they love to imbibe.  Still not finding what you're looking for?  There is my personal favorite, [Origami]([URL]  I prefer the Ridgedale Mall location to the downtown one, but really it's just splitting hairs.  Hands down the best sushi in Minneapolis.  Still a fairly laid back atmosphere and having sashimi so fresh you'll be thinking about it for days.  I could go on and on, but you may have already been there.  If you haven't, please do...as a treat.  While you're there, order the whole Jack Mackerel.  Its sweet and silky, without being fishy.  Finally, if you _still_ have not found something appealing, my last recommendation is [Fuji Ya]([URL]  Located near Lyndale and Lake, this place is also fantastic, and similarly priced to Origami.  My favorites here are the seaweed salad, the #9 roll, and the mouth-watering Toro (fatty tuna).  Fuji Ya is more traditional than the others yet still not very formal; it should also be deemed a treat.  Now, go off eat some tasty fishy goodness!  I hope this helps! ||||| I like [Bagu]([URL] in South Minneapolis for casual. [Masu]([URL] in North East is decent. [Oragami]([URL] is really good. ||||| +1 for Fuji Ya (will be there tomorrow night).  Also; [URL] ||||| I want to second iusedtogotodigg in saying Mount Fuji, with the added note that if you can stand to change the day of your outing, they have a happy hour that lasts all weekend. ||||| I recommend Kyoto in Maple Grove.  It's not far off the freeway.  They make all their sushi to order (as they should), and have a $17 all you can eat lunch. ||||| Midori's just off Lake near Hiawatha is more moderately priced than most other sushi places yet still great.  ||||| What are the places you've found so far which are "special occasion-y," as that may affect my recommendations?      I really like Nami and Origami-- both are downtown Minneapolis. They are expensive but both have great sushi, especially Origami.      I really like [Obento-Ya]([URL] which is a small, intimate place close to the U of M (there's plenty of free street parking though). They offer excellent Japanese food in an unusual neighborhood-- their only close commercial neighbors are a hardware store, a tanning place, a coffeehouse and an Afghani restaurant. I have recommended this place to several picky friends and they've loved it.  ||||| Masu in Northeast on Hennepin Ave some killer sushi that won't disappoint. If you are up for a bit of a drive, Yumi's in Excelsior is pretty much the only sushi I will ever eat. It might make more sense to save Yumi's for the summer time "sushi Friday" and enjoy Lake Minnetonka - I think it's always worth the trip. ||||| Happy hour at [Wakame]([URL] in Uptown.  All you can eat places are great but those are once in a blue moon type places for me. $25 a person plus mandatory 18.5% gratuity and not including drinks is still spendy and going home with your pants bursting at the seams every Friday doesn't sound like a good idea to me. ||||| On Sundays and Mondays, Seven Steakhouse in downtown Minneapolis has all you can eat sushi for $30. ||||| Kobe in Plymouth just off 55 is really good and really cheap - Link for ++ awesome: [URL] ||||| If you are willing to drive a little bit for a great deal try [Akita]([URL] in Woodbury. During lunch hours they have a $15 all you can eat menu including at least ten maki tons of sushi, don, soba, spring rolls, tempura. Heck its the full menu but all you can eat. And made to order so its fresh! I do this once a month with my pals cause its a deal too good to pass up! ||||| Oishi in Brooklyn Center is a nice little place.  Real cheap most times.  They have lunch specials under 10 bucks.  No beer though. ||||| Aji in Hopkins. They have a weekday sushi lunch buffet for 16 monies, and it's actually really good.  ||||| Osaka. If you just want to do sushi you can sit at a booth or the bar/sushi bar instead of a hibachi table, low key but delish. ||||| [Kyoto]([URL] sushi.  All you can eat and 15$ for lunch. Really impressed with how fresh and delicious it was. ||||| If you're from either coasts, the sushi scene here can be a little disappointing.  If you're adventurous, try the local Hmong bars in st. paul, they're a little gritty but the bar food is good and the sushi is quite good.  Its a neighborhood joint afterall, so don't expect a benihana kind of atmosphere.  I would NOT recommend sushi tango in Calhoun Square, but I would recommend the Woodbury one.  If you want to have some sushi with a local flair, I would say go there.... ask for the Hmong style sushi.  Like seriously, its actual spice.... Thai/Lao style of cooking in sushi form.  And seriously ask them to give you non-white people spice.  Its worth it.    Try:  Seafood Laab, Tuna Takakki, spicy taco salad.  And again, insist on the actual Asian spice and not the crappy banana pepper jalapeno siracha junk.  Oh, off the menu stuff like grilled salmon head is great!!!  Not saying I'm a sushi connoisseur, but I've had sushi from all over.  The best you can hope for is quality ingredients, good service, and good drinks. At least in the twin cities, you can get something that isn't found in other places. Who wants another philly roll anyway.  feel free to ask if you want details.   ||||| [7sushi]([URL] is by far the best quality,price, location (downtown mpls), and I work there so i could hook it up.
8806	1,3,3,3	6	I'm going the statutory declaration route to change my name, but I'm not sure what documents I need to change my gender marker. Do I need to explicitly state my gender change on the statutory declaration? Or, like the passport change needs, is the letter from my doctor confirming gender dysphoria enough? I'm a bit lost :(  Edit: Seems that a statutory declaration is enough to change your name, and accompany it with a letter from your doctor confirming the gender transition. That's good enough for the passport, according to [URL] ||||| As far as I can tell the UK has not one but a million places your records are stored, so like passports you need a letter from a doc saying you really are changing gender forever and keeps.  Drivers licence you basically just apply for a new one and make sure to write "new number please coded female, transitioning gender" in the comments box as far as I can tell.  Then hassle your GP and get them to update the NHS records (may take a few attempts before they stop sucking) and then basically chase down banks, ISPs, utilities and ever other git and deal with their own internal systems.  Good luck, keep a list, tick things off :) ||||| Just in terms of changing your NHS gender marker, what I did was to write directly to the CCG asking for them to change it, and they did it all without me needing to get my GP involved - hopefully your GP will sort it for you, but if not, or if you'd rather not have to deal with your GP, a letter to the CCG should do the trick (though I guess this might vary from county to county). ||||| If only it worked like that. You need the government's special "Are you tranny enough?" panel to give you permission and two years RLE is one of the criteria.  The process is outlined in the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and what you're looking for is a Gender Recognition Certificate. Google should give more information.  Sorry, hun.

6412	1,3,3,3	6	In a recent video Andrew mentioned using the number of rooms in a house as a feature. This is a discrete value, not continuous - I was wondering how this would affect gradient descent. ||||| Well, in the case of a computer doing gradient descent we are already operating on a discretized grid, and we only have a discrete number of samples anyways.  So basically you assume everything to be real-valued anyways, and if those values happen to fall directly on integers the algorithm doesn't really know the difference.  I do know that when you add constraints to such problems, such as minimizing some objective function subject to a constraint that say rooms in a house must be less than 4 (all integers) and the square footage less than 2000.2 sq.ft (not incredibly realistic...) then you get into mixed integer programming, which can fall into a computationally harder class of problems, though still probably solvable in a lot of cases.  [URL] ||||| My answer differs from the other posts so correct me if I'm wrong please.  The gradient descent works on the hypothesis, not the features. The hypothesis is continuous, never discrete. ||||| You can do linear regression as normal on discrete values, as long as those values are ordinal. This means that there is a logical ordering to them, so number of rooms works.  For instance, number of rooms can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Clearly there is an intermediate value between 1 and 3, which is 2. Even though there is no physical meaning to 1.5 rooms, it still has a logical value.  In contrast, there is also nominal coding. Let's say that I code Manhattan = 1, Queens = 2, Brooklyn = 3, Staten Island = 4, The Bronx =5. Now the number 3.5 is meaningless and a different method has to be used to do the regression.

5783	1,3,3,3	4	 I always forget [this]([URL] old thing even exists. No doubt about it, it is important for new players to be introduced to all of the summoner spell options but I don't think this is an effective way to do it. It might be more influential to include the spells in the tutorial (just a suggestion, feel free to comment any ideas you may have). I think it might be more beneficial to have a different tab in its place (pls riot skins tab) or have it removed entirely, assuming a different approach is found.  TLDR: The spells tab is easy to forget about. ||||| I don't know about you but I'd like to see some more summoner spells period  ||||| I found that tab after i hit lvl 30. ||||| Well once you learn what all of them do, you never have to visit it again.

By not staying adequately hydrated, your mouth dries up. Now, because your mouth is a warm, dark, and moist place, it's a wonderful breeding ground for bacteria and shit that's gonna make your breath smell like a week old pork roast.

Edit:  Even with all the BS aids turned on this is still frustrating. WTF?  Any suggestions? ||||| I went back and did the Suzuka race a few days ago just for gigs. Yes, they are assholes. The most important piece of advice I can give you is to just be patient. Take your time with the overtakes, and don't expect to be in first after the first lap, or the second, or the third. In fact, it might take the entire first half of the race before you get in first.  If you're looking for an easy win, start the race, quit, then restart over and over again until it's raining.

7786	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	14	Hello reddit, question to the more experienced folks.   Me (m21) and my gf (f20) have been together for a couple of months now. We are each others first everything, real relationship, kiss, sex. Been having sex for a bit over a month now and we're having a lot of fun. Looking on the Internet for fun stuff to try, we noticed that everyone does oral, a lot apparently. It's something we never tried. She offered to give me a bj once,  that was before we had sex for the first time, but I told her not to bother since we were having fun with our hands and I somehow feel that it is disrespectful to her. She agreed and we never talked about it again.  About eating her out, never done it but will try it because I simply really want to try it just to know what the fuss is about. She things it might be a bit disgusting to put my mouth there, but we both like to experiment so it is worth trying.   Anyway,  my question. What are your views on bjs? I just somehow feel that it's not very respectful for my gf. It somehow feels like I don't love her as person, or is that just me?  ||||| Well, of course it is totally okay for you to feel that way. However you should ask yourself why you feel that way.  Giving or receiving oral is about pleasuring your partner. I (F) personally only give oral for that purpose, to pleasure the one I love (or like). I don't feel disrespected because it is my choice to do so and as long as I am happy and he is happy, everything is fine. ||||| There will be better / more articulate responses than mine, but bjs are awesome. Its not degrading whatsoever, but I can understand where you're coming from. Your SO just wants to please you and you should want to please her, oral and flowers are the way to a woman's heart. ||||| Try a 69. It is a great way to enjoy yourself and her at the same time, it takes pressure off the situation by bringing your faces away from one another, and it feels fucking great.  ||||| Almost anything is ok/flies in bed. I like giving oral to gf, tho i've never finished when F is giving me one. If you haven't tried it (receiving/giving) - why not. Maybe you/she will like it. Disgusting, meh i've done more disgusting things with my mouth and you brush your mouth next morning anyway. While i haven't yet given oral during period i don't find it disguisting either. Don't say no to something until you've tried it at least once is how i live my life both in bed and other affairs.  ||||| If she's worried about it being clean you guys can take a bath together.  ||||| They are required.  Oral is a requirement in a relationship for both sides.

3716	1,3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3	12	Hello crusaders! This guide is made for a composition that I found very fun to play.    I have another guide specifically on Thor/Mew/Korin that I climbed PvP with to 1% during the most recent week. It can be found here:    [URL]    This guide focuses another composition focusing on stuns and debuffs.     HOW TO USE TEAM: Though this team composition does have 1-block spammy heroes, it is far more complex than the mindless 1block spam of the infamous sus/insert hunter here/insert hunter here compositions. The first thing to focus on in this team composition is timing 1block debuff from Susanoo with the 1block stun from Cain. It’s quite easy to do but if improperly timed with Cain’s attack, you will severely decrease the number of stuns you can achieve. The second thing to keep track of are Kriemhild’s blocks. You will never want to use anything less than a 3block with her. What makes this composition successful is that the stun mechanics are completely independent of one another. That is you can stun with Cain + Sus without needing Kriemhild blocks and vice versa. With this in mind, stuns can be and should be used to buy time to set up for each other’s combos which leads to a near permastun effect.     FOR THIS COMPOSITION.    The units include:    1) Kriemhild    2) Susanoo    3) Cain    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    IN DEPTH UNIT ANALYSIS.    1) Hero : Kriemhild (FREE)    This gal can be obtained through the Gravity dungeon. She’s quite a tanky unit being a legendary and rivals Alex in tanky stats. However, she far surpasses most if not all the paladins in damage output. Her 6* passive allows her to do 380% hero attack damage for every autoattack for 3 seconds. As a comparison, Leon’s 3 block passive only allows to do 380% once although there is some armor penetration there. On top of the massive damage boost, she gets a 0.75 stun for every autoattack up to 3 times. That totals to 2.25 seconds of total stun duration + some knock back distance. The only longer stun duration in the game for a single skill is The Holy Hammer which stuns for 3 seconds (also probably Sasquatch + trans mana recycle but who cares about him anyways). Armed with this ability, she can fit into a lot of teams that require both a tanky frontline as well as damage.         ~    Skill of choice : Revolution Hammer (trans or untrans)    Pros:    *Deals magic damage    *Though the proc rate is not high, it hits many times a second (about 3 hammers per second, ~70% stun chance per second)    *transcended version allows for a lot of sp gained if hitting multiple enemies    *can stack with other Revolution Hammers (no limit)    *stuns    CONS    *slow to cast    *makes it difficult to see animations    *lowish stun duration    *low damage    ~    Skill of choice : Shield of Invincibility (trans or untrans)    *Immunity from all damage    *instant cast    *transcended will make team immune to debuffs as well    Cons    *no damage    *no stun    ~    IN CONCLUSION: Kriemhild is a very solid hero that is quite underplayed at the moment. She has amazing utility with her passive as well as legendary stats. Some drawbacks however include that her passive can be negated by Dionne and pushback effects such as Sneak’s passive (being melee can be a huge pain). However, once she lands her first autoattack with passive effect, she can easily stick on targets and pummel them down to bits.     ~    Weapon of choice : Volcano, Spinning axe    Volcano- Offense: Hero attack %, Defense: %dmg reduction, Function: Attack speed %    Spinning axe – Offense: Hero Attack %, Function(s): Attack speed/Critchance ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    2) Hero : Cain (Premium Contract only!)    I initially started playing with Cain since the RNG gods blessed me with 3 of these. Cain is a niche hero that requires a bit of set up before he can really kick into action. There are some popular compositions that include him however such as pairing him with Nazrune (everything debuffs) and Himiko (DEBUFFS 4DAYZ). His passive allows him to stun targets that have been previously debuffed for 1 second with a 65% chance to (basically) stun again (they do not chain off each other). Despite being a paladin however, he is quite squishy for one. He is best used as in a supportive role as his blocks do not do very high damage either. But since his passive can activate off of any block type (1,2, or 3), it provides him many opportunities for triggering his passive.     ~    Skill of choice : Holy Hammer (trans or untrans)    Pros:    *Deals significant damage    *stun duration is very long    *can heal (trans)     Cons:    *Very slow to activate    *easily missed due to poorly timed activations    *can be interrupted    ~    Skill of choice: Shield of invincibility (see above)    ~    Skill of choice: Revolution hammer (see above)     ~    Skill of choice: Oppression of power     Pros:     *Deals fairly good damage (500%)    *Potentially double stuns and knockup    *Has a wide area of effect (easy to hit)    Cons:    *transcended passive is somewhat unreliable (only 50% proc rate)    *suffers from the same cons as Holy Hammer   Weapon of choice : Any weapon with defensive stats    It really does not matter what kind of weapon you choose as long as it has defensive stats (damage reduction). Cain’s damage is quite low so any damage booster will make little impact.     IN CONCLUSION: Currently, Cain is one of the weaker paladins out there. He is squishy and does suboptimal damage with his attacks. But as a support he can swing the match into your favor with his stuns. With enough patience and set up, he can easily take down some of the best teams currently.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    3) Hero : Susanoo (credit to crabappless for some analysis)    His passive allows synergizes well with both Cain and Kriemhild. Since it is a debuff, it allows Cain to use his passive. It is also a very quick animation which allows for easier stunning windows if paired with Cain. For Kriemhild, as mentioned before, it lacks the armor penetration that Leon’s passive allows. Susanoo fills in this gap for her and basically allows her passive to basically deal true damage to the front and backlines. Apart from synergies, Susanoo’s damage is very significant often rivaling Kriemhild’s in the course of a match.     Skill of choice : Heaven's Slash or Spinning Storm.    Heaven's Slash. Although tosses enemies into the air and causes shots to miss, is chosen primarily because of its large damage output.    Spinning Storm. Spinning Storm can be used over Heaven's Slash as it clumps the enemies together, making it easier for your DPS's to hit. But this is not a popular choice, I shall elaborate below.    Note that Susanoo's main purpose is to initiate the Sword Shot for armor reduction, and usually will not be able to use the skill in time because of the fast damage output by No.9/Sneak. Thus people choose skills for Susanoo that are ideal for cleanup and damage, i.e Heaven's Slash.    Weapon of choice : 5* Killer Sword    Conversions should be for Hero Attack Power to maximize his armor shredding capabilities and neutral damage. (credits to LoLElegance)    IN CONCLUSION: Aside from the 1block spams that other teams put him in, Susanoo fits this composition perfectly as his single ability can provide for the passives of his allies. He can serve as a backup damage dealer if Kriemhild (leader) dies and his neutral damage can hit every member of the opposing team. This makes him ideal for hitting clumped up teams which Kriemhild usually does with stuns + knockback with her passive.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    TEAMS TO LOOK OUT FOR WHEN USING KSC    Sasquatch/filler/tank    Sasquatch has single handily screwed me more times than I can count. His passive (updated reduces even more damage) as well as the stun over time effects really put this team in a tough spot as all three Melee heroes will be hit by it. Try to avoid Sasquatch as much as possible as once the AI gets going with the chains, your heroes will not be able to move or do any damage.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Teams that you should always win against:    Hunter/hunter/hunter    Assuming that you can engage at the beginning of the fight with either a cain/sus combo or a Kriemhild 3chain, this team composition should melt before they can get any shots off at all. You should always bing Dionne, however, in case you get all cain blocks or something.    ~    Healer/healer/DPS    This composition gets crushed as soon as Kriemhild hits the first stun effect. Since most heals in this game can be negated/delayed by stuns, this team (a team that has nothing but stuns to offer) will pin the healers to the right wall and use them as a punching bag.     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    About 70/30 in your favor    Susanoo/hunter/hunter   Like with the healer heavy teams, this compositions is easily stunned by Kriemhild and are very squishy. However, if the AI gets a Susanoo shot on you and the hunter catches you with your pants down, Sus or Cain is most likely going to get 1-2 shotted. In short, this matchup is pretty one sided towards you but goddess timing can make break who wins this match.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    About 60/40 in your favor    Alex/Sus/hunter   This is a more resilient version of the Sus/hunter/hunter mentioned above. I find this version to be scarier just because Alex is there to absorb the stuns and damage. Though you will find that you will down Alex quite fast, since your team lacks Alex, this might give the AI the window it needs to kill your team faster. Anut is very helpful in this match up as it protects your guys from some damage as well as allow your stuns to reach the DPS in the back.  ~   Magic Storm teams   These types of teams basically a punching bag about 10 seconds into the match. But as soon as the first magic storm hits, expect at least one of your 3 melees to die. There isn’t really a good mechanism to deal with the incoming damage of Magic Storm or from AOE hitting magic spells (Nazune) so the best way here is to stun and kill them before they get the chance! Lucky for us, wizards are very low armor so killing them won’t be hard if you can get there.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    About 50/50    Alex/healer/Mondrian   Ah, we hit the Mondrian wall again. He does so much damage so quickly and after the patch, nullifies even more of your damage! Alex is quite difficult to get through and the sustain from the healer can really screw your combos. Though not nearly as bad as the Sasquatch match up, it’s another toss up of whether you can reach Mondrian in time or not. Stuns from tMR will really hurt your chances of winning if you give the AI the opportunity to.         Well Thanks for reading my guide! Feel free to point out mistakes I made or provide comments!  ||||| feels like alot of team composition is build around Susanoo, glad that I finally got him today through promotion.  ||||| Why not Holy Hammer on Kreim? It seems to be the skill of choice in her similar team where Alex replaces Cain.  ||||| For Cain, his stun range depend on his model. So with bella and avatar, he can stun with longest range. ||||| What's your take on Mondeuk teams? I rarely see them in PvC so I'm not sure how the AI plays them but Mondeuk can't be stunned and has 50% DR when he's on his horse and typically the heroes behind him are 3 chain massive burst heroes. If the AI chases 3 chains (no idea if it does), wouldn't this team setup be problematic for a melee team where stunning is a integral strategy? ||||| I never see anyone suggest pairing sasquatch with Cain, but they seem like a perfect match. Sasquatch debuffs with a single block and Cain stuns will help keep them under the ice so they take the maximum damage and get restunned. I was actually considering this duo paired with kriem for maximum stun uptime (though sasquatch as lead might pan out better).  ||||| I dread those magic storm teams. It really comes down to who ends up with better blocks in the first 6 - 8 seconds. ||||| The most threatening enemy for these units is Archon his stun+energy balls will own your team. Even for 3  maxed units he can kill you if unlucky. Solution:  bring a Anut to dispel archon buff's ||||| Hehe, if you put trans MR on Rachel, you can get a 5 second stun.  Just saying.

4512	1,3,3,3	10	Padraig Tuathail, captain of the city guard, stood before the door to the royal quarters. Iron bound oak towered almost twelve feet overhead, flanked by two torches with flames burning lazily in their sconces. *The pyromancers never stood a chance*. He wiped sweat from his brow as the image of the dying men burned into his mind. *We should have been more prepared. If only we had more time*. There was no time for remorse though; he had a king to face. Usually  the thought of having to face the king would terrify Padraig, but tonight he’d rather take his chances with his majesty than have to face the undead hoard that were scaling the castle walls.   He looked back at the Great Hall. Once the central social hub of the inner keep, tonight it housed hundreds of frightened women and children, sheltered from the violence outside. Mothers tried to hush their crying babies while others prayed for the gods to save them. The sound of weeping and frail lament filled the air, but it did nothing to drown out the cries of the dead and dying from outside across the moat. Two young boys were playing dice beneath a portrait of St. Lorcan. *They are faring much better than those who were sought refuge in the cathedral*, Padraig reminded himself. The thought struck his heart and weakened his knees. *Aideen... I should have stayed with you.*  ||||| I think the story would benefit from describing the main characters feelings more. Before the mention of the undead I had no idea there was some sort of crisis or stress going on. I also thought the place was desolate, from the lack of sounds being described. Because there's no descriptions telling you how Padraig feels, you get the picture that he isn't feeling much. ||||| Consider removing "almost" from the second sentence. Your prose will gleam if it's more decisive. Of course, there's always exceptions, as there are to every rule.  Describe how the pyromancers died instead of merely telling us. This will make Padraig's emotional response more powerful and evocative.   Your prose has great rhythm, and your grammar is solid. Keep it up. ||||| I think the sentence "Usually the thought..." could benefit from taking out "having to face" as you have recently mentioned that phrase and I knew that's what you were talking about.  Ha! Love the image of the "undead hoard scaling the castle walls".  Which makes me think, there is a bit of urgency in this passage? So what do you think of changing the word 'lazily' refering to the torches. If it was a bit more dynamic you could hint at the atmosphere right there?  I'm no expert on tenses, but would it "sheltering" rather than "sheltered"?  I'm not sure the two boys playing dice really fits with the tone, especially just after you mention they can hear the cries of the dead and dying  ... are they that callous, or are they trying to distract themselves?  Otherwise I like it, it reads really well.

1846	1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3	29	I know. I have waited FAR TOO LONG to get a test kit (I have had an ammonia test kit since the set up of my tank a year ago, so I'm not that bad..but still...yep)  I've got a 40g breeder heavily planted (wisteria, ludwigia, amazon sword, and various crypts)  Dose flourish liquid fertilizers 2x a week and carbon supplement daily (using API since I ran out of flourish excel but I will be going back to excel in a week)  I had my tank stocked with 2 pearl gourami, 2 honey gourami, 2 german blue rams, 8 guppies, 5 otos, and 4 panda corydoras. Besides the panda corys I have had all of these fish for 10 months before they started dying off.  The panda corys did not last long in my tank and all of them are deceased.  I lost 3 guppies, one honey gourami, both blue rams, and 2 otos in the span of about a month!  This all coincided with an algae bloom of black beard, green spot, and hair algae.   I think the algae may have something to do with my lighting being inadequate. I had 2 spiral CFL's (6500k, 23watts) that seemed to grow my plants pretty well for the past year but I think maybe the spectrum is degrading?  I stuck 2 more bulbs on there of the same type and I am going to replace the other two soon.  Ok now for the results of the water tests:  Phosphates: .75ppm GH: 9 KH: 7 Ammonia: 0 Nitrite: 0 Nitrates: 5.0ppm pH: 8.3  SO my analysis would be that my phosphates are a little high as are my nitrates.  Is this correct? ALSO my pH is obviously too high for all of my fish who require neutral to slightly acidic water!  It comes out of the tap at 8.2 and I think that this may have caused the issues with my fish death...but I still don't know why its just happening now? I have lived in this place for 5 months and all of a sudden mass extinctions!!  I do not have any driftwood in my tank but I am thinking about using it to help lower the pH?  I would really love a bit of help deciphering these numbers and getting a game plan on how to make my tank better for the fish and to combat that algae!  I have been considering setting up DIY CO2...but probably will just stick with excel for now. Thanks in advance guys!! ||||| Any symptoms from your fish before they went terminal? Red gills, odd swimming, listing, etc?  Are you still losing fish, and did you resolve your algae outbreak?  Also, assuming your PH hasn't suddenly shifted, it should be fine in the 8 range. Most common fresh water fish are tank bred, and adapt well to a range of water conditions.  ||||| Are you using a de-chlorinator when you do water changes? ||||| How much Excel are you using? Overdosing can be fatal to fish. But I have to say, it sounds all a bit odd, as I disagree with the toxins in the water theory as all your fish would have died pretty much at once. I've experienced it, its fairly obvious when it happens.  Also, adding more light for algae is not a good idea, you're just growing more of it!! Less light is whats needed.  As for the dead fish... could be all manner of things. But at the end of the day, sometimes you are just unlucky. Keep trying - I think if there was a major, major problem, you'd be seeing far worse numbers and all your fish dead. ||||| Those numbers seem fine.  None of them are extreme enough to be the cause of your fishs death.  Do you treat your water when you change it?  Your tap may contain some metals that are toxic to the fish. ||||| Since fish of different types all died- and it doesn't look like the tank crashed from the test results- I would have to say it is some kind of toxicity problem or a hidden, internal type parasite.

4181	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	40	I noticed (through instagram) that B&M stores and even some individuals are selling fasttech products and straight up just rip people off. I saw that one store was selling the Sentinel Clone for $70 and people were all over it. Are you kidding me? That thing goes for $18 on Fasttech's website! Someone commented on one of their pictures telling people about fasttech and the comment was then deleted. This kinda bothers me how people are making a huge profit based on the less-aware vaping community. I know, a business is intended to make profit, but if you're charging $70 for something that can be bought for $18 that's just fuct up. Thoughts? ||||| Consider that the value of a thing is *what people are willing to pay.* and that FastTech is basically a wholesale portal to China that just happens to cater to consumers directly. How much do you think your laptop, tv or phone cost to make? It doesn't matter how much it cost in materials, what matters is marketing, location, branding etc. etc... The people who end up paying $70 for a FastTech mod aren't necessarily being ripped off, not if they're satisfied with their device and have that much money to spare. Just like when someone goes to a fancy restaurant, they pay $7 for a salad that cost $0.50 in raw materials, but guess what? People don't feel like they're getting ripped off, they feel they're getting personal service and respond with gratitude. This how you make money, you offer goods and services at a higher price than you bought them for. Now for a markup that high I would expect some serious customer support and immediate replacement or repair of products that were defective or what have you, but if you don't like the price, don't try to mess up the sellers day. Keep your friends informed, but don't be a cock-blocker. ||||| Something is only worth what someone will pay for it. ||||| I am with you on this trust me, BUT B&Ms have to make a profit somehow. They have employees to pay, taxes, rent, utilities, etc. If you think charging $70 for a clone is robbery, you should check the markup on pizzas, burgers, Nike shoes. The list goes on and on. I know it totally sucks for the uninformed, but that's business. Not much we can do except tell people through word of mouth. ||||| As long as they aren't misleading anyone into purchase, I don't see an issue here. How much is convenience worth to you? For some people I guess it's at least $52, can't play the ignorant card when the internet is everywhere and all it would take is a quick google search.  I once paid 20$ for an evod head, I know they go for ALOT cheaper, but it was a newer store, his liquid was the right price and real good, and he was a decent dude. I didn't feel ripped off despite how some would take it. ||||| Commerce, how does it work. ||||| Stores charge the price that people are willing to pay.  We're talking about, essentially, a luxury good.  It's only dishonest if those vendors are labeling clones as originals.  It's quite possible that those customers consider the markup worth the price to have the item *now*, instead of waiting for ship time. ||||| When I bought my MVP, I knew it was on Fasttech for $45. I bought it for $70 from my local B&M (they're great people, very good customer service). I did that because I knew if my MVP ever took a dump I could bring it right back to them for an exchange, repair, or refund. It wouldn't be so easy or fast at Fasttech.   I'll never buy B&M juices, though. I've found most of them to just really suck. ||||| it's called business guys, that's how it works. supply and demand.   ||||| This is how businesses make money, as unscrupulous as it may be. That's just how it works. If everybody knew the cheapest place to buy everything then only the manufacturer would make money, and you'd see no B&M stores, no online vendors, nothing. Essentially we'd lose out.  It's been happening since the beginning of time. $70 is crazy though, I agree.   They're entitled to make some sort of mark up to factor for their overheads as a business, plus people are often willing to pay a premium for a B&M in case they have issues, or want face to face advice etc.  Some people will come to realise, others won't. Educate people you meet, but don't lose too much sleep over it. ||||| Here's the thing, while the best type of advertisement has always been word of mouth its also a double edged sword. You treat a customer good and you've got a customer for life (not all the time but you get what I'm saying). You treat a customer bad and you've lost that customer, their family, and all the friends that they care to tell it to.   Karma has a way of biting people like this in the ass so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  ||||| I see a bunch of the Fasttech stuff on eBay, same triple the price rip offs. I kind of feel for the people who fall for that crap but at the same time, I've taken the time in my 3 months of vaping to learn the hows, whats and whys that are important here. I've got a good collection of nice working gear that I've got great deals on because, well, ignorance is not bliss, it's expensive and/or dangerous and doing your homework pays off. So yeah, it is fucked up that dishonest greedy bastards are part of the reality we live in and I want to throat punch them, but those assholes only survive because of people being too lazy to get informed and shop around. Just one dude's opinion, thanks ||||| I was looking around one of these us based websites that oddly sells almost every vaping related item fasttech does and some of the items had only a couple dollars tacked on above the fasttech prices. That did not seem bad to me considering those products would already in this country, shipping would be quicker and I could talk to an English speaking person about the products I was interested in. So I send them an email with a couple questions...basically they tell me that they keep some items in stock and some drop ship from their supplier... And they could not tell me wether or not they had the items I was asking about in hand or if they were in a warehouse in china...which led me to believe that they have no products on hand at all. That's just bullshit. When it comes to all this cheap chinese stuff, I'm not giving my money to a middle man unless he's doing something to deserve it.  ||||| y'all realize that fasttech is in hong kong? they probably pick up overstock from factories in shenzhen. ||||| Do you realize that wholesale prices are similar, sometimes even less expensive than fasttech?  B&M's buy in bulk, straight from the manufacturer usually, so they get a wholesale price.  Retailers then mark the prices up to make a profit, sometimes a pretty large amount.  If they didn't mark things up, they wouldn't be able to pay the people who work for them, they couldn't pay the rent on the storefront.  Stop bitching about things you have no idea about. ||||| Unfortunately this sort of thing is everywhere. I went into a shopping centre last weekend in Inverness (Scotland) and there was a stand selling an ego starter kit with a 650mah battery, a knock-off ce4, a brand of liquid I couldn't determine, and a usb charger, for £45.  The guy selling it didn't even know what kind of clearo it was until I told him. ||||| Fast tech sells cheap because why?  Volume, volume, volume!  They will sell a thousand of those. B&M will sell not quite so many, so they mark it up, up, up!  Though yeah, that kind of markup is ridiculous. ||||| Yup there is a local B&M that my friend bought his first setup before I could talk to him about what he wanted (and where to get it) and he ended up spending $120 on a Vamo v2 Starter Kit, iClear 30, and a 30ml bottle. ||||| You know, it sucks, but thats they way it works.  If someone is dumb enough to pay for it, why not sell it at that price.  I like to go to the B&M's and see what they got, if I like something i whip out my phone and compare a few site's prices, it it isn't marked up too much i'll buy it there for the convenience, but if it is i just say thanks and go home and order it. ||||| I have been considering going through Fasttech and putting together starter kits for interstate drivers I work with as there are many interested. Looking at 2 Ego C twist 1100 mah batteries, 2 iclear 16's, a charger, a cigarette lighter usb charger and a 30 ml bottle of juice. for around $50 dollars AUD after this I'd be looking at around a $25 dollar profit. Do I feel bad? No. This is roughly the going rate from anyone else around and you don't need to pay the 10 bucks for postage. ||||| It's a business and people make the consious choice to pay that price to buy it.  If they don't choose to do research for other options to purchase it whatever.  Some people have the money and feel its worth the time they save just to pay more as well. ||||| In most industries keystone pricing is the norm, so this isn't unusual. ||||| In the car business we had a old saying " These is a ass for every seat"  ||||| I don't have a problem with it because I can just order from fasttech.  It's just capitalism, I have no problems with people reselling to make a profit, I'm just not going to buy it from them ||||| This is standards of practice for tobacco shops in general. They like to blame tax, but I've been in over two dozen stores selling peter stokkebye's nougat for as much as a 4000% markup over factory price. (8 bucks per .25 ounce at a place in chicago, ouch.... I pay(ed) about 1.25$ish PER OUNCE in bulk from online bulk tobac retailers)   Most of them also re-label it as a house blend, or don't advertise they have stokkebye's products, then you hop in the dumpster, bam. Beautiful silver bags with that big ol' familiar sticker on it.    Which I mention because it seriously would piss me off when I would call 'em out on it, and the shop bitch would lie through their teeth.      I digress, though. This is.... normal. I mean, have you ever wondered how much the crap you buy at walmart costs the walmart? Or, for hippies, how much it costs whole foods, etc?      But on the other hand, as many have said, they have a TON of overhead. they can't move in bulk, generally, like major online retailers, so they need a higher price per item to cover more of that.... and the big advantage locals have, is you can try stuff before you buy, sample juice, take a look at the construction of an item, and pick up something you need in a pinch, so you can't hate 'em for it too much.... depending on the level of insanity.  ||||| That is fucked up.  That is huge profit margin for something that comes with free shipping.  288% Profit on a clone...  B&Ms can't make that much selling the real thing, that come in small batches from the manufacturer.  I hope people that fall for that--who didn't research pricing--at least research/know how to setup a mech mod properly/safely. ||||| There are quite a few B&Ms who -PREY- on the uninformed. The one near me was selling 1000 MaH ego twists (clearly not joy-e tech) for about $45, and selling blatant rip offs of EVODs (they didnt even have ohms written on the head and they called it the terminator tank or something) for about $15 a pop with no spare heads included. BTW, this is Create cig in Houston TX, steer clear of them.

4917	1,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3	13	Hi everyone,  I would like to have your opinion on the project (let’s call it GL) that I am working on for the past year and the thoughts that led me to the realization of GL.  As a player, I've always searched for a place where I can share exciting stuff about games that I’m playing, but I never really wanted to share it with everyone.  This is the reason #1 why I've started this project. And until now, I didn't have found a social network that's games oriented and still considerate your gaming experience as an entity deserving privacies.  Obviously, if the only reason that have pushed me to create GL was the fact I wanted to control what I post, I would have just create a group on FB. Just like our professional life is worthy of a specific social network (ln), I think gaming is worthy of one's too.  Here's a short description of GL & its functionalities:  > > GL is a social network where you can manage your gaming life. Through GL every gamers can: > * Connect with their gamer friends, favourite games, and public gamers > * Share their albums, pictures, videos, and news to whomever they want > * Discover games and players to play with > * Manage their events and groups > * Improve themself by reading guides and watching streams  If you want to know a bit more about functionalities & features that provides GL, here it comes: > * A welcome page where you have access to a newsfeed containing things that your connection have shared, a “player finding” in order to find a gamer to play with on a specific game, a list of games that you don’t possess but matching with the game that you like in general, a list of gamer that you might know and a list of your incoming events. > * A messenger that allows you to talk privately to a friend of to a group of friends (conversation). A chat messenger is also available on every page. > * A library of your games and a way to search for games & add them to your library. On top of that each game has its own page containing various information such as genre, short description, etc. > * The possibility to create characters from any game existing on GL. It’s mandatory to use the “player finding”. > * Anyone can create a page. A page is like your profile, but public. There is no such thing as friends for pages, but followers. In that way, if you want to be a public player, or create a public community, you can do so without sharing your personal profile. > * Guides can be wrote by anybody. You can create as much chapter as you want, and each chapter can contain as much parts as you want. The language used to write those guides is Markdown. It’s used by most of the guides’ website and that shouldn’t ask a lot of work to writers to transfer it to GL. > * Anyone can make reviews for games. Those are always public and can be accessed directly through games’ pages. > * Notifications are sent & received every time actions are made by/for someone who’re connected to you. > * An alias system is available. Every single item on GL can be alias. That can be a user profile, a page, a group, an event or even a picture (well, in theory. In practice this is not tolerate in order to not overwhelm aliases). Aliases can be handy if you want to share, for example, your guild’s group. Your group will be available through the following url: example.com/<your_alias> > * Two to three privacies are available for elements like news, pictures or videos. If you are on your profile, you can share those with anybody, only your friends or only you (great to use as memo). On others “root element” like groups, pages, events, etc. only the first two are available.   Those functionalities are already built and functional, but things are restraining me from launching GL in beta: 1. Your thoughts on the matter: What do you think of it, what do you think is missing, what would you like on a social network, etc. 2. The fact that I’m not that good with webdesign & ergonomics and that GL is still not totally user friendly. 3. Improve a bit some functionalities.  Thank your for reading this post, and if you can give me your thoughts on the matter that will be awesome!  Have a nice day. (Even if I’m not saying what you have to do ;))  N.B: I’m not a native English speaker, I still do a lot of mistakes :p  ||||| Isn't that basically Steam? ||||| I think something like this already excists.

It has been done enough. ||||| The proposition of joining another social network is daunting to me. I have Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and I scour reddit constantly, and even out of those, I'm not as active on Facebook or Twitter as I'd like. Throw in all the other ancillary things like Vine, Instagram, etc that I don't use but have accounts for and GL sounds like it would fit in the group of stuff I don't have time for.  It's a neat idea. The thing that would sell it for me is a cross platform app that is on the web, mobile, PC, Xbox, and Playstation. Having it span consoles and PC and mobile would make it worthwhile to me, because I could still have conversations and see progress with friends on different systems. ||||| [removed]

7236	1,0,2,3,3,3,3	7	This is something that I have been thinking about for the past few days, and yes I know that not everyone will agree but that does not mean that you have to say hurtful, nasty things about it. We are all people, only trying to all live togather and advance, an better our way of life for every living thing; Human, plant and animal or other wise.   An some where in history we got way from this idea and it being the soul reason of why we are on this plant. We need to strengthen our morals, ethics and vaules with a new way of thinking and a system that would be put in place to up hold these.  Having an universal Punishment for any and all human beings that affect other living things in a negitive way. But this does not take in to effect up until an other human, does harm to an other living thing it be physical, emotional, mental or other wise. And that harm that you caused is the governed by every other human, and the amount of harm caused is in return the amount of punishment you will then resive. Making every crime looked at in delait and judged by everyone to a moral and ethical stander of what should be up held over all others. And that is the Idea that we are a Race of people are only trying to become better, advance and grow as a whole. An to better everyones way of life no matter what any one individual, thinks, look like, acts, or beliefs until those do harm to any one living thing on this planet and/or any life that will or wont be found on others, in spaces or any other new area of our universe that has yet to be discovered.  ||||| >Getting back to the core morals and values that our Founding Fathers made this country on.  Your problem is the same one faced by Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, etc., in that the "strict constructionist" approach to history and the law is pretty much entirely an artificial creation, only with a veneer of historical references.  Among the values of our founding fathers were denying women the vote (or even the right to not be raped during marriage), and the right to own (and rape and kill) your fellow human beings, if they were unfortunate enough to be called slaves.  If you want to make up a set of morals and values and argue in favor of them,  go for it, but be aware of both the positives and negatives to attaching your beliefs to figures from history.  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal..."  A noble sentiment, but when you consider that it was written by a man who owned hundreds of slaves, and had six children with a female slave, maybe it's time to think about basing your core morals and values in 2012, and not the late 1700s.  You might not be able to claim as much heritage, but there's a lot less baggage to carry around. ||||| Why is your premise that we have weak morals, ethics and values? What do you mean Universal Punishment and how does that work in the Constitution?  ||||| Everyone thinks, has beliefs, and knows what is right and wrong because of what has accured throughout history. And what intenllgences have/or has been gained throughout that time. Recoreded, found, thought or other wise.  There is an old saying "If you don't learn from the past you are doomed to repeat it". So why haven't we rewritten what is now outdated that governs us as living as a collective whole. We update everything else, how we live, our way of life, technology, ideas, what becomes popular with intelligent creatures, style of art, archeure and so on based on what thoses discover, and think of and becomes to exist.  We all know that life and living creatures are considered to be precious, valued as such and in harming, taking away or cousing anythings existance to be threatend to not exist anymore in what we know as time and space. And what has pasted on to any other existence that is or isn't something that we as intelligent creatures can, will, or will not accept as such. They are still to be respected in the same that is morals, values and ethics are of anyone thing that is considered to be living.  An isn't that the one thing that should be valued more over any one thing in this world; no matter what you think, feel or considered to be or not to be. As having intelligence, that life and helping your fellow other intelligent creature or creatures way of life better in anyway that we can?   At some point in our history and existence as being intelligent creatures we lost this. And we all need to get back to being unified in a common cause as intelligent creatures. ||||| In posting my thoughts and ideas here, I only want to help and better every single living and non living thing on our planet. We all know that something has to change and the way everything is right now with everthing happen, and the hard times we all are facing. I only hope that enough read this, share this post and are open to doing this and a change can occur in our socitey that is and will be in the future. So we all can prosper as a collective whole.  ||||| This would then in Theoy make no one person more important then an other, or have more value that an other as long as an individual is putting forth effert in helping the lives of any and all living things get better. And that effort is then seen as your individual value, which is given and governed by every human being and who much your help, idea, company, invention etc. made thier and everyones lives better and easier. Thus eliminating the need, wont and greed of any one phyical object as in, money and/or gold. The new currancy would be only the value of your own life and what you want to do with it to help every other living things existence be better, and how much effect that help has had on the people, plants animals and other wise. ||||| See and that is where the failure lies. In how the Consitiution was wirtten. It worked and was great for the time and the technology that our founding fathers had, and their ideas that came from not wanting to be persecuted by what was then known as at that time Great Britain; but now that we as a race have essentially evolved more so from that point in history and the worlds as we now it and live in has changed. We now have the technology to commonicate with everyone around the world.   An with this we as humans and to be the highest form of intelligent life as we know right now in the universe, we all need to be acting as such. We all in nations around the world collectively share, experiment, research and debate about what we can and need to do to help one an other as a race and seeing that we are to be the highest form of intelligent life be also helping other living things on this planet be better as well.   Would I am proposing is the idea of writing the Constitution as we know it. Keeping the things that work but changing what doesn't and is holding everyone person back from achiving what ever they can think of, just as long as in doing so does not harm any other living thing or the planet we live on to the point that we have now.   In having new morals, ethics and values that can be extending and accepting of everyone no matter if they think, look, act, believe differently then any other person or living thing as long as they don't involve harming, exerminating or cause any other harm that includes physical, mental or emotional and other wise.    Once we accept everything and everyone living no matter how different they are there is no end or hinderence of what can be done as then a unified human race soul purpose in living is to help the growth and advancement of every other living thing on this planet and planets that have or will be discovered.  We all only want to live life it is fullest and that should only be dictated by what the definition of "fullilment" is; in this context by the individual. Just as long as what that intels is not effecting any other living thing in a detrimental or destructive way.   An if there is any one person or group that does choose to go aganist these new unifying morals, values and ethics. They are then governed by every other intelligent thinking living things for what they have done to go aganist what is now the new law. And thus the crime that they have committed is equal to or lesser then the harm or violence done.  Thus these people or other living things that have commited crime, one and/or they are then removed from society. Placed in a rehabilitative program until their crimes are punished and sentencing takes place. An if they are never deemed mentally able to be placed back in to society without causing harm again. They can then live out their live as prisoners do already for the crimes that they have commited.  Unto the idea of governing artfiicial life that is and can be created by other intellegence that has the means of doing so. That is what is created would also be governed by this new law, of new morals, ethics and values. Thus eliminating the fear of that new created intellegance being oppressed, feared or it not having the same opportunities that every other intellegent creature has in the world, space and the universe already.  An once the time comes that a new intelligence is created. Then the law, morals, ethics and values that now govern "living creatures" is then changed to "intellegence".  This all works cause we have the knowledge and have all as intellegent creatures have already defined what is that exists and what can an will exist in the furture. An if something that is found that has not yet been discovered it to the falls under the same laws of morality, ethics and values that governs everything elses existence.

1332	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	13	I have a flight in a few weeks on Southwest. I have a gig bag for my guitar as of now (can't really afford a super expensive hard case), and so I intend to obviously carry it on. Do most electric guitars fit in overhead bins on Southwest? I have gotten priority boarding so I should be good about getting a spot in the overhead bins. I am also worried about other flyers becoming upset with me if my guitar is stored up there and they can't put their own bags up there (I am fairly young (early 20s) and petite, so I feel I can't really "throw my weight around"). Can anyone offer me some advice on how to handle these situations? I haven't ever traveled with my guitar before. Thank you!  EDIT: Another question, since Southwest doesn't have first class, if my guitar doesn't fit in the overhead bins what happens to it?  Do they store it somewhere usually or does it have to be gate-checked at that point?   ||||| It depends on the plane! I haven't had any problems with mine, but I haven't flown Southwest in a while.   I've never had issues with other passengers being upset about the space, but if someone does comment, I'd just apologize for the inconvenience and tell them that your instrument is too important to you to risk breaking it in the cargo hold. Most airlines will check bags for free if there isn't room for them anyway, so it shouldn't be an issue.   Since you haven't flown with your guitar before, let me recommend that you loosen your strings first. Something about the altitude change can make them snap.  Good luck and enjoy your trip! ||||| Assuming you're in the US, they passed a law about this a few years ago. They have to let you bring a musical instrument in the plane if there is room. If you're in priority boarding, you should be fine: [URL] ||||| My friend often flys with electric solid-body guitars and when he does he ask the flight attendant *very nicely* if they'll put it in the flight-crew's coat closet.   It has consistently worked-out well for him, but I don't know who well this would work for a large bodied guitar. ||||| Other passengers aren't as big a concern as actually being allowed to bring your guitar on the plane in the first place.  Despite the recent laws, the decision is ultimately at the discretion of the airline, excuses like "it's a full flight" or "it won't fit in the overhead" (even if you know for a fact that it will) are more than enough to prevent you from carrying a guitar on.  Larger planes typically have a closet or two for coats, strollers, wheelchairs etc. so you can try suggesting that if you meet with resistance.  Your main goal is to avoid having your guitar go through the luggage conveyors, some planes have a "fragile" option for luggage (also used for pets) where the item is hand carried to and from the plane and stowed in a climate controlled area.  Even in this case, however, I would recommend a hard case.  It doesn't have to be a super expensive carbon fibre case or anything but no one is going to be particularly gentle with it and anything that may happen to the guitar will be considered your fault.  I wouldn't worry too much about the feelings of other passengers, travellers are usually inconsiderate jackasses who ignore carry on size limits.   ||||| For SWA, it should be an easy trip. Plan to check in right at 24 hours before your scheduled departure to ensure an early boarding group so you can get bin space. I flew SWA with my semi hollow Ibanez in a Mono case gig bag over the holidays and it fit well with lots of room to spare. Just keep a mindful eye as others are boarding and loading their stuff in the same bin so your instrument doesn't get squashed unduly. You may want to also consider loosening the strings beforehand as a safeguard. ||||| I have taken my large bodied acoustic in a gig bag on exactly twelve southwest flights. I always check in as early as possible (I.e. Set an alarm for check in time), and go towards the back where there is usually more overhead bin space. Passengers don't really care because the gig bags aren't super bulky like a case, and they have their own lives to worry about. Worst case scenario ask an attendant if they could put it in the coat closet like has already been suggested. I wouldn't feel bad telling them some story about how the instrument has sentimental value to me.  ||||| I had to fly with my classical when I was auditioning for colleges years ago.  Some flights would let you carry it on and put it up front in the coat closet (nobody ever let me try to get it in the overhead bin), but some of them made me leave the guitar at the gate so be loaded and was then unloaded when the plane landed so I could grab it at the gate.  The case got pretty banged up but the guitar survived.  It was not a flight case by any means, so if you have a more legit guitar case then you probably wouldn't have to worry about that.  Mine (at the time) was a low-end hardshell case.
7484	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	35	First off, I will say that I tend to be passive. I let people walk over me enough if I like them enough. I do things for guys I like, to show how I am into them. Perhaps, that is what gets me into trouble in the first place is that I give too much and guys take advantage of that. I recognize that.  I've been dating my boyfriend for about seven months after about a year of being friends/hooking up. He's 28, I'm 25. Apparently, I've been his longest relationship, even though he had seen some other girl for two years awhile back. He is a bit immature for his age, but can be absolutely charming and adorable. Instead of writing novella-length problems and background stories, I will just list some things that have been upsetting to me. I feel he is being manipulative with my feelings when I bring these issues up to him, and he tends to turn around and make it my fault that I'm feeling this way. I think I'm trying to find rationalization to break up with him, and what better way to find out than anonymous internet folk?  Also, I will confess that some of the things I've learned is because I checked his cell phone and logged into accounts since his password was known to me. A friend cautioned me that if I didn't trust him enough that I had to check up on him, that it's already doomed.  - One night, he met up with a young girl from his class and did not tell me. When I had asked what he did that night, he said, "not much" when he usually will tell me every inane detail of his night. I found this out by reading his texts. I have not called him out on it. I don't know what they did, or where they met up. - His coworker calls him a "snobby ass" and praises me for putting up with him - His best friend says he's a jerk and that he treats me like shit - He makes fun of said best friend and girlfriend because they call each other "baby" and "honey."  - He was drunk (like he is a few nights out of the week) the other night and grabbed my hand, jerking my arm away while I was stroking his face because I was teasingly calling him a pet name he didn't like. He did this in front of the best friend and the bf's girlfriend, the latter which got very angry about. - Whenever I call him out on stuff he does that upsets me, he'll apologize and feel that is sufficient enough, and if it isn't, then it's "unfortunate" and my issue. - When he does something he knows really upsets me, he will avoid me and not make any attempt to be genuinely apologetic. He will not talk to me until I eventually break down and do it. - He rarely, rarely will compliment me. Not like I need constant validation, but it's to a point where I'm suspicious that he wants something any rare time he says something nice about me.  - He talks down about people who are depressed/emo. I surmise it's because he was depressed for awhile, and I think he feels it's a weakness admitting to have a problem - He got furious with me for going to the couch one night, and he threatened to leave my house if I didn't tell him why I left the bed. I lied and said my roomie and his gf woke me up. He was sooo angry about it, but a few nights ago (the night he grabbed my hand away), I laid down in bed because I was really sick (and upset with how he was acting). He left without saying goodbye, and drove home drunk. If I had ever done that, you would bet there'd be hell to pay. - He made a huuuuge ordeal about confirming our relationship on Facebook because: "I hate FB, I hardly use it anyway, I should just delete my account," "I don't want certain people knowing things about me [which segued into..]" "I've had bad pictures of me tagged before, I don't want people seeing things." Sooo, our relationship = naughty pictures that must be hidden? FWIW, he finally did confirm it.. after deleting a bunch of wall posts and minimizing the amount of information shown on his main FB page. - Only within the past four or five weeks, after having to bring it up to him multiple times, will he now make genuine attempts to ensure I orgasm with sex. Before that, it was the old in-out, in-out and he'd roll over/fall asleep/go pee/turn the TV back on, leaving me unsatiated.  It's making me angry to have to write that out, and angrier that I have to find justification to dump him when I see that laid out. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of shit he's done. But I can't help but like the guy, and I don't exactly know why. There are always things about a person I am insanely attracted to, and I tend to overlook or downplay their bad sides. Because hey, everyone needs to learn and everyone has flaws. Do I need to damn them outright for that?   I feel like I have tried very hard with him. I have exerted extra, extra effort to make sure I do not ever let him think I'm a controlling or manic girlfriend, and I do a lot for him. I have bit my tongue back and resisted many a time from yelling or getting upset, simply because I know it will make him angrier. And that is probably very stupid and passive and dumb of me. I don't want to be afraid of my boyfriend. I want to know that he does care about me.   I feel I am very honest and blunt about issues, and that I lay them out in an understandable fashion for him. But he just doesn't get it. "Words are just words," I will tell him, "but your actions say so much more. You can tell me you care all you want, but when you pull shit like you do, how can you think I will believe you?" He interprets this as I'm accusing him of being mean all the time, and that he can't be Mister Charming 100% of the time. How can I relay to him that this probably isn't normal behavior? How can I make him understand? Even if I do dump him (which, unless someone can convince me otherwise, is the route I'm going to take), I want to let him know what was wrong so maybe he'll learn..  And please, if you have any advice how to advise me to not be so fucking passive and stupid and to put up with this shit.. please, be critically constructive and honest. ||||| break up with him. sorry but i cant offer any other advice than that.  ||||| I know you say 'you love him', but he does not love you. If he really wanted to be with you, he'd show the world how much he loves you. I'm sorry for putting it so bluntly, but you really do deserve better than him. Leave him, cut off all contact, and just ignore him NO MATTER WHAT. He sounds like the kind of guy who will try and emotionally manipulate you into getting back with him, but you don't want to do that. Go out, gain confidence and find a guy who cares about you and won't use you.  He sounds a lot like my ex best friend, and when I stopped talking to him, he gave me hell for a few weeks, but I just ignored it and now everyone knows how much of a dick he is. Good luck, be strong, dump him in a public place and leave quickly.  *Edit: Re-read your post, don't bother trying to tell him what was wrong for a long while at least, he'll be really bitter and angry and you'll just get upset. When you dump him say "I didn't like the way you were treating me" and leave it at that. ||||| You should not have to bite your tongue and keeps your opinions to yourself because you don't want to anger him more. That's not a good sign, it's time to get out! It doesn't sound like he does anything for you... you are the one putting up with his bs and putting forth all the effort and while yes, relationships take work and compromise, it does not all fall on one partner. Do yourself a favor and dump this loser. Find someone who appreciates you.   And don't look through your SO's messages without permission.     ||||| That's one of those things where, if you decide to do it, you need to stick to it. His best friend cautioning you says volumes... because he probably knows more than you do.  Good luck! ||||| >I let people walk over me enough if I like them enough. I do things for guys I like, to show how I am into them. Perhaps, that is what gets me into trouble in the first place is that I give too much and guys take advantage of that. I recognize that.  First, dump this guy.  You can't fix a sociopath.  "Doing things for people" shouldn't be done to show how much you're into them.  I do things for people if I feel generous, or if they perhaps need help with something ... not to manipulate them into liking me.  Second ... how are you planning to change and grow as a person so you don't end up being a doormat for the next guy, and the guy after that?  You are a prime candidate for ending up in a truly abusive relationship with someone who hits you.  Would you consider going for counseling?   ||||| He's none of those things. He's just a punk bitch. Have you tried kicking him in the teeth?  Seriously, move on. This'll never work just like Tupac Shakur will never stop releasing albums.  There are plenty of decent people out there, and you're wasting your time with this asshole. As a result of that, you deserve what you get. Remember that you're perfectly capable, and are advised to walk away. ||||| 1) Whatever you do, don't be hard on yourself.   2) You deserve basic respect and kindness, at least.   3) You have needs; everyone does. You know what those are, and it's perfectly okay for you to have them. If they're not being met, and steps are not being taken, it is perfectly fine for you to leave.   4) It's not your issued if someone else is not right for you. It doesn't make you a bad person to be honest about their bad qualities. You don't need to go handing them all the second chances you think they didn't get in life.   Sit down and make a list of all your needs and wants in a relationship. Decide which is which; decide which ones can be compromised on and which can't (a guy who makes less money than you might be fine, but a guy who can't compliment you might be a deal-breaker). Color-code it or put star stickers on it or whatever you need to do to make it clear what you will and will not tolerate in a relationship. These are your boundaries. Be clear and honest about them, and be firm. Really get to know that concrete list. If someone presents you with a deal-breaker, and you find yourself making an excuse for them, or saying, "Well, maybe he really didn't mean it; I'll let it go this one time, but if it happens again..." STOP. Get your stuff and go. If you can't extricate yourself immediately, make concrete plans to do so (save up money and start looking for your own place, line up a place to crash for a few weeks/months, etc.).   You can't change anyone; they have to do that themselves, and giving them all the opportunities and second chances in the world isn't going to make them learn to be a better person if they don't already want to.  ||||| Alright, I typed up this big thing then re-read what you wrote and deleted it all.  Let's try again.  You said be honest and constructive.  Reading this left a bitter taste in my mouth.  I think you are 100% dead on when you say your attempting to rationalize breaking up with him.  That's fine.  Whatever.  I also think your passive aggressive.  You really work yourself up quite a bit.  Read what you wrote from bottom to top & I think you'll see what I mean.  You have a considerable amount of anger built up towards him and maybe it's justified, I don't know.  I do know this, however, if you are passive-aggressive then you likely do go off on him for trivial things at a later date in lieu of confronting issues when they occur.  That drives people nuts.  You are excellent at arguing, of that there is no doubt.  You begin by pseudo-lauding him but increasingly list his faults & failures.  You've got an impressive inventory to throw in his face.  You are excellent at framing this as entirely his fault but no matter what, it takes two to tango.  You are just as culpable in this as he is.  I would be willing to bet he's as miserable with all this as you are.  Maybe he's more loyal or more lazy, it doesn't matter.  Somethings got to give.  Don't rationalize it as "I can do better" because you are proving you cannot (currently).  Maybe in the future, but not today.  You consider him immature, but from my understanding of the word I think you've demonstrated your lack of maturity (maybe him too, he didn't post).  Your not dealing with this in an "adaptive and appropriate manner" aka, you don't seem to understand that in a relationship, you both win or both lose, there is no in between.  I have been hard on you.  Maybe I missed something or maybe I'm just an arrogant jerk (been accused more than once).  I'm not trying to judge you and your probably a neat person.  So is he.  You are both good people I'm sure but this isn't working for you so do what you need to do.  So, I would recommend the tried and true advice: Cut all contact, hit the gym & move on. ||||| If he makes you unhappy, then find someone who makes you happy.  It's just that simple.  By the way, all of that crap in the movies and television and literature depicting the ideal man as a bad boy who needs to be saved is utter nonsense.  Don't waste your time.  Find an adult who is already "saved." ||||| You are not going to change him.  Even if he says he will change he will not because he knows you are passive.  Do you want the rest of your life like this, cuz seriously it's not sounding good.    So move on.... ||||| I agree with the last post, you need to break up with him. He obviously doesn't care about you, is selfish and rather inconsiderate. He seems like he has issues and the fact that his BEST FRIEND is telling those things about him really sounds like a fair warning. He seems like he needs to find help and "being macho" isn't helping at all, he is sabotaging this relationship with this attitude. Leave him and find yourself another man, one that will take care of you and make you happy. If a relationship ceases to make you happy, there is really no reason you should continue in it. I'm in that same chasm right now, minus all of the detail about yours (some small similarities, PM if you want to know the details) and am following that advise.   Best of luck, you can do it. Some people need to fix themselves. ||||| It sounds like he might be a sociopath, get rid of him. ||||| He sounds like he doesn't want a relationship, and he sounds like he's not good for you/fulfilling your needs.  Whats advice would you give a friend in this situation? ||||| > Is my boyfriend a liar/manipulator/cheater? What do I do?  Keep dating him.  He sounds like a keeper. /s ||||| Please, just break up with him. Your first step in learning about not to be passive is kicking this guy to the curb. And don't listen if he tries to turn this around on you to be your fault. Just say it isn't working for you, or he may try to manipulate you into continuing to be his doormat.  As for learning how not to be a doormat, I think you've made a good start in seeing those qualities in yourself that may need to change - the passivity and eagerness to please. These things take time. You may want to consider counseling. And look very carefully at the qualities you seek in a BF. I was much like you, long ago. And as far as BFs, I found that I had basically self destructive tendencies, in that I would pick unsuitable men, probably because of poor self esteem. ||||| I used to have a friend an awful lot like this guy. That's as much as I'm going to say, because I think he reads reddit. ||||| You are not trying to work this out. You are looking for people to validate your initial impulse to break up with him. Here is that validation. Stop reading this and break up with him. It won't get any better.  ||||| Serious question: what is a thoughtful, attentive person like you doing with an insensitive jerk like this? ||||| You aren't passive you are passive aggressive. There is a huge difference.  ||||| >First off, I will say that I tend to be passive. I let people walk over me enough if I like them enough.   >Apparently, I've been his longest relationship, even though he had seen some other girl for two years awhile back.   OK, the second is because he was looking for something like the first, so he could get away with it. Congratulations, you are the winner.   You should dump him, and apparently you know it too. You don't need to tell him anything because he won't learn. He doesn't care about you, so assume he does not respect your opinion.   Then, you need to take at the very least, a full year off of dating and get some counseling and work on your issues, so you don't do the exact same thing in your next relationship.  ||||| Break up with him. I swear, people on ask reddit ask the dumbest questions. If you know he is an asshole and is a lier, and a cheater. the question isn't what you should do. The question you should be asking is how the hell do i get out of the situation with you having the upper hand. Man people ask the dumbest questions as if they don't know the answers already. ||||| You've already figured out you need to dump him.  Good.    It is very unlikely he will learn.  The moment you dump his ass, he will decide you aren't good enough for him, that you're crazy, that you're a bitch.  Anything you tell him he won't believe.  He may believe the exact opposite.  I mean, you can give him some sort of version of this post, on the off chance that he'll keep it, and he might, in a moment of weakness, wonder if you might have had a point in 6 months....  but it's not very likely.  You have no responsibility to him, and even if you did, you probably couldn't do anything.  So deal with yourself.  You've figured out any number of the warning signs--- him lying to you, you feeling like you need to lie to him, him not being able to express love for you in words OR deeds, him not giving a fuck about you enjoying sex.....  In the future, when you START noticing something, say something immediately, and if it doesn't change... get out of it faster.  It's fine to dislike facebook, fine to get drunk once in a while, fine to have some issues......  but this wasn't one or two things, and this was a bunch of things that affected you.     If you continue to have trouble standing up for yourself... get counseling. ||||| > He was drunk (like he is a few nights out of the week) the other night and grabbed my hand, jerking my arm away while I was stroking his face because I was teasingly calling him a pet name he didn't like. He did this in front of the best friend and the bf's girlfriend, the latter which got very angry about.  I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, but it sounds like this was a fairly violent action. That is a massive red flag in my book.   > I want to let him know what was wrong so maybe he'll learn..  If you could do that then you probably wouldn't be (rightly) about to break up with him. I wouldn't bother explaining that he's a psycho, given his immaturity it would probably just make him angrier. ||||| I was the guy in this type of relationship.  Was.  We broke up after 4 years and are no longer friends.  I did a lot of soul-searching after that relationship ended and you will have the opportunity to benefit from my wisdom.   Your relationship is classic Codependent (You) - Narcissistic (Him) relationship.  Ultimately this leads to a dysfunctional, toxic relationship instead of a healthy, loving one.  The foundation of your relationship is incredibly weak and endures only because of your mutual insecurities.  It is fear-based and unsustainable.    I can tell you're entering the final stages of this relationship because you are the only one looking for help and trying to make things better while he is content to ignore that there's even a problem.  You've always been the savior, the good girl, the glue keeping everything together.  Control is very important to you and you are a master at rationalizing away inappropriate behavior by your boyfriend.   Even if you break up with him, it won't matter because you will find yourself "insanely attracted" to the same type of guy - someone who you believe makes you whole and gives your life purpose.  You've never learned to live for yourself.    You need to stop looking for that white knight to save you, stop dating altogether for at least 365 days.  It will be the most uncomfortable thing you've ever experienced.  You're used to having a man be your mirror, to provide a framework for your life.  Creating your own framework for your own life will be exceptionally frightening.  I know I'm triggering a response in you to want to argue with me, to try and point out loopholes and caveats that make your situation different and special.  But that instinct is simply a knee-jerk reaction to the fear of abandonment you've harbored inside you since you were a child.  You let yourself get trampled on because deep down you don't think you're worthy of being loved.  You feel like you have to work to earn it, and if you're not getting it it's because you aren't trying hard enough.    It is dysfunctional.  Breaking up is not enough.  You need to break your addiction of finding validation through men.    [All your life you've been a caretaker of others - now it's time for you to take care of yourself.]([URL] ||||| He sounds like a really awesome guy.  Just super genuinely kind and caring.  You're a lucky girl. Just so god damn lucky. ||||| He is very controlling and manipulative. If you do leave him (which I strongly advise), you need to cut off all contact with him. If you don't, he will try to convince you that he has changed by complimenting you or saying all of the things he should have said while you were together. No one deserves to be in a relationship like that.     You don't need to explain yourself to him or defend your decision. You need to do what is healthiest, and in this case, it is breaking up with him.    If you live alone, I would advise finding a new living situation ASAP so you aren't alone. You never know if he could turn violent. Make sure you have someone nearby for after the break up so you won't be alone. Good luck! ||||| Jesus fucking Christ.  Sorry you had to deal with such a jerk.  You were too good to someone who did not deserve it and is too immature to realize it.  Hope you're not with him anymore. ||||| he sounds like a huge, selfish asshole to me.  dump his ass.  you sound way too SWEET for him.  you need someone who will return the favor. you MIGHT love him but i get the feeling he's buying his time with you.  from now on, don't be so passive.  call his schmuck ass out whenever he commits such described douchebagory.

You could arrange for a resurrection (secure an oath from a member of a church that is known to hold such oaths sacred, and explain the situation), or use something like *contingency* to bring yourself back. If you're resigned to dying, you'd want to disband the party to keep the rezz costs down -- if that's feasible (try to find out what logic/mechanism the trap uses to determine what a "party" is). ||||| All of them, but not by myself. I would go to a bar, find someone malleable and bet them they can't open this box I have. Rinse and repeat.  ||||| At high level, I'd probably ignore the chests. I should be doing well with what I have by that point. At low level, let's go through about 5 of them. I don't want to run risks, but there's a good chance to get something better than what I have without too much chance to find something. 95% survival is good enough for me in this case. Mid game, I'd go for maybe 3. I shouldn't need too much extra, but it's nice to get more. ||||| I would open maybe 10. Once the odds of dying get any higher than 10%, that's too much for me.  EDIT: on second thought, it depends very strongly on what's in the chests.   If every chest is one roll on a table of level-appropriate loot, I'll probably be tempted to open more than 10.  If every chest could contain any level of treasure from 1 all the way to 30, I'd stop at 10 unless I didn't get anything good.  If every chest contains something stupid like a number of gold pieces between 1 and 100, then no way, I'm not opening any. ||||| Depends what's in the chests. One party member can open chests one at a time, removing treasure from the area between chests.  For each new chest, compare the total potential monetary gain with the probability of needing to pay for a Raise Dead spell. There should be an optimal number of chests to open.

4359	1,3	14	Could it be that on those "fast" days generally we are moving less through space so therefore move faster through time and vice versa? As explained in Einsteins theory of relativity. This bit of footage explains in ELI5 style. [URL] ||||| It's the amount of time spent doing nothing. On a "fast" day, you were typically doing things to fill time. On a "slow" day you weren't. It's all about how much time your brain has to notice the passage of time.  When was the last time you did absolutely nothing all day, but felt the day had flown by?  Related is the way that time seems to slow down during, e.g, a car crash. Your brain stops allowing spurious data in, and makes you focus on the immediate danger. Thus, with less external input, the brain perceives time as being slower. Someone else can probably explain it better than me.

2389	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	20	I have an old MFJ-249 (non-B) that was given to me to play around with, and I get some weird readings from my 2m antennas.  Below are my results:     My Diamond RHF40's best SWR is 1.7:1 on 150.600 mHz (2:1 at 146 mHz)     My Diamond SRH940's best SWR is 1.2:1 on 173.535 mHz (>3:1 at 146 mHz)   My Diamond SRH940 gets much better signal reports at 146 mHz, though.  So I think that either these 2m ducks don't have good SWRs to begin with, and/or my analyzer is giving bad readings.  I'm guessing the later.  For the record, the frequency counter is spot on.   Any tips on how I might get a controlled / baseline SWR reading from something to see if this thing is off?  Do you guys have any other ideas on ways to test if my SWR analyzer is giving bad readings?      ||||| With a dummy load or non inductive resistor.  ||||| SWR is not the only measurement of an antenna's performance.  A dummy load will give a perfect 1:1 SWR, but won't radiate well at all.  However, the instrumentation required to measure radiation efficiency is well beyond most ham's budgets.

The short answer is, go with what works. ||||| Use a accurate watt meter and do the math. ||||| Check with dummy load, open and short.

The other is a Diamond NR770 tuned for 145MHz which is 4:1 SWR at 159MHz. The Diamond trounces the 5/8 wave Panorama - S3 RX signal on the Panorama is S9 on the Diamond at 159MHz.  > Any tips on how I might get a controlled / baseline SWR reading from something to see if this thing is off?

1407	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	37	So a little over a month ago I met this girl on one of those subreddits for finding friends. We've talked every day since then except for like 3 days when she was injured and had to go to hospital. I mention this because for any INTP I'm pretty sure its not often we find people we enjoy talking to that much, at least I don't. We have a lot in common and frequently fill up the 10,000 character limit on reddit PMs. We discuss a lot of "deeper" topics and she has said before she respects me and my opinion which I think says a lot because I myself don't respect people easily. I'm not the best at showing interest but I've been trying here and there by offering compliments and whatnot and I think she's been receptive but I'm not positive. I think just the fact we are talking this much since we're both INTP shows we enjoy each other's company at least but I'm not sure how to tell if she is only interested in being friends or not. I don't really want to bring it up yet for fear of scaring her off. I'm not too experienced in dating, I'm in my early twenties though if it matters. I especially haven't met very many other INTPs let alone girls that I was interested in so I don't really know what I'm doing. I hope this type of post is allowed here, I'd appreciate any input you can give. Thanks. ||||| They don't. They just have fantasies in their head. If you want them you have to really force the issue, make it very clear. Subtly in this instance will not serve you well. ||||| [deleted] ||||| Not a woman, but for me, if I like someone, I go out of my way to be around them. With most people, I'll hang out if they suggest doing something, and maybe with some close friends that I don't see often I'll make the effort to make something happen like once or twice a year.  But if I'm romantically interested in someone, I end up spending as much time as possible with them, and actually putting effort into meeting up with them. If we're only friends online or texting or something, that means that unlike with most people, I'll actually start a conversation with them more than once or twice a week, and will actively try and keep the conversation going rather than just ending it when it starts to die down (or I'll just have something to talk to them about and take a really long time to run out of things to talk about). ||||| I'll point out a few things here about INTPs and internet dating.  INTPs are often uncomfortable giving and receiving compliments, especially when feelings are involved.  They may like being told nice things and actually crave them, but maybe aren't sure how to react to hearing them.  We are also very difficult to read.  In like every relationship I've ever had, the woman started with the assumption that I was not interested or hated her when I thought I was clearly showing interest.  I was talking to her after all, right?    From what you are describing, talking to anyone that much, for that long is a pretty clear sign of interest for any type.  People just don't usually do that unless they are interested.  This brings me to my next point.  INTPs move so slow in pursuing a relationship that it is almost funny.  The good news is that since she is an INTP also, she probably doesn't mind. Someone else probably would have ran off after a month of not taking things in a more romantic direction. That said, I know I appreciate someone that is more forward and direct.  She would probably appreciate the same.  Saying what we mean and the no bullshit approach is kind of our thing.    I've dated quite a few women from the internet and the biggest piece of advice I can give is to change formats ASAP.  In my experience, a relationship really takes of once you move to texting or some format like Skype or Facebook Chat.  It has to be interactive.  Long INTP narratives are great and everything, but you need to start thinking on your feet and let your Ne pour out.  Once you do that, things should progress quickly.  She would probably jump at the chance to speak freely.  I would blow through your 10,000 character limit and at the end of the second PM, ask if she would be interested in switching to a format that you could speak more naturally.  Be respectful and say that if she isn't into the idea that you still really enjoy talking to her via reddit.  Give her a few options and ask her what she is comfortable with.  Don't worry about scaring her off.  Just don't be too forward too fast and don't try to jump into a phone call first.   ||||| I think you can afford to be patient with this. You're getting on really well and having deep discussions with her, so with time you'll get to know eachother better and this will allow more time for mutual feelings to develop at a confortable pace, and should decrease the chance that she'll be scared off. It might be a mistake to talk about this stuff too soon. Perhaps after a while you could suggest adding eachother on skype and having conversations on there. I think that a natural process of growing closer over time as you get to know eachother is preferable to a sudden declaration of feelings before both parties are sure to be ready for it. ||||| Just flat out ask. Let her know it's cool if she's not interested and you're asking cause you weren't sure. If she's comfortable to speak frankly with you she'll just tell you,  or,  if she seems remotely uninterested, drop it then. ANY excuse  means no and pressing it further will cause a withdrawal. And don't ask why either. She'll have a logical reason for yes or no but might not feel ok sharing it, case she doesn't want to feel like a dick because,  at the very least,  she respects you. (Happened with an INTP with me sputtering out "but we both"s and it was just I don't care how smart you are,  I don't find you attractive)   Problem with being INTP and a woman (my experience) is that we can get so excited to talk to someone who meets us on our level and then hear they like us, and if we're not interested and if that person can move on and keep chatting we know it wasn't just because they liked us. It's an unpleasant sinking  feeling you need to be prepared to change the subject quickly. It is near impossible to tell if we friendly like you or if we like you but don't want to lose a conversation partner for fear of wigging them out. Lol.   TL;DR  Just ask her in a just checking kind of way and don't press it if she says no. No or an excuse isn't being coy, it's being nice. (next to people who treat me like I'm incapable,  not listening after a no  is my biggest peeve)  ||||| I go up to them and tell them that I'm interested in them. If they're game, awesome, if they're not, oh well, at least I found out and can move on.  ||||| just make the hints a bit more explicit, like "im starting to like you more and more", "i love chatting with you", "you are becoming really special to me" stuff like that, from what you are saying the signs are good but you met on a "finding friends" site, so theres still the chance that she is just being friendly, but take the dive man, you have nothing to lose, with time passing by she might find someone else or really putting you on the friendzone definitely cause you are not making any move. ||||| Also,  I show interest with innuendo. Then i gauge how the person reacts and go from there. It's subtle at times but there.  ||||| We don't. We might just stare at you or something. ||||| When I like someone I panic and overanalyze everything in my head without letting off any clues that might give my feelings away until I'm certain about me and the other person's feelings.   If I like someone and know I have a chance I'm likely to just go straight up and tell them. If I'm not 90% sure however I'll probably sit back a while and further analyze the situation... ||||| Well, at least now she definitely knows you're interested. ||||| I'm an INTP lady and I am usually blunt with my intentions and put myself out there. My theory is that the least he can say is no and then I won't be wondering if he likes me or not and I'll be free to move on with my life. When I first met my bf (who is very extraverted) I wanted to establish exclusivity right away.  Online relationships are hard because body language and physical chemistry are such a big part of building attraction.   My advice would be to tell her straight up how you feel. If she feels the same way then you can explore those feelings. If not then you are free to move on.  Good luck!   ||||| I used to avoid them and pretend I wasn't interested. Hoping they would show interest so I could allow myself to show a little bit of interest.  I'ven't had any romantic interests in years so I don't know what slightly more mature me would do. But I personally hate compliments, I may just say "haha thanks!" but it's just something I plainly hate from acquaintances and random people.   If you end up in a relationship try to keep the compliments at the minimum, I totally dislike how my dad is always complimenting me on bs, and it just makes me think I'm a horrible person for it, because people say "but you should be grateful!", which I never am. ||||| For me, all subtly, hints, and gameplaying go WAYYYYY over my head. Every date I've been on, every relationship I've been in, including my current relationship, has started with the guy saying, "Hey, I really like you. I know you're way too cool for me, but we should go out on a date. What do you think?" Being direct is the way to go. Possibility of ruining a good friendship? Yeah. But that's going to be true of pretty much anytime you're in this situation. Life's all about risk. ||||| Just ask, straight out. For myself, I truly can't tell whether a guy is interested in me as friends or as a legit interest unless he specifically says so or goes in for a kiss, for example. I like to pontificate and discuss regardless so hours long conversations don't necessarily mean I like you romantically.   Someone mentioned us silently fantasizing about a guy and I must say the stereotype fits. Unless I've identified definite cues, I'm not one to show my hand. I like certainty when it comes to exposing my intensely guarded feelings. I suppress them only because they're so strong, and it's exhausting to do this for the wrong person.  ||||| An intp giving you any attention is a form of romantic interest. The more attention they give you, the less attention they give to thinking.. that's a big sign, at least for me.. because even when I am with people that may think I'm into them, I can easily not be there and be in my head, giving minimum socially.   Intp, we are direct. The hot/cold comes from us wanting independence vs wanting affection, it's an internal tug of war.. many times I've had a gf and the next day had thoughts of wanting out already.. Interacted with people - even seeking them out, then want little to do with them afterwards. So balance time with them and time away from them, if you do this well, we will think about you a lot.   So be direct. Very direct. Then just chill, if they give you any attention, you're already in. We're really open books and vulnerable. Very easy to win if you know what you are doing.   Also, maybe I am alone here but I do test a lot. Like won't be affectionate even if I like you.. and can easily slip out of emotional, sentimental moments. I don't really know what the question was,  I just like to talk about myself ||||| Hey, don't let that inferior Fe tell you that you shouldn't express your feelings at this point. There has been an establishment of a relationship that exceeds "aquantiance" status. Tell her how you're feeling.  ||||| Agree with everyone who says they just say it outright. I don't think anyone I've ever been involved with in any way has had to question my interest. I met current bf in a bar, we had an awkward goodbye, but as soon as I got to my car I regretted it, found him on Facebook and just hit him with a "hey, I like you."  Edit: I think the deal is that most people are so uninteresting to me that I find someone I connect with, I'm gonna put it out there. I think the fact that you guys have been talking so much bodes well ||||| I just tell them. To be fair, this is a situation I've been in exactly twice, but that's what I did. I realize I like said person --> I tell the person I like them.  ||||| I'm not sure how I've expressed romantic interest on the outside. When I was in middle school, I came on too strong. And then as I learned my lessons and grew older, I became more and more withdrawn. I realized that my romantic feelings were based on high respect and esteem for another individual rather than just looks. I often came to the conclusion that it wasn't necessary for me to act on those feelings because I was happy enough about thinking kindly of others. I didn't really feel the need for them to express kind feelings or romantic sentiment towards me. I thought that would be selfish of me to beckon for someone's affection.  It was much easier to be romantically receptive to others if they expressed interest in me first. As I grew older, I gave guys more of a chance and I could normally find things that I deeply admired about them.

7536	1,3,3	4	So the title might be a little bit misleading, but I have a hard time not freaking out after having sex with him. I am on the IUD and we do use condoms but sometimes we will have sex without one for a minute or so before putting one one. Anyways, I have such a hard time not being paranoid after having sex. I'm always worried he might have cummed in me when he always tells me he didn't. Lately, my anxiety has been a lot worse because I been having trouble with my IUD because it has been moving around. I did have an ultrasound about two month ago and the doctor said everything was in place but I still am freaking out. However, I just don't trust my boyfriend. I mean I do but I don't at the same time. I'm terrified he's going to get me pregnant even though I am on birth control. He did tell me he did get his last girlfriend pregnant but she didn't carry through. And, that just adds on to my worry because he did mange to get someone pregnant and I'm terrified of getting pregnant. I also don't really know how to bring this up because he says he's not too worried because I have an IUD and we do use condoms and he also pulls out too. So, he feels like we are protected enough but I'm still worried.       **tl;dr**: I'm terrified of getting pregnant but I don't know how to talk to my boyfriend about it because he feels like he's doing enough on his part. ||||| Not an expert in this, but I assume maybe grab a handful of pregnancy tests and have one on a regular basis.  ||||| There's always a risk of pregnancy when having sex. If your that anxious about it why not stick to only anal sex? Either that or see a counselor about addressing your anxiety. 
2361	1,3	4	Hi everyone,  this week, I have been judging the Epica Awards. It's an ad awards show where the judges are picked among journalists. I have been asked, as an advertising blogger, to join for the pre-selection jury.  Here is my experience looking at more than 3500 entries from all over the world in five days.  We were asked to judge the idea (and not the results) except for the technique categories (cinematography, direction, animation, illustration, photography, special effects, graphic design, editing, sound design, use of music).   First thing first, I would like to tip my hat off to the creative people. I have a huge respect for what you guys do. Indeed, it is not easy to create something and send it out to be judged without mercy.  Anyway, I would also live to give a bit of advice to anyone who enters work at an ad awards show and wants to actually win something. Please: - shorten your case study video - write bigger on your board (think of it as Powerpoint slide) - don't enter your work as a campaign if only one piece can do the trick  - don't enter your work as singles if they don't work alone - don't enter your work as singles and as a campaign (unless you want to piss off the jury) - don't send work that has absolutely no chance of winning (you will do yourself a favor and will save money) - target better the type of competition you want to enter (some judge the idea, some judge the effectiveness) - don’t over-enter your work in too many categories - explain in the description why your work belongs in the entered section  This was my first time judging and I really liked it. I hope that they will ask me again next year. What I've observed is that: - categories are becoming more and more useless (to be honest, they are films, print, radio and all the rest seems really blurry) - the radio category is definitely the hardest to judge (note to creatives: why not try to pimp your audio submission with visuals, a la Youtube lyrics videos ?) - regarding the case study videos, let me get it straight: they are super boring. Everyone use the same format (brief, challenge, idea, execution, results). Don't do that. Instead, try to communicate in a few words your main takeaway and how you want people to talk about your idea in just a sentence. The video should be self-explanatory.  Example of a good case study video: [URL]  Example of a bad case study video: [URL] ||||| As someone who worked as the guy preparing case study videos I can tell you this. Most creatives don't care that much about the case study video*. They have to squeeze it in between all their other actual ad work so it's not a priority. They also don't write the entries. Usually there is an employee who manages all the awards entries for an office.   * Except for CCO's and young teams that need to get the name out there.

9229	1,3,3,3,3	8	It makes landfall on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.  Can the militaries of the world defeat it?  If so, what are the casualties? ||||| No, not really.  Void Shields and armour that makes most bunkers look like a eight-year old's treehouse.  It "dies" when its crew run out of supplies, and not before. Nothing on our world could power it for any amount of time, certainly nothing easily scavangable. Plus I'm not sure how it'd ever leave the America's/Mexico/Canada. ||||| [Imperator Class Titan]([URL]  An Imperator would be out of sorts without an escort of warhounds and warlords, but would do relatively well on its own.  I'm going to assume the US government's first response isn't "nuke it" and tries to assemble a force to deal with it.  In that time it could easily destroy, say, New York city, killing thousands; the heat from a Plasma Annihilator charge is enough to melt unarmored people at a good distance.  It's void shields and armor are incredibly strong but will eventually fall if attacked constantly, of course getting it's shield down isn't instant death.  In [The Battle of Helsreach]([URL] an army of Orks rigged a couple of hab spires (skyscrapers) to explode and fall on an Imperator and the plan  succeeded in making it take a knee, but not much else.  Overall loses would be terrible, but we would certainly be able to defeat it with constant attacks once we realized the sort of threat it posed, although even if we didn't defeat it there's no way it would be able to move itself fast enough. ||||| Nuke. 7-15% of US population. ||||| There was a post on a 40k forum I used to frequent that was similar to this. I'll see if I can find a link, but no promises.  I think they could. The Imperator does not to my knowledge have any anti-air defenses with enough range to combat modern combat aircraft. A combined salvo of enough AGMs would potentially be able to overwhelm the void shields and cause damage.   The largest Titans are really only useful against other massive targets. This is comparable to a single man with a .50 rifle against a swarm of Wasps and Ants. His weapon will kill anything it hits, but it would be more efficient to just step on them. You'll kill thousands either way, but you won't kill as many as a much smaller, more varied force.  It would kill <1% of the Earth's population, *if* the US military acted optimally, and launched a joint strike with every available aircraft. 
9102	1,1,3,3,3,2	12	I got immensely excited when I came across a copy of WU LYF in the new arrivals section at my local record store.  And it was only $50.  I was sold.  I couldn't wait to get it, take it home, and put it on.  I started thinking how insane it was that they were selling it for only $50, when it lists for at least $100 on Discogs, and my local record store is usually pretty savvy about their pricing.  So I pulled it out to look it at it.  There was a huge gash on side A.  My joy quickly turned to ashes in my mouth, even though I did stand there for a while, looking at it, and trying to talk myself into it anyway.  But I didn't.  I re-sleeved it, put it back, and walked away.  I don't know if it will help ease the pain, but it would be nice to hear if any of you have similar stories. ||||| I have a copy of that myself, with a nasty scratch over the first 15 seconds of track one. So maybe its an epidemic. Great record though.  ||||| Huh, I bought that new for like $17 when it first came out... if it's the one I'm thinking of.  ||||| I had a pristine copy I sold for $30 when I was short on money. I'm okay.... :') ||||| Well I'll be damned. I haven't played my copy in years, but I remember it being a pretty sweet album.

I'll have to check when I get home. ||||| Does anyone know why it's so expensive now? Is it just rare?

5667	1,2,3,3	7	What is a good suggested multi tool? I am looking for a good multi that stands up to wear and tear well. I have a gerber currently that I take out into the field with me.  It is the model with pliers that slides out. I like it but it feels kind of rickety. ||||| There is a reason that the Leatherman brand is the industry standard.   What do you want the tool for? There are literally hundreds of size/configuration options and just as many attachments. Do you want a lightweight tool for weekend backpacking trips or do you want a beefy monster that you can keep in in your gear bag when you go on that 3 week hunting trip to upper British Columbia? ||||| Sorry for being so late, I was searching for information and found your topic! Might this information be put to good use, if it's not too late :)  I currently own 2 generations of Leatherman Wave and a brand new SOG PowerAssist. One major asset of the SOG is that you can change tools by yourself. Leatherman don't let you do that. Also, **when cutting cables**, your pliers don't get stuck. It happened to me so many times with my Wave, I needed to pry open the pliers of the Wave because I cut something hard. The pliers simply rock. They have so much power !!! You will like them for sure. The 1/4 driver is an ultra most as well as the scissors. You prolly have enough 1/4 bits to last a lifetime already so why not putting them to good use.  Biggest downside, you can't fold the pliers and use the knife unfolded (like a long screwdriver) or 90° if you need more power. Second problem is the can opener, which sucks balls. They didn't try it themselves. The last notable downside is having the serrated blade on the same side. Left handed people will use the serrated blade, right handed people will use the straight blade more often. Closing the blades with one hand isn't as easy as the Wave.  The best tool of the Wave is the thin bit set. Being able to switch from phillips to flat in a second was a must. I broke plumbing collars because I was tighting them too hard with the multiple bit tool. No wonder why I broke the flat screwdriver also :P I must say, I really love both of them. I prefer the PowerAssist because it's bigger, blades are assisted, the pliers rock.  Hope this might have helped a bit ! :) ||||| The Gerbers with fixed or pivot-handle pliers are much more solid.  I've been using a Legend 800 for EDC for a decade now.

6289	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	[deleted] ||||| LQ are the fastest way to level in this game  If you have credits i recommend getting a full 5 player party and rerolling only MM LQ.               As for splinters they drop the same everywhere provided you are killing stuff, people point to midtown because it has a high mob density, so you are always killing stuff and things are being killed around you. ||||| What shogun said.  Concerning Heroes, Juggs is pretty much a top Tier Hero, you won't find much stronger than him. Cap is rather meh, Wolf is fine as well, i did not like Ms Marvel too much.  Especially as a new player, you have to do legendary quests, as you need the odin marks from the quests for legendaries and blessings. ||||| Most versatile hero is probably rogue. I loved Silver Surfer as well. If you don't mind a large download you can get the test server and check out all the heroes at lvl 60.  Eternity splinters only drop if you are killing mobs around your level. If you notice they drop more in MM that's because there the mobs are always near your level. If you go to story mode for instance you can end up playing mobs much lower lvl, and you will get no drops from those.  Legendary quests are great, but some of them take a long time, particularly story mode ones where you have to locate things scattered across the map. Re-rolling is a great option to keep the legendary quest on content you are doing anyway (midtown for instance), but the costs can be significant if you are a new player. ||||| If you really wanted to for Eternity Splinters you could go out and get one and then go back to town.  Start a timer for 6 to 8 min and then go back out and kill until you get another.  It's not bad to do if you are semi afk or doing some other work on the pc. ||||| The BEST way to level in the game is to wait until the last two days of an OMEGA event when XP is boosted to 168 & 192% (somtimes it goes over 200%).  But short of that, Legendary Quests is the best way.  YOu can start doing those at level 20.  Also don't forget to get these boosts: -Find a costume core/bind it to your costume at the crafter with +int   -When you unlock Heroic difficulty, go to Upper East Side , find the construction site and enter the underground to fight Mole Man.  Equip his medal, ideally you want one with +2 INT.     -When you are able to, use your Omega Orbs on the omega tree that  award you extra XP like the Stark Tech node.   -Equip slot 1-5 gear that gives +xp for kills.  While leveling it doesn't really matter what you're using too much, so favor +xp stuff.  You can find tune your build properly once you hit 60.   Ms.Marvel is a good mix of survivability and DPS but she's not the best at either one.  WOlverine packs a punch, he's really good right now.  Captain america as i understand it is not very good right now.    Juggs is very good for DPS and Survivability.  Rogue is the top DPS in the game with the right  stolen powers.   Eternity Splinters drop as you kill stuff, they won't drop any sooner than 8 minutes since the last one.  YOu have to be killing stuff for them to drop, they don't drop more or less in any zone really.  The key is you need to be playing zone content appropriate for your level.   If you're over-leveled for a zone you won't get hardly any drops, no uniques, no relics, no runes, no shards.  But yes there are people who use ES boost potions that zone into midtown, get an ES, then zone out to ahub and wait for 8 minutes (since the timers stop in hubs) then zone back into midtown and get another ES and zone out.  It's really boring to play that way but you can do it.   ||||| I also recommend LQs, and yeah, stay away from story mode when you need to find "treasure rooms", just takes too long, and you can do many others much faster for the same amount of xp.  Doing Legendary quests give you a lot of exp and you get an odin mark per finished quest. For 300 marks you can get a legendary weapon, which help quite a lot on a hero. Or for 100 marks you can bless artifacts with stat boosters.  I'd also recommend to reserve every Monday for MH, as the Monday Midtown Madness has bosses dropping crates of about 150k-170k xp. About 3-4 bosses per 3.5 mins, you get almost 600k every 3 mins, which works well for leveling. Got my Gambit from 1-43 yesterday before I got a bit tired.  There is a mission in the story mode that gives you a 50% xp booster (I think it's chapter 7) after finishing it, and if you finish it on normal, heroic and superheroic mode you'll have 3 of them. They will of course help in all leveling. ||||| LQ are the fastest way to level and have the added bonus of netting you credits and odin marks as well.  The way I level personally is doing X-defense levels 1-20 and then bumrushing the legendary quests. You want most of the terminal and midtown quests that pop up. Industry City is usually fine and some of the story ones aren't too bad. As you do the quests you should make mental note of how it's going so you know which ones you would rather just skip as you build credits leveling your characters. The more of them you do the better and faster you'll be at power leveling new characters.  Heroes are differently strong in a lot of ways. I would say to just play who you like. Especially early on, just focus on enjoying yourself playing. Doctor Strange is considered to be a very strong hero but I personally can't really get down with his playstyle and I prefer playing other heroes over him. It's not all about what's strong. If anything go with characters you already have interest in, and from there find playstyles (melee, ranged, tank, etc.) that you enjoy.  With splinters, some people argue the timer but it sure feels like 8 minutes to me. As long as you're killing stuff you're going to see them. It feels like they drop more frequently in midtown because stuff is dying everywhere so there's not really downtime of walking around looking for things like there may be in other zones.
1658	1,3,3	5	Seems like there aren't a lot of cases for this phone and almost none with button cutouts. I've so far found only two:      [URL]   I don't like the cruzer bugdroid on the back though.  [URL]   Looks nice except it doesn't cover the bottom or top so not enough protection in my opinion.      Has anyone come across any other cases with uncovered buttons? I wish I could find a simple tpu case with the cutouts but every one I look at has covers.   Have these improved in the past couple of years? The last time I used a case with button covers was like 2-3 years ago and it was so annoying that I ended up cutting them out with a razor which was better but didn't look so hot. I think those were silicon. ||||| i have [this one]([URL] and it has the cutouts, but might not offer the kind of protection you're looking for. but i have dropped it a couple times with absolutely no damage, so there's that ||||| Just found this one on ebay:  [URL]  Looks like it goes all the way around.
7402	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	39	Yes he is still young but he's been very underwhelming so far.  ||||| I am reserving my judgement on all the players that we bought in recent years until I see them play under another manager. Even Mata and Fellaini. ||||| He can make stupid mistakes sometimes (like the diving header against Stoke) but tbf he's 21 and he's got so many years to improve his game.    I think people are wrong to say Depay is a flop, he's awful etc because he's in a completely new environment and he's incredibly young. ||||| I definitely didn't think he should have been substituted today, there were worse players than him and we were losing 2-0 at the time.  ||||| Obviously he made a very bad play. It was so stupid. But he played well after that and he's been playing well the last 3-4 weeks. He is not Arjen Robben but he is only 20 and has lots to learn.       Looking forward to big things from him in the future. ||||| I want so bad for him to be great and be Ronaldo for the next 10 years and never leave.  ||||| He needs a full back that will overlap him. Simple as that. ||||| He's still young and needs time, but the work rate needs to be stepped up a notch. ||||| Young, first season in a new league, playing in a restrictive system that almost all our players are struggling in, especially our attacking creative types and very especially our wide players who don't have any overlapping fullbacks to free up our wingers and let hem go do shit or take on players 1v1.   Every team pushes  their fullback up to create 1v1s where the wide men can flourish. What can depay do if he is 2v1 and tracking back cause their fullback is overlapping all game. ...    So you can't really judge him too much.  He's been very average thus far but the above really makes it hard to tell.  ||||| Yes he has been but who hasn't (smalling, martial)? It just seems like the players had enough of LVG just like how the chelsea players had enough of Mourinho. They're showing zero passion zero desire it's fucking sad to watch. ||||| Went for a walk after the game to uncloud my judgement, he needs time (and possibly a new manager) ||||| I'm not worried, he's young and the talent is there. All we need from him this season is to acclimate to the league and then next year, push on. ||||| Obviously a very talented player, but when he's 1v1 on the left wing, it's so blatantly obvious that he's going to try and cut inside. He seems to lack the confidence to whip in a cross on his left foot at the moment, which is frustrating because he definitely has the ability. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times he's successfully cut inside this season, he's far too predictable and easy to defend against.   I think the entire team is lacking confidence. I believe that, unfortunately, it can only be solved by replacing the manager. ||||| He struggled in the beginning, but weirdly, I think since we've been struggling he's actually played better. Like he's trying to prove himself. A good sign in my opinion. I'm very optimistic about him.  ||||| This season he's been shocking. But i don't think he warranted being taken off early today. He was ok apart from that one fuck up. Bringing on Rooney seemed to improve us. But there would've been a much bigger improvement if Rooney came on for Fellaini instead of Memphis.   Memphis was no where near our worst player. Mata had another shocker. Herrera too. I wouldn't say Memphis was good but I'd never single him out either. Idk what LVG was thinking leaving Fellaini on ||||| My thoughts are he is a good player, with high expectations going through a tough transition. Also, he has yet to be played in his natural position making the transition even tougher.  If Memphis was an academy player he would be forgiven for his transgressions. People forget how young Memphis is because of his accomplishments so far. ||||| The problem in the Premier League is that he doesn't get the space to dribble with the ball. So he always runs into the oppoment and then loses the ball. If he learns to dribble past a player he can be the next big thing.
5499	1,3,3	15	So my phone slid off my bed and got caught between the bedframe and box-spring and got chipped in several areas. It's also been chipped from being bumped around in my pocket at work (before I got a case for it). Does anyone know if Apple can replace the body of the phone, without having to do a full replacement? I'm more than capable of paying for a repair like that if it's something that can be done in-store. Or should I just use my phone insurance and pay the $165 deductible and get it replaced that way?  I'm pretty picky about my electronics, and especially my phone, since I paid so much for it just 3 months ago and it's already gotten chipped in the weirdest spots ever.

2217	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	40	I am a sixteen year old working at a fun park center/arcade and I decided to quit my job a couple weeks ago. I did this because I wanted to get a job in food service and I felt that I wasn't getting enough hours. I requested a two week notice form from my manager, and my coworker, (who I will refer to as M), and a few others were present.   My manager told me that he would just remove me from our staff list and that since I wasn't scheduled for the next two weeks, tonight could just be my last shift. I agreed to that and clocked in. Now, M and I don't really know each other and I have noticed that he has been staring at me recently. He also has followed me around once or twice. I thought this was weird at the time but I wrote it off as him just being kind of socially awkward and lonely, maybe even having a little crush. I didn't know how old he was, just that he was older than most of the teenagers working here. I've been friendly towards him just to be polite, and we've only really talked two to three times.   But tonight, he starts following me around everywhere I go. I end up having to duck into the women's bathroom just to get away from him. Wherever I go, he follows. He doesn't say anything, and I get very freaked out. I finally have enough and quickly rush into the break room. He follows me in there, and we are the only ones there. M just stares at me, and I notice him reach down and begin rubbing his crotch through his pants, all without breaking eye contact. I become scared and get out of there as fast as I can.   I go back to where I was working and think that maybe I was just overreacting, that he was just trying to adjust himself or something. But finally, when closing time came I went into a supply closet to get some disinfectant, he came in and just stood there in the doorway. He just watched me, and I was too paralyzed with fear to do anything. M didn't let me leave, he didn't say anything, and finally after a few moments he turned around and left. For a moment, I felt like he was going to try and attack me. I panicked and and ran to the women's bathroom, where I hid until my shift was over.  When I clocked out, I asked my other manager, P, to talk privately. I told him everything and said asked for the matter to be kept between us. I didn't want to cause any trouble, but I was so shaken up that I began to cry. He told me that they have had many problems with M and that he has done things like these before and that he still hasn't gotten the message that it isn't okay. P apologized profusely saying that he would have to talk to another one of the managers about the situation, and if that was alright. He said my name wouldn't be mentioned at all, and that it wouldn't happen again, so I said yes and thanked him. P told me that if he ever does anything outside work or if I need anything, that I could call him.  When I left his office, several of my coworkers, including M, were waiting. I thought he had left already so I tried to avoid looking at him. I just sat in my chair, looking at the ground. He gathered his stuff and stormed out, and one of my coworkers wondered what he was so mad about. I became so nervous that when all of them left I began to sob. I didn't want to go out to car in fear that he would be there. I had someone walk me to my car and I turned on the lights inside and searched the seats.  I drove home in tears, teeth chattering and body shaking. I almost had a panic attack and crashed my car.   I told my sister and my mom, but I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. A part of me feels like I'm overreacting about this whole thing, that maybe he's harmless and all the stuff that happened were just coincidences, that he was just an awkward man who didn't know what he was doing. I'm still shaking just writing this, but I feel like I need to get this off my chest. I don't know if I should talk to anyone else or try and move on.   TL;DR: 16 year old is harassed by an adult coworker on last day of job, followed by him all night, got me alone and rubbed his crotch while staring and cornered me in a supply closet. Didn't do anything, but still shaken. Has been told that he has had similar problems in the past by manager, he promised to take care of it. Went home and told mom and sister. I feel dirty and confused by the whole thing, dont know how to move forward.  Update: I want to thank you all so much for your kindness and support, I had no idea I would get this many responses, and I'm grateful for all your help. I wanted to specify that I live in Utah, so I don't really know the laws regarding harassment against minors in this state. I want to tell the police somehow but I'm scared that I'll have to go to court or have him arrested. I also told P that I wasn't going to do anything about the incident, but now I'm scared of him doing the same thing to someone else. But I am going to go see my school counselor Monday so that I can talk to someone else about the experience. Also, I just talked to my friend and coworker, L, and she said that he asked her out one time even though he was over 18, and she was a minor. ||||| You work at an arcade/fun park? So this guy is around children/teenagers all day? Yikes. And management knows about this and sweeps it under the rug? If you told the press, no parent would take their kids there again. It would serve them right for putting kids/you at risk.  I understand he needs to work, but he needs to be somewhere where he can't harass anyone.   ||||| Honestly, I would follow up with the workplace to see what action they are taking and let them know I also planned to file a report with the local police. You do not have to be "pressing charges" to have the police do a report. Insist they take a report and get the case #, and ask them for follow up.   They will talk to him directly, and he will be on their radar, and the next woman will be believed- when they often are not.  There's already a pattern of behavior there and that workplace has been enabling him and it's really not safe to be leaving him alone with teenaged girls.  I don't think you're off base thinking there was a chance he would attack you- he doesn't seem to know how to stay within bounds, following you around and masurbating? Fuck that. Report him. And let them know your what your manager said about his history.  That shit is messed up.  ||||| If you can find the time (and you really should), pick up Gavin DeBecker's [The Gift of Fear]([URL] The feeling of agitation you felt served you well. By reading this book, it will help you realize that you aren't wrong to feel this way and you'll know how to better react if you find yourself in such a situation in the future.

That aside, your feeling of shame may be understandable but you don't need to feel that way. You've done absolutely nothing wrong. ||||| I just wanted to say something, which I know might not be the point most people take from this, but I was incensed by this part.  > He told me that they have had many problems with M and that he has done things like these before and that he still hasn't gotten the message that it isn't okay. P apologized profusely saying that he would have to talk to another one of the managers about the situation, and if that was alright.  This is NOT alright. They've had *many problems* and he still hasn't "gotten the message"? He needs to be fired. Immediately. This man is not fit to be near women (or, I suspect, people in general) and retaining him as a staff member at the expense of the safety and security of female staff is a complete disgrace. ||||| Unfortunately, gross/creepy men often seem to target teenage girls, possibly because they know they are often vulnerable, young, and not confident enough to confront them directly (which is fair enough).  I'm a few years older than you and I know what it's like to be in your situation. While this may not be much of a comfort, you will be able to deal with this better as you get older. For now, just know that you did exactly what most 16-year-old girls would do in that situation, I know I've done that before. Remember that HE is the one in the wrong, not you. It's completely understandable why you acted the way you did, it's normal, and it's ok. It's NOT a reflection on you or your character.  EDIT: Omg first reddit gold!! I'm so excited! Thank you so much :) ||||| [deleted] ||||| Always trust your instincts. That little voice inside you & that panicked feeling will keep you safe throughout your life. Never ignore those feelings for any reason, ESPECIALLY because you don't want to feel stupid or make the person to feel badly. They count on the fact that you will feel embarrassed & will be nice about it. Just think about all that he's done so far! Things will escalate to physical assault if left unchecked. All of these incidents you mentioned were him trying to see what you'd do or not do in different scenarios. So far, you allowed him to corner you TWICE and rub his crotch at you *without you screaming or yelling at him to stop*. He can only conclude that if he does worse, you will have the same reaction: do nothing / allow it. Trust your instincts in this case and every case in the future. Get away from him & report it to the authorities.  EDIT: added the italicized part to help alleviate confusion ||||| This is not your imagination.  This is not coincidence.  Chances are if you do nothing his behavior will escalate.  Maybe not with you, but someone you may never meet.  Report this.  I also suggest you seek some counselling to get beyond this traumatic experience.  None of this is your fault, but if you do not act someone else may suffer. Don't let that happen. ||||| Call the police, because if hes done this once he'll do this again.   You did nothing wrong, he chose to be disgusting, he picked on a young girl because he doesn't think you'll do anything. As you get older, you get more defiant about creeps and put them in their place. For now though, you've not much experience.   Definitely go to the police, tell them what happened. If this has happened before, you're just adding to a paper trail, ofc its his word vs yours, but that way if it happens again, hes going to get caught.   You deserve to feel safe. He violated that, hes scummy.  ||||| Late to the thread but I want to give my two cents.   None of this is your fault. Nothing to be ashamed of and definitely nothing to be quiet about.   Your manager isn't looking out for you, he's practising damage control. You've experienced sexual misconduct in the work place, and if this is a common theme with the same member of staff then this is a cat that really needs to be let out of the bag.   This man works with other children ( I don't mean to be patronising, but at 16 you're just not an adult).   I'm glad you are no longer employed there however I would definitely take this further.   Best of luck to you.  ||||| Your feelings are understandable. But you didn't do anything wrong. Your sister and mom are probably not experienced in handling these situations. It didn't mean they didn't care. I would try to talk to someone, like a counselor at your school, who is more likely to understand what you're going through. Also, your sister and your mom may have difficulty trying to empathize with your pain and distress because it might bring them guilt and a sense of powerlessness when they try to empathize with you too much. So at times, it's best to talk to a third-party professional that you can trust; a school counselor (even if you don't go to school), you should be able to call  her up (I'd advise a female counselor if possible) and explain what's going on. ||||| I predict that this guy is going to hurt someone some day. I'm glad he didn't hurt you. Don't feel embarrassed about being scared. Your fear might be what saved you, no one else stepped up.  ||||| Oh. My. Gosh. I'm kind of speechless shocked right now.  I'm really sorry you had to experience this, honestly. I'm only 17 myself and male, but I am horrified by what is happening nowadays. This reminds me of Amanda Todd- older men bullying or intimidating teenage girls. Everytime I hear something like this, it's like I need to throw up just to purge it out. You should know that you are in no way responsible for what happened. He is the one who has been offending you- albeit not openly. You have acted exactly the way I would have recommended it had you asked me; letting your superiors deal with him is not a sign of weakness, but evidence you have more situational awareness than many.  Thumbs-up for doing what was right, and not taking the easy way out by not informing your superiors of his behavior. You may have saved others from his advances. ||||| Report to police & HR... Both of these are absolutely imperative!  If M has done this to you then he likely has done this to other co-workers and potentially the children who attend the park.  P and the park doesn't want the publicity because a potential pedophile employee would be very bad for business.  Before going down this road, it was good advice to arrange your support network... Mother/sister/friends... It will be hard to do but it's critical. ||||| XY here  " I feel so embarrassed and ashamed" It is his fault, he should be embarrassed not you.  "A part of me feels like I'm overreacting about this whole thing" You did the perfect thing. Overreacting would be if you shot and killed him, you went and talked to the manager and it is his job ensure that your workplace is safe for every one to work.  "that he was just an awkward man who didn't know what he was doing" Let me give you an analogy, if I take a gun into a bank, I could be a harmless person who didn't know what I was doing, I have good intentions or I am a robber. But there is always a chance that I am a robber and the bank security is not going to wait and think "oh hey, he might be just carrying around a gun because he is an awkward person", they are going to think this guy is a risk and he needs to be dealt with and that is exactly what you did, that is exactly what your emotional response was, and it was right, don't try to cover that emotional response or say that it was invalid, it is a perfectly valid emotion and you have every right to feel threatened by what he did. ||||| I don't want to sound condescending, I would say this to any woman of any age:  I am SO proud of you for going to your manager. That took a lot of bravery, and telling your family so that they are aware of the situation and what you are going through. You have nothing to be ashamed of! You didn't do anything wrong. Some men know how to scare women like this. It's awful.   You have every right to feel violated and scared. Even if "nothing" happened. He was acting extremely inappropriately, stalking you around work. You are not over reacting. You are reacting completely perfect to a situation and you went through the motions to keep yourself and other girls safe.  I'm so proud of you!! You should treat yourself extra nice today. And it's okay if it takes a moment to shake off the creeper vibe.  
3682	1,3,3,3	7	Hey guys! I am going to my very first convention, Mechacon (in NOLA), in August! After a bit of thought, I have decided to go as Zelda:   [URL]  It seemed simple enough and thought it would be a good idea for a first try at cosplay! I think I am going to try and make her dress, but I can't sew! Is a project like this a good way to learn? Hah.. I do have an aunt to help out, but I mostly want to try and make it myself! I have a pattern picked out and a wig lined up to buy, and I am optimistic that it will turn out nicely! :)  Wig: [URL] It might be a bit off color than the picture I posted, but in the game it is a bit more golden than that artwork! I will style it myself! And I am thinking of using ribbon in her hair, or making foam pieces.    Another problem I may face, is that I wear glasses. I am going to try and get a pair of contacts so that I don't have to wear my glasses while I'm dressed up. But, if that isn't an option, would it be that big of a deal? :\ I would just hate for everything to turn out well, and then it be ruined by that! lol  Also, any general advice you guys could give me about being Zelda or about materials or how to have fun at the con or anything at all, that would be great! Thanks! ||||| A small tip: When you're styling your wig, make sure you make upward cuts in the bangs rather than just cutting straight across. A lot of new cosplayers make this mistake and it's easy to avoid, even if it takes a little more time.  For your glasses - occasionally my boyfriend can't find the right contacts, so he just makes sure to take his glasses off for pictures and wears them around the con otherwise. It's not the best solution but it works for him, and it would probably work for you too. ||||| That looks like a wonderful pick for a first sewing project! Patterns are pretty simple to follow - usually the biggest learning hurdle for sewing is figuring out how to thread the machine, and how to trouble shoot basic problems like thread tension. What pattern are you using?  ||||| This is the pattern: [URL]  It isn't loading up on my browser for some reason, so I hope it loads for you! I do have some help to guide me along the way, so hopefully it won't be too stressful! I picked this specific Zelda because of the simplicity of it, haha! Though it also makes me feel like I must get every detail perfect!
2978	1,3,0,3	4	Calling Cards are purely cosmetic, and there's A LOT OF them in the Black Market's pool. I figure it wouldn't harm Activision's precious COD Points sales, because they do not advertise Calling Cards, as well as the fact that they were there before COD Points was introduced.    I know *many* people still have an insane desire for the "Perk-a-Colas" Rare Calling Card from the WAW set.  I have it and dont desire it. I'd even accept a common for it. It would be easily achieved through this way. It's also not as radical as, say, a weapon trading system, which is something COD shouldn't fathom at this point. ||||| They wont make any profit from that,  sadly,  so don't get your hopes up  ||||| This is not Pokemon ||||| Introducing this after I've burned all of my duplicate calling cards would make me mildly mad.

I've had this outfit for a while now, still can't figure out how to change the top. But when selecting player owned outfits in heists or adversaries, sometimes a random logo appears over the bikini. I'm trying to figure out how to save this. Maybe through a versus or something, I'll let you know if I find something. ||||| Where's the result image??? ||||| Well you can't exactly change the shirt but the alt method of getting a dress then going to shoes and choosing boots will give you a grey tank top instead ;)  ||||| [removed] ||||| [deleted] ||||| Also confirmed on X1. ||||| Lol.

8188	1,3,3,3	9	 I have this friend who is very dear to me and he started smoking and i'm very concerned. We are young he started two weeks ago I think and I really want him to stop because, in my opinion it's not good for him, just an addiction it wont bring him happiness. i'm amazed he even started because he was always 100% against it, he even said once he never understood why people smoke. i haven't even tried yet to convince him to stop, what should i tell him? i don't know if i should be a little harsh or not, because i still have to respect his choice no matter what and i don't want to hurt his feelings. he said he was going to stop but i really don't know, I've seen a lot of people saying that and then re-starting again. The only person i know it stopped smoking completely is my dad but that's because i was 6 years old and i convinced him to stop, i think he did because he saw it as a bad example.  I'm scared too because he might do something else that may harm him and i don't want that to happen.  I'm sad and angry because this really hurts me, to see someone you care going this path. he may not feel much about it but it hurts those around who care for him  I need advice please and i wont stop trying to convince him to stop amoking, unless he tells me hes happy that way ||||| You can't, he has to want to quit... ||||| I don't know how young you are, but he's clearly on the early stages so it's all about changing his views on smoking. Try to make smoking seem disgusting. Try not to hang around him when he's smoking. Maybe he'll figure it out himself! ||||| You can't make him stop but you can show him what he's letting himself in for by carrying on. It's like they say: you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.  Show him this Reddit - show him the pain and mental torment people go through when they're having to quit a habit that was years in the making. If he's only been smoking a couple of weeks then he's not going to find it too hard to quit now. The longer he leaves it though, the harder it will be. And good on you for being such a caring friend and having his back. 
7171	1,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3	18	Alright ladies and gents, as baseline draws nearer I think we should talk about plants, their uses, and our food options. This has been a topic of discussion I keep coming across that should be implemented (however primitively) in Rust baseline. This is just to get the discussion going and generate new ideas about upcoming features in rust. As someone who loves to camp and has taught basic survival (at a scout camp. It got real more than once) I believe plants are currently WAY under used.  **First Section: Plants as Food**  In the current [Mind Map]([URL] there is a section that mentions farming and berry picking. This is a great plan for the future as plants are the basis of a forest (or otherwise) diet. Currently you have to get a weapon, find an animal, hunt it, cook it and finally eat it. This is rather tricky (despite AI issues) as meat is more "late game" in a real world survival situation. Your first option for food is likely going to be a plant (if you know what it is. remember: poison!) With this we could get seeds and then lead to farming (A confirmed feature.) This would help lead us in the direction of settlements and make us less likely to kill each other for food (Let’s be honest. You've done it. I've done it. Shame on us.)    **Second Section: Uses of Plants, Clothing**   Plants are very useful for survival with the right know-how. You can make medicine, clothing, poisons, etc. With leaves you could make hats or clothing. I think the current idea that you need to kill an animal for clothing is just silly. With the palm trees along the beaches why can’t we make [hula skirts and coconut bras?]([URL] All joking aside, I think that staring off you should have the option to make some easier form of clothing or some kind of camouflage. Like [this hat]([URL] or [this grass skirt.]([URL] Clothing is just the tip of the iceberg here as well.   **Second Section Pt2: Medicine and Poison**    With the right herbs you can make medicine and poisons. Mamma Nature give us quite a few friends and enemies in the plant kingdom. What about natural hazards of poison ivy and deadly mushrooms or deadly berries (as mentioned above)? We could make healing teas with the fresh spring water or add poison to food or weapons. With all these options gardening and farming would be way more rewarding. With the idea of gardens why not be able to cover a base in itchy ivy? Or flowers? Or ferns? We could even go as far as use these plants as bait for animals to hunt and catch. Animals like birds, rabbits, or those invisible chickens.    *What do you think? Is this a feature that should be added as a part of base line? What would you want to see?*   ||||| We need drugs which have practical uses but addictive qualities as other threads have stated. they need to boost stats decently so they are useful but have devastating enough drawbacks to think twice about spamming a drug. sorta like we used to do with chicken in fire fights, so ive come up with a few examples.  Examples:  steroids - +25% melee dmg and gather rates/withdraw: -25% movement speed  Alcohol -  Warmer in snow areas and no bleed/withdraw: +25%craft timer  Magic Mushrooms - Night Vision and no footsteps/withdraw -25% health in daylight  Cannabis - +75% comfort and +15%droprate   /withdraw -50% hydration and calories  Meth - +25% movement speed and -25% craft timer/Withdraw no sprint  just a few rough ideas, id like to see stat boosting items introduced but with a likely hood of backfire if you cant procure your fix, now im not suggesting you use one of these once and your addicted rather, addiction happens with repeated exposure. relatively id say doing a drug would have a 10% addiction rate if you were to do that drug twice within X amount of time after your cool down from your previous use. and the percentage would get higher until your addicted or it would drop depending if you stopped using. i was also going for drugs being used interchangeably that way if your in withdraw from one drug you can pop another drug and restore the negative stat, but exposing yourself to addiction of another drug aswell.    so please id enjoy some feedback on this to see where the community stands, we already have naked men, why not push the envelope? ||||| I love this idea bro do it to baseline! ||||| I'd love to add poison dipped arrows, slowing/crippling the enemy over time.  ||||| Havent we hit baseline (legacy equiv) pretty much already?, only thing i can think of we dont have are flares/signals and weapon mods (which I dont think are ever coming) ||||| very neat ||||| I would be happy if burlap clothes were made from burlap XD ||||| I look forward to plants with practical purposes. Coca leaves for 2X speed and melee atack but a hit on HP. Mushrooms for psychadelic screen overlay and phantom wolves. Salvia for turning on the skybox, in game physics debugging and freeze-frame "visions" of other players gameplay at random. Mad as a box of frogs. ||||| If plants are getting added, marijuana must be added with them. No exceptions.
6021	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	8	Please help.  Recently my mom found out she owes taxes for this year after I tried to help her with a tax professional.  She is now blaming me for her owing taxes, and she is threatening to sell my car.    She originally bought the car in 2009 (new Honda Civic) with a down payment of $10,000 in her name.  But since 2012 I've been paying for the monthly car payments, maintenance, and new tires.  I finally paid it off this past February 2014.  I let my mom hold on to the title thinking I could trust her, but now I regret not putting the car in my name.  I have very limited money and drive about 30 miles to work every day.  I need that car in order to survive, my mom has her own car, too (VW Tiguan).  What are my rights for keeping the car?  Can she really take possession and sell it?  Would I be entitled to any of the money she made from selling the car?   ||||| If the vehicle is titled and registered to her, it is legally her car and she can do what she wants with it. ||||| She has the title, so she can sell it, so you are kind of screwed. ||||| Maybe there's another way to deal with the situation. If the tax return was prepared in error your mom may file a 1040X amended return with the correct information. You could also have your mom arrange an installment plan with the IRS and you pay the bill. It's a pretty terrible solution but if its the tax bill is less than what you've paid into the car it may be worth it especially if the vehicle is in good condition. ||||| How much money, in total, have you put into the car (including maintenance and car payments)? Do you have receipts?  If she sells the car you can take her to small claims court for the amount of money you put in to the car, but you might have a tough time winning that case. To do so you would at least have to convince the judge that these payments were made with the understanding of both parties (you and your mom) that the car would belong, at least in part, to you. Right now she hold all the cards (she owns the car) but it's *possible* that a sympathetic judge might rule in your favor, monetarily. That wouldn't get "your" car back, and you'd still have to collect that money from your mother (sounds like she doesn't have any to spare). ||||| >What are my rights for keeping the car?   Only as much right as she gives you.  >Can she really take possession and sell it?  Legally, it's hers.  She can do whatever she wants with it.    > Would I be entitled to any of the money she made from selling the car?   Probably not.  How old are you?  You could always try to take her to small claims court if you can provide evidence you were the one paying for the car even though it is in her name, but I feel that would do more harm than good.  ||||| *I am a bot whose sole purpose is to improve the timeliness and accuracy of responses in this subreddit.*  ---  **It appears you forgot to include your location in the title or body of your post.**  **Please update the original post to include this information.**  ---  [Report Inaccuracies Here]([URL] | [Author]([URL]  
4541	1,3,3	9	1. Is there any way to automate filling the belljars with reagents?  2. Does the ritual of magnetism have a Y level limit?   My idea is to make an automated mining system using BM, put a teleposer under it and send the separate teleposer on its way using funky locomotion somewhere high up, then I just need to automatically activate the teleposer every X minutes/hours and it will just move to the new spot and start mining again.  ||||| The Ritual Of Magnetism doesn't have a Y limit, it pulls ores all the way from bedrock upwards (I had my funky locomotion/BM miner at Y=200 to avoid hills getting in the way). I dunno about the bell jars though ||||| Automated filling works, check out DW20, he has quite a few videos on it. The second most recent forgecraft series has him doing it for all the mining stuff instead of running an enderquarry.
5004	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	20	Hey /r/geology! I hope this is ok to post here! My 91yo Great Uncle recently downsized his house and moved from NJ to FL. Part of the downsizing process was trimming his really extensive rock collection so he gave a bunch to my family. We're going through and some are incredibly stunning. The only problem is we're having a little trouble identifying some of them! That's where you guys come in! If you could take a look and see if you know what these are, that'd be great!  1. [URL] 2. [URL] 3. [URL] 4. [URL] 5. Edit: [URL]  Thanks!  Edit: Thanks everyone for your responses, it's much appreciated! ||||| 1. Silicon carbide, manmade. 2. Not sure. 3. Chalcedony, dyed green. Forms from microcrystalline quartz filling in a cavity in the rock in layers. The intensity of the color depends on conditions inside the cavity when the layer is forming. 4. Not entirely sure, but I want to say it looks like serpentine. It's a collection of minerals formed by the hydration of ultramafic (mantle derived) rocks. Does it feel a little waxy? ||||| 4 could be Azurite + Malachite? Hard to tell. ||||| Excellent work, /u/jccwrt. Spot on.  For the second one, I'm leaning toward some type of microcrystalline silicate, maybe a chert or agate. The flaking looks right. See if it scratches glass. ||||| Also, I'm sorry if the pictures aren't the best! I'm new to rock photography and don't have the best camera :(. ||||| My guess for 4 would be a blueschist facies metamorphic rock.  The blue mineral would be glaucophane and green jadeite.  [URL] ||||| 2 looks like marble.  ||||| For the second one, maybe a quartz-feldspar pegmatite kind of thing? ||||| [empty] ||||| 1. Silicon Carbide (artificial) 2. Looks like Sodalite 3. Chalcedony coloured by, I think nickel. 4. Garneirite (nickel silicate), nickel ore.  The apple green colour, to me, is distinctive of nickel, copper is usually a richer grassy green. It would make sense if the mineral specimens are from Canada. There is (or was?) nickel mines there that mined garneirite.

I'm not even talking full AP Alistar, I'm talking Tank, Tri-force, Jungle, AP, ANYFUCKINGLISTAR. Alistar's kit is just amazing. You can split push if you go either of the damage routes, you can support a lane well with support/tank. His ganks from the jungle are great with flash>pulv>headbutt. You can initiate if your team is ahead, you can push threats from your carry. All the CC and his overall kit make Alistar OP in solo queue.  EDIT: I don't actually mean he has a broken mechanic.

No. ||||| Apparently you haven't seen mid AP Ali yet ||||| I can't tell you how many people don't separate "OP" from "Good" or "Strong" in their vocabulary.     · When you refer to a champion being "OP", you're insinuating that he is so strong that they deserve or expect to be nerfed.     · When you refer to a champion being "Good" or "Strong", they are a great pick, are in a good place with the current meta, but do not have any characteristics that cause landslide wins most of the time if you have them on your team. ||||| very strong, not OP ||||| Do you guys feel he's still auto-ban every game (at low ELO that is, 1300-1400 where I am)? ||||| Alistar is a great champion.

Whenever I played ranked before I would always get really frustrated quit after awhile (either league or just ranked ques) and get demoted. Try again and get demoted again after stopping.  Now I have been playing some ranked 5s with friends and we got gold really easy, and I thought "I can do this in solo que damn it! This time I am gonna do it" and it happened over a week i went from silver 3 into gold 5, and since then ranked has become so much more fun, now there is no more stress or frustration if we lose the game, oh well! and I've been winning more since then, playing Vel'koz mid mostly because of Sp4zie, and I've been performing great...  My point really is I think if I had just gotten over the stress of getting to gold I think it would have been a lot easyier to reach my goal, so all of you trying to climb just go in with a positive attitude (I have always tried to follow that rule) and if you lose the game, hey! Whatever you just keep on trying buko, don't play champs that are "OP" right now play something you enjoy, also I have found people don't always know how to play against niche champions..  I will stop ranting now  This is Practical from EU West And i am now happy with solo que.   [URL] (my profile if anyone is curious) ||||| Don't ever get out of there... You gotta hate platinum... So stressful and only op champs pratically. Yo-yo feeling (i think i reached plat 2 and dropped to 5 two times already). I liked my gold days, although i did not play in that elo range for long ||||| Try not to push for Plat, honestly the worse league I've ever been in, EUW + EUNE both as bad!! ||||| Agree, went through gold really fast and got to plat...I want to demote back to gold  ;_; ||||| I agree, gold is true elo heaven. At least in EU.  source: Gold 2 on EU-W ||||| Gold is elo heaven in NA also ||||| Last season was my first season of playing ranked. (I had put it out on purpose to actually get decent before I started playing ranked at all). In my placements, I duo'd with a Plat friend and we went 8-2, placing me in Gold 4. I thought 'Sweet, no need to tryhard to try and get Gold this season'. Later in the season another friend hits 30 with his smurf and asks me to play with him. I thought 'why not?' and we played a good amount together just for fun. Suddenly I'm top Gold 2 and thinking about trying to get Plat (I almost succeeded - failed my Plat 5 placements twice :(). My point with all this, is that it seems, like you said, that when you are actually playing the game for fun, you do way better and enjoy it aswell! ||||| I hate gold... I was bronze on NA and silver last season. Started to watch good streams, (krepo is a god! Most informative streams ever ) so I started climbing.   Reached gold a while back and then the trolls commenced... I almost hope I'll be silver again next season>I have always wanted to at least get gold.. I have never gotten it before, and mind you I have been playing this game for a long long time. Whenever I played ranked before I would always get really frustrated quit after awhile (either league or just ranked ques) and get demoted. Try again and get demoted again after stopping.  Any promo got me platinum opponents the first 4 times, all other games were 1 good followed by at least one bad. Afk or disconnected or flamers and sure I played bad games .  But it's all gone to hell the last few weeks. I stopped playing except during school hours which worked a lot. But still 1 good vs 1 bad, I'm documenting them all now but I hope you have better luck. ||||| I went from Gold to Platinum easily last preseason. Been stuck in Plat 4-5 for the entire season ||||| *facepalm* "in the solo que" ||||| Just wait for Plat... never go there ||||| For me, gold is for the people who are happy getting out of the low elo, but content with not having plat/diamond.  ||||| I hated Silver, because I was stuck in silver for like 800 ranked games last season and ended up in Silver 2 at the end, this season I went silver to gold with ease and Gold was honestly the best for me, I hit plat and omg the pain Plat was worst than when i was in bronze and silver thank god i crawled my way to diamond, Plat was horrible ||||| For me plat was fine not much different to any other elo i climbed really quicklu tho i might of just got lucky

9398	1,3,3,3,3,3	7	I was just rereading neoclash's response to how much money and time he spent to get top 5 in the PCC. He said he "spent $180 total. Actually ended up with about $240 dollars worth of credit because Amazon was kicking back $15 worth in coins if you purchased the $50 tier in-game."  So he was definitely getting the best deal there, $240 for $180.  I was wondering from time to time iTunes or amazon has a promotion like that. It behooves the consumer to get the best bang for their buck of course. So do I game credits transfer between devices?  Example: I play mainly on my iOS devices. I also play occasionally via BlueStacks. I have both games connected via Facebook, so the account is the same. If I buy credit from iTunes, will it show up for me in BlueStacks. ||||| no matter what device you play on, as long as you buy credits on it the credits will be stored on the account if you log into Facebook or Amazon or Google Play, etc. on another device. like, I buy credits via Amazon at times and then switch over to the Google Play version of the game, using my Google+ login on both ends and it stores it. it also stores if I buy credits on Google Play and switch to Facebook, etc. ||||| I think I understand what you're asking and if I do then the answer is yes  I play on an iPod because my android phone can get laggy at times so I use the iPod because it's faster  During PCC I wanted to buy credits to use to get title matches. So I went to 7/11 and since they don't sell 10 iTunes cards I got a $10 Google Play card. I redeemed the code and now had $10 in my Google play account. All I had to do was buy the credits on my phone and then they showed up on my iPod as well. (I use facebook).  ||||| bluestacks is android, so probably not, unless you manage to link via facebook I assume. ||||| They will transfer since your account is linked to your facebook. I play on a Kindle and Bluestacks and can see them from both. ||||| Here is the trick: regardless of which platform you use, Facebook is an option. So log in through both Facebook and whichever program comes with your platform (it's GameCenter for iPhone; I don't know what it is for Android). Doing this will forever link your account regardless of platform because you'll be able to use Facebook as the bridge.

1627	1,3,3,3,3,3	7	I see a lot of pictures on r/minecraft with automated farms but can't find much information about them. Would like some help if possible :D ||||| find spawner,  make a drop of like 25 blocks (dont know the exact amount but this does the trick)  make plateau with sings on all sides, water beneath to collection point. also make sure to hit their feet or else skeletons can get nasty :) |||||  * Collect mobs  * Push them down 22-23 blocks  * Hit them so they die and drop experience  Automate these 3 steps as much as possible, using mob spawners or water flows, for example. ||||| Someone posted this picture on r/minecraft a little while ago. Very helpful  [URL] ||||| For a exp farm using zombies, I would first suggest getting the required items for splash potions of healing, as they actually hurt the undead mobs(zombies, skeles), well this is all after you have found a zombie spawner. Next hollow out a 8x8 room around the spawner, 6 blocks high, 2 being under the spawner. set up water streams on the ground flowing to a canal, which is also 8 blocks long. have the canal lead to a vertical shaft, with water source blocks being held in place with signs. It should then drop the zombies 20-23 blocks. Now you will be able to set a piston to act as a gate so the zombies dont drop, unless you open the piston with a lever. You want the piston set up above the hole for dropping. When the piston is not activated it will allow zombies to drop, and build up when activated. once you let it sit for a while, open the piston gate, let the zombies drop and throw the splash potion at them. You will kill the majority of them, and then just finish them off with a your fists.  ||||| I have found that the best way is to use cave spider spawners.  It's usually fairly easy to find 2 within 16 blocks of each other in a abandoned mine.  From there, you build a room around each and merge the two into one feed.  Basics found here: [URL]

2726	1,0,2,3,0,0,0,3	22	Maybe my perceptions are just warped, but I'm a little confused by the comments that I've seen on r/atheism recently.  I've seen a particular argument arise many times in many different comment sections and I thought it deserves addressing. There's a growing voice that is attempting to shift the blame away from religion and towards human nature.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen the old, "There are plenty of nice theists. It's not the religion, it's the individual person. There are also mean, bitter atheists."  Sure, that entire quote is completely true. It's also COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. We KNOW that people can be assholes regardless of declared philosophy. We KNOW that being irrational doesn't mean that somebody lacks empathy or compassion. We KNOW that being religious, or non-religious doesn't make you a better person. These are all beside the point.  The point is, sometime, we will have to work together. That's why we have rationalism in the first place. IF we can agree on the facts, then we can move forward and cooperate together towards common goals. Faith just fucks up the whole system. You can't refute, verify, test, or quantify faith claims. Faith allow erroneous, irrelevant, asinine, uninformed, inaccurate, sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful claims to pass as "justified" and it shouldn't.  The only way we can communicate ideas is through reason and faith is unreasonable.  Theism is a just a particular subset of non-rational world-views. It's just a flagship issue for a larger problem. We need to be rational, else the best we can hope for is lucky guesses.  People can be bad or good but that doesn't erase the philosophical issues with anti-rational stances. ||||| No, people with religion are the problem. ||||| So, some people just naturally want to legislate inequality in rights? They have no good reasons for it, though, so they resort to quoting bible verses to back themselves up? ||||| People are the problem not religion. Down below someone said that religion is a human construct. He/she is completely right, religion is something that was created by humans. So if people made religion how can religion be the problem? ||||| Look, I am agnostic, but I think your entire take here is just too angry for me not to comment.  Yes, religion has done a lot of bad. And yes, there are a lot of religions that encourage a lot of bad things.  This does not mean that all religions are bad. Nor does it prove that religion is bad for society.  There are religions (and versions of Christianity) that actually thinking, questioning, self-reflection, etc.   The line of logic here does not hold, because it singles out religion for failings that exist in general. If anythings, this suggests that the common denominator: people are the problem. ||||| "It's not the religion, it's the people," is crap.  Religion shapes the culture that people grow up in. This influences how they behave.  It's not *completely* religion's fault, nor is it *completely* people's fault. Neither gets *complete* blame, but both are part of the problem. ||||| No, religion is the problem.  As you stated, people can be good without religion.  They can also be evil without the religion.  However..."*for good people to do evil — that takes religion.*" - Steven Weinberg  Without religion, there is no reason for good people to do evil. ||||| > We KNOW that being religious, or non-religious doesn't make you a better person.  When your religion contains a holy commandment to do an evil thing, and because you are religious and believe the commandment you do that evil thing, religion has made you a worse person.
6239	1,3,3,3,3	10	I currently fluctuate between 44 and 46 pants, but aside from "dress slacks" there seems to be little to nothing available for me.

It will probably take a lot of time to find clothes that will flatter your body.  Go around and start shopping while you're losing weight, because that does certainly help (and you'll lose weight in the meantime).  I'd recommend thrift stores too, as they are cheap and seem to have a lot of random bigger clothes. ||||| Your best bet is too look into budget options for your current weight/figure, and then once you find your style and reach target buy more lasting. Thrifting could be a easy start given all the larger cut stuff found, plus shopping at places known to cut larger(landsend, ll bean, etc) ||||| Go cheap on the things that will change as you lose weight (shirts, pants) and fill your spending desires on quality things that aren't affected by weight as much (shoes, accessories)
7721	1,2,3,3,3,3,3	11	I'm not sure if time travel is scientifically plausible in any way (hey, neither were planes a few centuries ago), but let's put that aside for a moment.  Would the logic of continuity allow time travel to have any effects on the future (future being relative to the target time period)? ||||| Can you rephrase your question? It's not clear what you meant. ||||| [Grandfather Paradox]([URL]  That said, it depends on how you look at time travel.  Some say there is one "time line" and if you alter it in the past, you change the future you came from, possibly causing your own "deletion".  Alternatively, there's the possibility of divergent time lines (see *Back to the Future 2*), where the change you made in the past has created an alternate timeline, but left your own intact, thus allowing you to continue existing, but not necessarily letting you return to your own future.  Then there's the possibility that whatever you do was supposed to happen, and caused the future you came from to simply adjust around the new information (see several time travel movies such as *Timescape*).  Then, though, there's the dual possibility that you either will, or won't remember the "old" time line.  Then again, there's the "constant parallel time lines/dimensions" thing (see H. Beam Piper's *Paratime* books), whereby there are infinite parallel universes all slightly different from each other, and the "further away" you get from your own, the more different they are.  So the "next one over" from this one is practically identical, except maybe Pepsi and Coke are in each other's shoes, but the one ten over starts to look quite a bit different, like maybe the UK has no monarch.    In which case if you go back in time and make a change, maybe you actually switch to the one where that change was made, and remove yourself from your original time line altogether?  In all cases the "future", like time itself, doesn't actually exist, and carries on regardless of what's happening.  Except the one where you go back in time, meet/touch yourself, and the entire universe implodes.  Personally, I'm a fan of the *everything is happening all at once and "time" as we perceive it, is simply our way of dealing with that* theory.   Simon Hawke called it "Zen Physics" in his *Timekeeper* series, because it can hurt your brain.  edit: typos ||||| Divergent timelines makes most sense to me. That also means that you cannot return to your own timeline, since in order for that to be possible, you would have already had to have traveled back in time in your timeline, but if you did change what you wanted to change then you would not have any reason to go back in time, thus we have a paradox.  You could return to a timeline that is virtually identical to your original timeline except for the thing you did change (and the repercussions that change had), but it would not be the same timeline. ||||| >Would the logic of continuity allow time travel to have any effects on the future (future being relative to the target time period)?  Of course, since time is an emergent property and not real, you would be able to alter the entropic dimensions and easily have your future relative to the target time period. ||||| [Time Travel Tropes]([URL] Happy reading. ||||| I have always envisioned TT as being an ability to VIEW the past rather than physically go back and interact with the past.  If you could go back and interact then you would cause a divergent timeline where the outcome would be different to the one you saw occur, however when you return to the future you would return to your own timeline rather than the divergent timeline, since you are missing from your own timeline, but the divergent timeline would have a version of you who knew you had gone back and interfered.  Hence why, if it ever came to pass, I would see the technology used to view the past from any angle, obv no sound since the screen would be incapable of feeling the vibrations of noise.
3761	1,2	6	This was originally Q3 from the senior 2011 [Waterloo CCC] ([URL]   **Problem Description:** ------- ---  Alice is looking at a crystal through a microscope. Alice’s microscope has the interesting feature that it can superimpose grid lines over the image that she is looking at. At level 1 of magnification, Alice sees the image like this:  [URL]    She sees the crystal in a 5x5 "grid".   Notice that at level 1, there is a 5×5 grid superimposed over the image. However, as Alice increases the magnification, the leaf pattern becomes more intricate   [URL]  At level 2 of the magnification, Alice sees the image with a 25 × 25 grid, and notices that three of the four larger squares in the original image have the small four square pattern on top. In fact, for this particular crystal, this self-similarity repeats for each magnification level.  Alice's microscope has a maximum of 13 levels of magnification.   Alice decides associate coordinates to each individual cell in her grid, and lets the current level of magnification equal the integer *m*. This means that (0,0) would be the top left corner and (5^*m*-1, 5^*m*-1) would be the bottom right corner. Given a coordinate (*x*,*y*) and magnification level *m*, Alice wants to whether a crystal can be found at that cell.   **Formal Inputs & Outputs** -- ---  Input description ---  The first line of input will be T which is the number of test cases. On each of the next T lines there will be three integers: *m*, the magnification level, followed by *x* and *y*, the position of the grid cell that Alice wishes to examine.  Output description --- "empty" if a a crystal does not occupy a cell, "crystal" if it does  **Sample Inputs:** --- **Input 1**      4     1 1 1     1 1 0     1 2 1     2 8 5  **Output 1**      empty     crystal     crystal     crystal  **Explanation:**  Line 1: There are four lines in the input after this one  Line 2: Under magnification 1, check if cell (1,1) is occupied  Line 3: Under magnification 1, check if cell (1,0) is occupied  Line 4: Under magnification 1, check if cell (1,1) is occupied  Line 4: Under magnification 2, check if cell (2,8) is occupied    **Input 2**      8     4 508 369     1 1 2     2 11 13     3 44 9     3 49 10     2 10 13     2 12 15     4 136 578 **Output 2**      empty     empty     empty     crystal     crystal     empty     empty     empty  **Challenge Input** ----      3     9 931879 729693     12 167293144 170627425     11 13401522 30432662    **Output**      empty     empty     crystal     empty ||||| I should understand, but I just don't :P  Maybe the input should make clear what the magnification level, and which cell to check is?  The hard part to understand, if there is any, is the method for how these progress, and exactly how its related to previous observation if that is part of the challenge.

9152	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	20	So I finally played Watch Dogs after hotly anticipating it forever (haven't finished the story yet, so no spoilers please). People are wrong when they say it's a terrible disappointment, but I felt there were just a few simple things that would have made it a lot better that if used in a sequel would make it perfect. I was hoping Reddit could weigh in:  *A higher difficulty curve. One of the things I was disappointed by was how powerful you are right from the start. It takes a fraction of a second to hack something, which made it feel a little unsatisfying. I expected that you would start with only one weak profiler ability like signal jamming and work your way up. And you do upgrade, but how powerful you are at the beginning takes away the urge to work toward upgrades. Far Cry 3 is a great example of how a Watch Dogs sequel could handle this better; you start with virtually nothing, which makes upgrading much more enticing.  *The random criminal encounters shouldn't be so finicky. Possibly my biggest frustration with the game was how easy it is to accidentally tip off the criminals and stop something that could have been fun. This led me to wasting time tailing a criminal with no payoff. In a sequel, it would be more satisfying if the crime basically is going to happen whether you're there or not. The window of time where you can swoop in and save the day should be much bigger too. Many times I felt like the crime was easily in progress by the time I intervened, only to accidentally abort it because I was half a second early. It's odd that the guards can be so ignorant when you're knocking over a control center, yet the random criminals seem to have perfect eyesight and superhuman peripheral vision. The problems with this feature make it feel not so much unsatisfying as broken.  These are the major ones that stood out to me. What would you like to see? Improved driving? A better story? ||||| Random crime where CtOs Doesn't warn you should be stoppable. I shoot the criminal in the foot while he pulls the knife back, but the civilian still falls. ||||| Fix the broken multiplayer. No circle when "fixer on my tail". Let game move when paused always, not just multiplayer. Remove focus, or change its mechanic. Allow players to sit or lean.  ||||| The game would've been so much better if Aiden had more restricted access to guns.  Free access to a half dozen of each type of gun without consequence made the game way too easy.  In a city with some of the tightest gun control laws in the US, you shouldn't be able to go to a store, buy an M416, and tuck it into your trenchcoat next to your 3 shotguns and 5 pistols.  Aiden should have unrestricted access to a pistol that he can easily conceal, and he should have to work for or find more powerful weapons that can't be conceald and will quickly attract attention. ||||| Doing a weely while riding the bike ||||| Loading the game to 100% and not corrupting save files. ||||| Don't give the enemies in convoy missions grenades. 9/10 times they kill the target. ||||| Remove focus completely.

Fucking waste of money. ||||| We are already talking about a sequel? Sure the game is a little iffy but give the devs some time to clean their mess up. Then again you can say they have had time due to them delaying the release date and such. But if you want my opinion then here you go. - better driving mechanics - fighting with your bare hands or different weapons need to be in next game - that little karma bar is worthless. There needs to be more pros and cons than just a pedestrian calling the police right away.  - change of clothing  -  escaping in water should not be easy anymore etc... I could put more down but I'm sleepy and want some pancakes so yeaaaa. ||||| I'm disappointed that it's exactly like the engine for AC series, just different graphics and no building climbing.  I suppose cop AI is difficult, because in GTA it's kinda lame, too. I'd like cops to be a bit more realistic: you can't just spawn 10 cars in 20 seconds, and you can't just expect to get away with murder just because you hid someplace for 30 sec.  I'd like less silly virtual game stuff and rather have more interesting NPCs with more variety of actions you can perform on them

4659	1,0,2	9	This might be old news, but I thought of something. You know on FNAF 2, where Phone Guy says that the animatronics go on a murderous rampage on anyone who has committed a crime? Me neither. He says they have facial scanners to detect if someone is a criminal. Now, it's said by many that this is complete BS, but what if maybe... Jeremy was the Purple Guy? It's absurd, I know, but there's more evidence to it than you think! Purple Guy was seen in SAVETHEM with a badge. In the FNAF 2 location. Also, "Welcome to your new SUMMER job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. In Five Nights at Freddy's 4, we see Purple Guy wearing what is assumed to be shorts. Also, we see sunflowers at the doorstep of the Bite Kid's house. Sunflowers could mean Spring, but it is CERTAINLY not Fall. Why bring up it's not Fall? Remember that feeling you got when you beat Night 5 on FNAF 2? Well, how about the paycheck? "November, 1987". **November**. November is in Fall. Now we know the Purple Guy was seen in Late Spring, or any point in Summer. There was also a murder outside of Fredbears Diner. How do we know it was Fredbear's? Well, Scott Cawthon stated that Game Theory got *almost* everything right, (meaning Phone Guy isn't Purple Guy). And if GT says that it was Fredbear's, and Scott Confirms GT was right, then, well, that speaks for itself. Anyway, back to the murder. As seen in the Puppet Death Minigame, Fredbear is giving cake to 5 angry children, while the Purple Man kills a child. Purple Guy is seen as an employee in Fredbear's in FNAF 4. Now you're probably wondering, "What does all this have to do with Jeremy"? Well, Jeremy is seen at the near-same time as Purple Guy. Coincidence? I don't think so. Purple Guy wears a badge, showing he's either a guard, or works there for some other reason. Say he was a guard. Then that leads to Jeremy. Not to mention Jeremy would be WAY too old to work at the FNAF 3 location. If you find plot-holes in this theory, PLEASE, point them out. Thanks for reading, if you didn't get bored half way through. EDIT: Need more proof? How's this... in the Puppet Death Minigame, you're in a small room right? Well, that's a REALLY small room for a whole restaurant, ya think? Well, it's OBVIOUSLY not the whole restaurant, instead the (un)Withered Animatronics location. (Heck, let's call it Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and Scary Robots, or FFPASR). So, in FFPASR, you have Pre-W. Freddy, Pre-W. Bonnie, Pre-W. Chica and Pre-W. Foxy. This is where the 5 deaths occur. In the Foxy GO GO GO Minigame, you see, of course, Foxy the Pirate Fox running down a hall, to meet 5 children, who later appear dead. Why the heck am I talking about this? It's yet another appearance of the ominous Purple Guy. He is in yet another small room. Again, this would be stupid to be a whole restaurant. This points toward the Foxy is in the FFPASR location. Now, what if I told you this: The FFPASR location is the FNAF 1 location. If you haven't left yet, good for you, because this is where it all ties together. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and Scary Robots closes down due to the murders and later re-opens as the FNAF 1 location. Jeremy meanwhile, is growing older and wants one last chance at going to Freddy's, good times sake I suppose, but he's got a plan. Dismantle the Animatronics. When there, he dismantles the robots, gets brutally murdered, yada yada, but his story continues: as Springtrap. (Not that you didn't know that, like it's common knowledge). When in Fazbear's Fright, he sees Night Watch, and is surprised. He sees none other than Mike Shmidt. Evidence is that Phone Dude says "Hey! Glad to see you here another night,". Now this wouldn't be so weird...  if it wasn't Night 1. He pleads to Mike to "Help Me", and wants it all to end. Mike burns down Fazbear's Fright, and Game Over.........?   Ok, so half of that wasn't related to the theory at all, but still, it's my first theory and... well post for that matter. Enjoy! ||||| >There was also a murder outside of Fredbears Diner. How do we know it was Fredbear's? Well, Scott Cawthon stated that Game Theory got almost everything right, (meaning Phone Guy isn't Purple Guy).   Scott *never* said PG =/= PG was the **only** thing they got wrong, Take Cake is definitely not Fredbear's because that bear is just like Freddy in the other minigames. ||||| He said *almost* everything was right, but are you sure Scott meant by that, Phone Guy isn't Purple Guy ?
7028	1,3,3	17	I'm trying to make a spreadsheet that works with my bi-weekly budget. I want one that is smarter.

We ordered the duck plus another five dishes for six people. The bill was only less than $100 not including tax. The secret is to talk to Kelly at the front door who will help you with ordering.  We had:  * Peking Duck (highly recommend this)  * Mike's fried chicken  * deep fried ribs (short ribs? couldn't tell)  * lotus root casserole  * lamb casserole  * duck fried noodles  * roast pork   Everything was really delicious and well worth the trip. If you've been or are planning to go, please share your experiences.  ||||| Their new location is great- so much cleaner than their old spot.

6149	1,3,3,3	12	Hey guys  So I just finished a long weekend and I decided to challenge myself by going to the gym every day during it. I would normally workout twice a week on the weekends (45 minutes of cardio). This time around I did 4 straight days of cardio workouts with the Saturday session going for a full hour followed by my first bout with body resistance training.  Needless to say I'm still rather sore from the resistance training. After all of this, my weigh in yesterday showed that I'd only lost 1 pound for the week, which is smaller than usual.  So with all of that information, how likely is it that my weight has been fudge'd due to water retention? ||||| Very likely. It happens to me on the clock. I've had three plateaus in 120 days, all preceded by an increase in intensity and duration of exercise. I did not only stop losing, I "gained" several pounds. After the plateaus were over I dropped pounds like crazy. ||||| Very possible. I've been sore a couple of times and it always came with a couple of pounds of water. It dropped about 48 hours later. ||||| Muscles under stress like to retain water. I learned that the hard way on a 60 mile walk (over three days.) I ended that 3 days about 7-9 pounds heavy than when I started...if I hadn't been warned about it ahead of time I probably would freaked out a bit.  Now when I change things up and work out harder or longer, I expect it. It's not usually that much, but there's often a couple extra pounds when I've pushed hard.

Light gray if your really feeling it. Don't do black, unless you want to be wearing the same suit as everybody else. You also don't want to buy a suit to match your date.    Most people would say that you want a 100% wool suit, but since you're in high school and nobody cares, get a wool blend. I got a suit from macy's online for like $160, so go check online there. But make sure you know your size first.   Honestly, you will just want to have a tie that matches your date. Nothing more than that or else you will look tacky. ||||| Try [here] ([URL] ||||| 1) fit fit fit get it and tailor it. please dont have the length so long it piles up around your ankles (look at pants break to see what i mean)  2) match a primary color or a secondary color in the dress with your accessories. dont go matchy matchy!!! it looks silly if you match pattern for pattern. for formal events I would go with a darker charcoal suit although a dark blue would be fine too.  3) the pocket square you can match the dress pattern  4) if your looking for something reasonable for a kid. then [Bar III at macy's]([URL] is probably your best bet.  get it tailored to fit you better. read about how a suit fits. understand how a suit should fit. KNOW how a suit fits!  5) make sure to have decent dress shoes too. those can wreak an outfit faster than anything ||||| One matches the formality of the event, NOT the dress of the lady.  Ever.  Unless she says, "No hoo-nanny unless you match".  In that case you complement her with your pocket square or the tie...the suit color plays no role in the matching equation.

7473	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	23	I'm on my mobile, It's hard to write a lot without having to autocorrect everything. So long story short. My boyfriend and I had an argument and we takes briefly in between. However, I asked him why did just called me and did not meet me in person to talk. I went beck home to moms house and I expected him to show up to moms house, flowers or not, to apologize. He said he has too much work to do and his.job needs him more and that I should have come to him! Even though we are both working. I then asked if I went missing for a week, would he come after me or call me? He said no because it was my choice? Even after a month, he said he would not come after me!! This is what broke me down. Basically, if I just up and left, he would do nothing!! This sounds so wrong and I'm hurt. Does this make sense?  Tl; Dr: Boyfriend, 26m,  said hurtful words to me, 24f, and now I'm not sure what to do? We have been dating for 2 years and living together for a year ||||| >  I went beck home to moms house and I expected him to show up to moms house, flowers or not, to apologize  So you two live together, you had a big argument, you *left the house* to go back to your mom's house, and you expected your BF to go to your mom's house to apologize to you?  Honestly, I wouldn't have chased after you either. It sounds like you moved out to punish him, or teach him a lesson or something. If he did go to your mom's to talk to you, he runs the risk of your mom getting involved in the argument.   If you want to work things out, there's no reason you couldn't have gone home, where you two live together, and work it out there. If the argument was bad enough that you *couldn't* live there, then that's another story entirely (in which case you're leaving out major details), and maybe you should meet somewhere public.  I wouldn't have chased after you because you didn't appear to want to work things out; you just wanted to punish him so he would apologize. If I were him, I would tell you that we're not working things out in front of your mom.  The other stuff, like him "not chasing after you if you went missing", sounds like heated rhetoric that you're passing off as a logical argument. I don't believe he meant that for a second.   I do believe however, that he would let you sit at your mom's house if you weren't interested in talking things out. ||||| Did you even read/consider the advice given to you on your other post? The behavior of you and your family received some criticism there, and you are still questioning why your boyfriend didn't come after you. First you gave him the silent treatment, then you ambush him with your family, and then you expect him to come begging for forgiveness? I wouldn't come after you either when you're acting so immature. Why even come back and ask for advice again.  ||||| Tough love, do not read further unless you want your feelings hurt.   You need to grow up. You are 23 years old and playing the what if game with your BF. Seriously? Grow up.   >I then asked if I went missing for a week, would he come after me or call me? He said no because it was my choice? Even after a month, he said he would not come after me!!   O good god drama level 10.   >I got my family involved already accidentally and now they are expecting an apology too.   I would leave you after that. Nothing you have and nothing you are is worth this much bullcrap. You are going to learn as you get older that you are not some princess on a pedestal that everyone worships. Disney is not real life.   >I an doing so because mom says he was mean about the gift and doesn't cares about me or my family. He was disrespectful to my family and she, wants an Apology   Think about this for a minute. Why is your mom teamed up with you against your boyfriend and what do you have that he would want to go through all this dram for? Are you stinking rich? Are you a movie star?    ||||| You sound too immature for this relationship. If you can't work things out with boyfriend without running to mommy and HER demanding an apology, then it's not an adult relationship. She has nothing to do with it. It sound slike he called to avoid getting totally ganged up on, and I don't blame him. He's in a relationship with you, not your whole family. Grow up and keep them out of it. ||||| Are you kidding me? You asked a bullshit hypothetical question and then got upset because you didn't like his bullshit answer? Bless your heart!  You went looking to get your feelings hurt and you got them hurt. Congratulations.  As for what you should do, I think that you should probably grow up a bit. The fact that you expected him to come groveling to you at your mom's house with flowers after an argument instead of discussing it in person at home shows that you're not really emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship.   I wouldn't be surprised if he gets tired of your crap and dumps you. You're high maintenance and nobody has time for that.  As for apologies to family, you caused that problem. You need to be the one to apologize to them for pulling them into your childish tantrum. ||||| Your method of arguing is inappropriate and immature.  Your goal in a relationship is to find a mutually satisfying outcome, not to "win" or force an apology. Getting your family involved, unless there is abuse, is a relationship killer.  This stuff is private.  If you train your family to hate your SO by running to them with every little complaint, you will poison any chance of a long term family dynamic.  Honestly, you need to grow up and learn better communication skills before getting into another serious relationship. ||||| I'll be blunt, you aren't acting like a 24 year old adult.  You are being manipulative, whether you intend to or not. You left in an attempt to force his hand. Then when you didn't get the response you wanted, you start playing hypothetical scenarios to further paint him as the bad guy and you pull your family into the mix to bolster your support.  It doesn't matter what your mom thinks or if she feels as though she deserves an apology. Hint: She doesn't.  It's between the two of you, keep it that way. Quit brow beating him with silent treatments and entangling your family, instead you should talk to him like an adult.  Honestly, the way you tell it, sounds like the drama wouldn't be worth it to most people. ||||| The whole "I ran away and he chased after me with flowers and an apology" is movies, not real life.  You owe him an apology for running away like a child I stead of staying and dealing with the issue like an adult.  I applaud him for not playing your little passive-aggressive games and he is absolutely right: if you wanted to be with him you would. He's not going to go chasing around the world for a little drama queen. There are millions of women out there. While I am sure he loves you very much, I am also sure he can find someone who is less passive-aggressive than you are. ||||| Oh, so *you* decided that *you* would leave after an argument and now this means *he* has to run after you? What are you - 5?  Have a conversation like an adult instead of getting your parents involved in a petty argument. ||||| I'm really confused here. Do you have a fight and leave to stay at your mother's?  Or are you mad because he disappeared for a week? ||||| The whole "running after you" thing is not something that guys really do outside the movies, unfortunately. I used to expect my ex-boyfriend to do this because it was portrayed in TV, movies, books, etc. as proof of a man's love. The truth though is that most guys see leaving as a loud and clear message saying "I don't want to talk to you or be with you right now," so they respect your need for space and don't come after you. Most guys don't see you running away as a request for them to chase after you.  When your bf told you he wouldn't come after you, you heard that he wouldn't care if you left him. But that's not what he was trying to say. In reality, he's saying that if you leave, he respects your decision to do so.   Don't be upset about this. It doesn't mean your BF doesn't care about you; it just means that men and women communicate a little differently sometimes. ||||| I'm finding a lot of inconsistencies with your post history. Aside from the obvious seek for justification by reposting your situation into different forums, six months you posted something stating you were 24 and he was 26. 
4348	1,3,3,3,3	5	Say a war between two countries. What's the objective of the war? To kill the president, like in chess? To destroy all of the other country's army? To wreck havoc the whole landscape of the country?  How one wins? How one loses? Are there rules (say, you can't drop a bomb on the middle of a resident area for no apparent reason)?  When two armies face each other on the field, like we see on the movies, what's the point? After one is diminished, what happen to the other? They come back to base? They advance? To where? Why?  I feel pretty dumb not understanding what seems to be a a pretty straightforward topic, but everytime I think about it, I can't help but fail to answers my own questions. ||||| The idea of a war is to achieve an objective.  The possibilities for what the objective is are limitless, but some might be:  * to secure control of disputed territory  * to remove certain political leaders from power  * to install a friendly government  * to destroy capability to manufacture certain kinds of weapons  * to stop or prevent another war  Generally, when your objective is met, you then figure out how to stop the war and what the terms of peace are.  Of course, the other party may not agree to the terms of peace or to stop the war, and this dispute would need to be resolved before hostilities end.  There are definitely rules to warfare.  The biggest treaty that governs this is the Geneva Conventions, which were signed in 1949 after WWII.  The Geneva Conventions have tons of rules, related to how you deal with civilians, what kinds of weapons may be used, when captured property may be destroyed, etc.  The UN Security Council is able to enforce the Geneva Conventions. ||||| Try this thread: [URL] ||||| This depends on the war your talking about and what its being fought over.  Generally you fight until the other side gives up, or there is no other side left.  ||||| I think wars are started for different reasons. It might be easier if you referenced a specific war.

7599	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	17	Hello there, good people of /r/rpg! I'm a Polish college student currently on a student exchange in America. I'm going back to Poland after Christmas and I want to bring home some good american RPGs. I'd appreciate recommendations. I'm a fan of World of Darkness and Call of Cthulhu ROG systems, but I'm open to everything. ||||| If you want a dose of distilled American flavor in your games, Unknown Armies and Monsters and Other Childish Things are two of the best. UA is an occult modern setting from the view of mid-'90s Midwestern suburbia, and MaOCT is basically Calvin and Hobbes: the RPG.  If you don't care about an American setting, I will definitely second Burning Wheel. ||||| I would say check out Burning Wheel for the LOTR fantasy-esque stories.  Dogs in the Vineyard I have only heard good things about. ||||| Check out trail of chullutu, if you like CoC it is a more modern take on CoC. ||||| It seems like you like games with dark themes. Two smaller ones you might enjoy are Don't Rest Your Head and Eclipse Phase. DRYH places you in the shoes of an insomniac who has discovered, essentially, a hidden world of dreams and nightmares and has in turn been granted a madness-fueled super power. Your goal is to find your way out before you die or fall asleep. It's very dice light and story heavy, with the main mechanic being that the more you use your power, the harder it gets to stop. And if you overuse it, well.  Eclipse Phase is similar to Call of Cthulhu in some ways, except its transhumanist post-apocalyptic horror. The short version is that humanity's war AIs decided to kill all humans, until they got bored and left the galaxy. The few humans left are scattered throughout the solar system, just trying to get along. Death is (almost) a non-issue, since you can just download backups of yourself into a new body. If you catch a visually-transmitted viral meme that makes you into a slave of the TITANs though, that's gonna be a little bit harder to survive. Basically, if you've wanted to play a horror game where you can be an intelligent octopus with plasma rifles fighting alongside a collective intelligence nanite swarm against man-made cosmic horror superweapons, you'll enjoy it. Lots of [resources]([URL] are available at the main website, including free versions of the rulebook. ||||| Shadowrun is quintessentially American.  The setting is this world sixty years in the future, after cybernetics and virtual reality have been invented, and magic has returned in 2012.  Characters are mercenary gun fighters, hackers, getaway drivers, drone pilots, and magicians hired by mega corporations and organized crime cartels to do their dirty work.  The default home town is Seattle, but has sourcebooks for the entire planet.  A new edition just came out, but not all the books are released yet.  Not sure if you'd want the newest edition or the previous one.  Each edition the advance the meta-plot by a few years. ||||| I assume you've already considered Dungeons and Dragons, the great granddaddy of them all.  The 5th edition is in the process of coming out and is a lot of fun and if you adapt the older Ravenloft setting for it it should fit well with your horror proclivities.  If World of Darkness is your cup of tea, I'd suggest Hunter: the Vigil from the new World of Darkness line if you don't own it already.  Versatile monster hunting and the investigative aspect should appeal to a Call of Cthulhu fan.  If you're willing to track down copies on eBay or go digital, grab Over the Edge and Godlike.  Over the Edge is a game of high weirdness and conspiracy in the fictional Mediterranean republic of Al Amarja.  Godlike is a WWII era superhero game with an extremely dark bent.  Both settings are absolutely stellar.  I'd also like to repeat what is likely to be a common suggestion, buy Unknown Armies.  You won't be disappointed.  Finally, what Polish RPGs, preferably in translation, would you suggest? ||||| If you want an RPG with a lot of American flavour, take a look at [Deadlands.]([URL] Set in the Wild West, players can play as everything from cowboy gunslingers, Edison style inventors or Native American shamans and fight against the strange native spirits, bizzare mythological creatures and hidden ancient horrors that populate the American midwest.  As mentioned elsewhere, Shadowrun is also very American style, as it's basically the story of Capitalism run amok until corporations control the world. It also lets you play as a Cyborg Dwarf who can remotely control robot attack dogs with his mind (and a wifi connection), who hangs out with an Elven Street Samurai and an Orc who can cast magic spells. Basically, in 2012 the world ended. And then it started again, and everything was a bit different... ||||| Well for some decidedly American RPGS Pick up Savage Worlds core rules and then DeadLands:Reloaded for cowboys and zombies.

I will also recommend Burning Wheel, it will change the way you look at role playing.   Have you played Fiasco? It is cheap, fast, and awesome.   Cortex Plus games like Marvel Heroic or Smallville are amazing, and will become collectors items as they went out of print last year.  ||||| A few games off the beaten path that you may enjoy - Blade of the Iron Throne, Burning Wheel and Eclipse Phase.  Swords & Sorcery, High Fantasy and Sci Fi respectively.  All are very different system mechanics and the feel of each is quite different from the other.  Blade and Burning Wheel are narrative driven, while Eclipse Phase is more challenge based than the other two.  Blade and BW are die pool games and Eclipse Phase is a d% game.  If you want an extremely flexible game, I'd check out Fate Core - I've used it for everything from hard Sci Fi to gritty fantasy, noir modern to medieval epics. A great system for telling character driven stories.  Best of all it's free for the rules or pay what you want for the Core Rulebook pdf. ||||| "Amrykańskie" to trochę problematyczna sprawa - nad wieloma projektami pracuje wielu ludzi z różnych krajów, a i same oficyny wydawnicze są rozrzucone po różnych miejscach, więc to czy system jest *made in USA* czy nie to czasami trudne do ustalenia.  *Numenara* i *The Strange* to niezłe, w miarę świeże pozycje. *Savage Worlds* i *FATE* to uniwersalne mechaniki, na bazie których zbudowano pełno świetnych gier.

3745	1,3,2,3,3,3,3	8	Last year, I discovered that a salon near me offered Devacuts. I went in with ugly, lifeless, tangly wavy hair, and left with CURLS - beautiful curls that I didn't realize I had!!  I haven't straightened my hair since, I only use sulfate free shampoos, I use SheaMoisture/DC products, Arc Angel gel, etc, and a diffuser.  I went back to that salon for another cut, and got a different stylist. She said she was trained in curly hair, but didn't mention Deva. I told her I only wanted a trim, as I'm trying to grow my curls longer.  When I left, I was so underwhelmed. My hair looked ok, a little wavy but the beautiful curls were gone. I've gotten my hair to look curlier than she did! She encouraged me to buy and use something called ISO Tamer Foam:   [URL]  (Second one down)  My hair hasn't been the same since. She barely even cut it, but my hair looks limp, dry and the curls definitely aren't coming out like they used to. I use all the same products, I squish (even though she told me not to leave conditioner in my hair) and use microfiber towels.  I feel like I have to start all over somehow :( ||||| After taking a quick look at the link you provided, STOP USING THAT FOAM!

You can also use FE to just stop TNT from causing block damage, which is normally my approach on a server where griefing may occur. ||||| You could use command blocks and the vanilla scoreboard system. Just make it so it deletes all TNT from the inventory of any player who didn't spend enough time on the server or didn't get any end-game achievement. ||||| Can't you add a sign shop or something that had a price for tnt that would limit people just starting out from getting it, but would be no worries for established players? Like maybe 2 trade stations, one for magic people, one for tech: 1 mana pearl or a bucket of creosite for x amount of TNT. That would cover most of both groups.

I don't mean to come off as one is better than the other, but I paid 30 bucks for DayZ, and they don't even toss around the idea of microtransactions. Its never even been brought up. I've never played H1Z1 but the idea of paying for our "Survivor GameZ" is ludacris. Nobody would do it. Why pay for something a modder could add for free.... which brings me to my next point. Someone suggested paying for skins? For fucking SKINS? LoL, DotA, etc can get away with this. Planetside 2 can get away with this because the base game is fucking FREE. Don't be so quick to accept the lesser of two evils. I didn't buy H1Z1, nor will I ever.

5210	1,3,3,3,3	11	So I've been sitting here thinking a bit.  Zombie Chow: It's a 1 mana minion with 2/3. That's +1/2 over it's mana, the same as Pit Lord which is 4 mana and 5/6 minion.  Their battlecry/deathrattle can be compared. You heal your opponent or you take dmg. Either way is a punishment for their cheap cost.  Zombie Chow gets a lot of value since it can be played turn 1. The chances for getting value out of it is incredibly bigger than getting some value from Pit Lord. Is it just me or should Pit Lord get some more value? I'm thinking +1/1 more, -3 dmg to hero or 1 mana cheaper. I have seen Pit Lord ingame 1 time. Zombie Chow is in 1/3 of all decks now it seems. It's just such a low value. For the same mana you can get Yeti which has -1/1 less than Pit Lord but you don't lose almost 20% of your health. Pit Lord just seems like a horrible card. ||||| Pit lord would probably see more play if its downside was a deathrattle instead of a battlecry. That makes all the difference IMO.  Now it makes for such a good sap target. If it was a deathrattle, one could have it synergize pretty well with wailing soul. ||||| They are not going to buff cards because they are unused. ||||| Let's try and make a pitlord viable deck.  Can't test it but here goes:  * 2x Sacrificial Pact (0) * 2x Ancient Watcher (2) * 2x Sunfury Protector (2) * 2x Ironbeak Owl (2) * 1x Sense Demons (3) * 2x Earthen Ring Farseer (3) * 2x Pit Lord (4) * 2x Voidcaller (4) * 2x Defender of Argus (4) * 2x Shadowflame (4) * 2x Sludge Belcher (5) * 2x Doomguard (5) * 2x Siphon Soul (6) * 2x Dread Infernal (6) * 1x Alexstraza (9) * 2x Molten Giant (20)  Lots of heals, op demons, basically an oddlock deck but no soulfire.  Maybe take out a dread infernal or sense demons for 1-2 soulfire idk.  I like the idea of curving from turn 3 sense demons into pitlord vs. control while still having tools like coin ancient watcher and owl for aggro.  maybe even just 1 doomguard and infernal and put in a faceless? ||||| Warlock class cards are mostly supposed to kind of suck because of the strong class ability. Also, there's Void Caller now to get the Pit Lord out for example.

2190	1,3,3,3,2,2	19	I've been wondering about getting a trackball since my G302 was double clicking a few months back. Back then I decided against it and picked a G502 based on certain criteria, and now based on another completely different criteria made me think again. It is to use mostly with a handed me down 2006 laptop, so within a limited space I can use steam in-home streaming to do some light gaming (I know I will get eventually used to it) or to use it on the go, since the trackpad, while comfortable, is a bit small. Do note that the laptop, due to how old it is it runs Linux. While I can configure it on my Windows machine, I can't do funny configurations on the fly. Don't know if it matters, but I'm no expert.  I've already did my research about brands, thumb vs finger ones, and how people is a bit polarized about them and most things trackball they have to offer and their drawbacks. The only thing I did not considered was the trackball size. So browsing again through Amazon, I've found some options, and what seems a really good deal for starters, and to test if I would like a trackball, a Kensington one for 20 euros, shipping included: [URL] My other options would be this Logitech one: [URL] for 40 euros (25 refurbished, that seems a good option since Amazon should cover it if it comes bad) or this other Kensington with scroll wheel [URL] for 39 euros which while not needed, is appreciated.  What really made me really think about it is the really low price point, which unfortunately takes out thumb trackballs out of the equation. Is the first one a good one for a test run? Should I consider something else? Did I miss something? Do you need some information that I forgot to include? (I know, a loaded question) I'm mostly sold at this point to be honest, I just want to prevent myseft from my own idiocidy making me miss something obvious and wasting time and cash on a lost cause. Thanks! ||||| the first link, the kensington orbit, is a fine trackball. it was my daily driver for a few years. just like you, i was atracted by the price. its realy well made (mine still works after like 8 years of abuse) and comfortable. just know its limitations of only having two buttons and no scroll wheel. these can be helped with some auto hot key scripts, like drag to scroll, emulate middle click with l+r click etc, but its not the best for gamming in general ||||| Ordered the Kensington Orbit in the end. Thrilled to try it tomorrow, will probably post it tomorrow some shots with my first impressions. Thanks! ||||| All three models are excellent entry point trackballs. The Logitech Marble has imho better tracking (Excellent) but its button layout will only be comfortable if you hack it (Autohotkey fixes the lack of scrolling and middle button very elegantly as described here /r/Trackballs/comments/4g8hr8/hacking_the_middle_click_and_the_scrolling_into/, other solutions exist too).

4934	1,3,3,3	4	I loved MMO's on PC, but recently got a ps4 along with Destiny The taken king(which i really like). I understand the MMO genre is not that popular on consoles, but if i were to get one, would ESO be the most ideal?Or is there a better MMO on the ps4 that i am not aware of?(also, not really fond of final fantasy series). ||||| Well ESO is only $40 on Amazon. Yea it's probably worth it, that or Final Fantasy XIV. ||||| Id say wait for a sale for ESO. It's alright but it's just that, alright; very average. If you have friends that also play ESO on PS4 the sure go for it.   If you want a game like Destiny, then I suggest looking into The Division because it's looking like what Destiny was supposed to be. ||||| No. Its enjoyable for maybe the first 60 hours, then it just gets boring.

6425	1,3,3,3	4	[empty] ||||| Not very hard, with a sharp knife you probably would have a harder time cutting pork than stabbing someone to bleed out ||||| The femoral artery is just below the surface of the inner thigh. It takes very little force to pierce a sharp blade to the depth necessary to sever the femoral artery, and the loss of blood and drop in blood pressure would cause unconsciousness within 45 seconds and death soon after. ||||| *edit: wrote the following assuming the you meant bleeding to death, rather than just "blood has been drawn" or whatever:   I think the location of the wound and the weapon involved would have a greater effect than "how hard" they were stabbed (although that in combination with with the weapon's size, shape, and sharpness would of course have a direct effect on the severity of the wound, to be fair).  I mean, is this stabbing being performed with a sword or a pen knife?  I've been told that the carotid artery, left side of the neck just below the ear, is the best target for quick painless death, so I'd equate that to bleeding out the quickest. Other locations that involve major veins, arteries, or organs would also be in the running for this, but organs have a certain amount of protection from the rib cage, and I can't imagine that  a cut femoral artery (for example) would kill the person any faster than going for the blood that is needed for the brain.  It should be understood, of course, that you shouldn't being putting this info to use in the real world. I hope you're writing a book or somesuch.

4949	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	14	When I was younger I played an excessive amount of 007 with my friends.  One day I realized that whenever I would kill someone I would move instinctively to another part of the map.  After their death animation they would spawn right in front of me and I'd take the easy kill.  Apparently the spawn order was not random and was based off the last place you spawned.  My brain unconsciously figured this out.  I often meet other people who have played 007 and talk about it fondly but to this day I have never met anyone, short of myself and two other friends I've played with, that ever figured out the respawn order was not random.  So, any redditors figure this out or am I relatively only in the universe? :)  EDIT:  I choose not to fix my typos.

4559	1,3	9	Your opinions on this, please. I've seen mixed reviews online. ||||| Extra virgin olive oil has antibacterial properties and can help prevent the bacteria helicobacter in ferrets which causes ulcers.   However, 2 issues:  first, extra virgin olive oil is quite strong and a lot of ferrets do not like the taste.  Also, it is not derived from animal protein and really has very little to no benefit to ferrets aside from it's ulcer-preventative qualities.  They can't digest it very well, so there's no need to overdo it.  A lot of people give their ferrets too much oil imo.  Too much of ANY kind of oil will cause your ferrets to have looser poops, and nobody likes having diarrhea.    Personally, I give oils (mostly salmon oil because it is actually digestible and helps skin and coat) 2 times a week in 1/4 tsp doses.  They also get a slightly smaller amount when I clip their nails (twice a month).  When I give my ferrets their oil, no matter what kind, it is mixed into 1/4 tsp of pure pumpkin.  The pumpkin helps prevent diarrhea and can also help pass hairballs and other foreign objects.  They work together very well.  A lot of people ask, "wait, pumpkin?  You just said they can't digest non-animal proteins!"  ..which is true, but that's why pumpkin works.  It absorbs excess liquid and helps push everything through the digestive system on it's way out.  tl;dr: add pumpkin to your oils, feed twice a week, win!

4496	1,3,3	5	I've just joined an established league as part of their expansion from 10 to 12 teams. They use ESPN standard scoring, but their roster format is new to me so I'd appreciate a little advice for my overall draft strategy.  Starters:  * 1 QB * 1 RB * 2 WR * 1 WR/TE * 1 Flex (RB/WR/TE) * 1 D/ST * 1 K  Then 7 bench players to fill out the roster.  The concept of only having 1 dedicated RB slot is throwing me as I'm not sure if it makes top RBs more or less valuable in the draft. Do I look to get a solid RB2 for the flex slot too, thinking that most people will look to WRs for that position?  The lack of a dedicated TE spot is less problematic, as I assume I can just pool the TEs with my WR ranks and draft as normal.  There are also hard limits of 2QBs, 8 WRs, 8 RBs, and 3 TEs per draft roster. Does this mean that I'm going to end up carrying RBs that are unlikely ever to be used, or do I target a 2nd QB and TE as they are potentially more useful?  I may be overthinking it, but every time I look at it I come out with a different conclusion. Any opinions/advice would be much appreciated. ||||| Ok-- this is a type of league you can absolutely murder.    * First of all, **throw TE out the window.** You don't have to start any, and the only TE's you'd ever want to start over a WR/RB are top tier guys (Graham, Thomas, Gronk, maybe Cameron) who will be drafted way too high by a noob who looks at the default rankings in the draft room   * **Ditch RBs in favor of WRs.** You can potentially start 1 RB and 4 WRs -- the significance of that can't be overstated. Even if you're the last person in a 12 team draft to select an RB, you'll still have a reliable starter. On the other hand, a 12 team league w/ this format can potentially START 48 WRs. Likely, over 50 WRs will be on rosters. Good luck finding any WRs on the WW.   * QBs are not a priority.   I'd take a WR at **any spot in rounds 1 and 2**, and likely 3 unless the RBs were drying up fast. I'd aim for a guy like Morris/Geodude/Bell/Martin as my RB1 in round 4, with a guy like Mathews/Jennings/Gerhart/Tate as my RB2 in round 6 or 7. I'd be the last person to get a QB, so probably a Romo/Rivers/RGIII in round 9. Once again, no TEs. Def/K at the very end. Like I said before, if you draft correctly and pick up WR depth, you will absolutely murder your league.   **Tl;dr: WRs, WRs, WRs. There will be close to 60 WRs rostered in this league -- don't screw yourself**  ||||| I'd say a VBD-spreadsheet is the way to go. Might be a little difficult to decide the baseline for every position though...  The WR/TE/RB-flex will probably be RBs only. Injuries might make it 50/50 WR/RB later in the season though. The TE/WR spot will be graham, julius thomas, gronk, vernon davis plus some receivers.  This gives you the following baseline players:  QB12, RB24, WR32, TE4, K12, D12.  If you need help making a configurable spreadsheet let me know.

7493	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	16	i'll try to keep this short. my best friend over the last 10 years has taken a turn for the worse.  he went from being a normal friend, to now every time i'm around him he is yelling, out in public, yelling all loud. drives by other cars "YO!.. YO!... what song is that?" he starts conversations with random people trying to be all open and free spirited, but the look on 99% of other peoples faces is fear and confusion.   he is a large not so clean looking man (think scum bag steve meme) and I don't mind loud life of the party type people if that is who they want to be, but he just makes everyone feel awkward, and when i'm with him, i feel people look at me and judge me for being his friend.  It all sounds stupid to me as I type this, but he has been my friend for ever, his constant yelling and jersey shore impressions (literally does actual impressions here and he loves the show) and his "trolling" of other people is all like dealing with a child.   I usually ignore it, walk away (unless i'm stuck in his car with him) and stuff like that, but when i'm forced to be around him cause we made plans or are doing work (we work together too) it becomes very energy draining.  The last and final part that has me writing this, he has started to make a lot of gay jokes. First few months i just kinda laughed it off, some guys make gay type jokes with their guy friends, that has never been me, but i'm not about to make someone feel awkward for the way they try to joke around. But his jokes aren't even funny, they are just creepy and weird now, sending me text messages saying he wants to be inside of me... and i can reply with "stop being gay with me man" or something that is honest so he can tell i'm not joking, to which he just carries on his texts more so i ignore him.  I basically am looking for a way to tell him to shut up nicely. i'm very good at saying shit in a mean way, and i really feel like cutting him out of my life forever may be the only option, but maybe someone here has dealt with immature friends like this before.   I also believe he is doing this cause he is a very insecure person, he isn't happy he is over weight, and after a lot of talks about that stuff with him, it was after then a few months that he started talking about how if he thinks better of him self others will too... then this was the result.  ---  **tl;dr**: Best friend of over 10 years read a book and decided dressing and acting like scum bag steve would be cool.  ||||| I think a better way than having a sit-down heart-to-heart with him is to just point out when his behavior is bad. If he yells at a window, say "Stop acting like a fool." If he sends a gay joke, say "I thought you were smarter than that." If he shows up dressed like a chav, ask him why he's dressed like a 12-year-old. He'll get the picture.  ||||| Your last paragraph is likely what everyone will say.  He's probably very insecure about something.  It's hard telling people they're too loud or obnoxious because it really will hurt their feelings.  Just imagine if someone told you "Hey, would you not do (personality trait.)  It's really making everyone uncomfortable."  That would sting a lot.  We have a loud friend.  She's just loud.  She has no volume control.  Which is fine at bars and karaoke, but when we're at a restaurant, we've been asked by the staff to either keep it down or leave.  One guy actually got up and told her she ruined their dinner.  Now, that guy was a dick, but maybe so were we - her friends - for not trying to get her to be quiet.  But how to do that without it seeming like an attack.  I think the only way is to be honest, do it quickly and then just be prepared for the aftermath.  No matter what, they're going to hate it and maybe stop talking to you for a while.  Try your best to make it seem like you're the one who is uncomfortable with their antics and that you've noticed others are.  Use language that isn't pointed at them, but instead on the people they impact; defensive language so they don't feel attacked.  They're going to anyway, but being harsh in this situation is just a last resort. ||||| I had a falling out with a friend in a similar situation...and I blew up in his face and we stopped being friends...but quite honestly, if this behaviour really bothers you and he refuses to stop, you're probably better off without him (which I realized in retrospect regarding my friend). ||||| Me brother went through a similar phase when he started taking anti anxiety meds. I don't have a solution, but maybe writing him a letter would be good to help you understand your thoughts, and to put them in a least offensive way  ||||| It sounds like you've outgrown him as a friend honestly. You can tell him to stop with the gay jokes but approaching strangers and doing Jersey Shore impressions because he likes the show sounds like his personality. It embarrasses you, I get that, but do you really want to stop him from being friendly and entertaining himself just because you're worried about what others think or don't have the same taste?  ||||| > but he just makes everyone feel awkward, and when i'm with him, i feel people look at me and judge me for being his friend.  As they should judge you for the friends you keep.  You say this is a somewhat recent change.  Being his "best friend" it's your place to tell him things he doesn't want to hear.  Lay it on him and he might change.  If he hates you for it, well you did say you feel like cutting him out of your life, so what's the loss.     ||||| To honor your long ass friendship you should atleast talk to him. He's not some random friend- you've known him forever man. If the situations were reversed you probably would've wanted him to call you out on your bullshit.  ||||| Sounds like he likely won't be responsive to a 'heart-to-heart,' as he will most likely accuse you of doing *gay* shit. Truthfully, a person acting this way is so lost and trying to find themselves that they become hard to reason with. In my personal experience, actions speak much louder than words with these people, as listening isn't their strong-suit.   If he is irritating you, if he is embarassing you, start limiting your time with him. Or, if you'd rather not cut back on time spent, try and find 'masculine' ways of telling him to be quiet: "hey dude, tone it down" "chill out, man" etc... find a way of telling him he's overdoing it without sounding needy or whiney, and hopefully it will resonate with him.  ||||| When you are out with him bring up his reasoning for why he might not like himself so much. Tell him you have been thinking about things and you would like to tell him what you DON'T like about him. Those behaviors that are off putting. Tell him that you like him and consider him a friend but they embarrass, and irritate, you so you can only imagine how strangers may feel. Tell him you want him to be happy and like himself and think maybe working on those things will increase his self esteem. ||||| Avoid him as much as possible.  You work together but you're under no obligation to spend any time with him outside of work.  If he asks you to hang out, make an excuse and attempt to limit the time you spend with him as much as possible.  Some time apart may click something in his brain and if he asks why you're avoiding him, then tell him the truth.
9335	1,3,3	6	[deleted] ||||| Considering the amount of times I post this and the feedback I've received from the people who ask "Where do I start?", I'd love to see this comment included in the "Noteworthy Comments" section of the sidebar.  This may not apply 100% to you because you said you have a shop with a lot of tools already but the spirit of the advice still stands.  Anyhoo:  -----------------------------------------------  Here is my go-to advice for any beginnger woodworker.  Here is a great site to get you started: [Woodgears Beginner Page]([URL]  I ate up literally everything I could find.  I spent hours watching The Wood Whisperer, Wood Working for Mere Mortals, Fine Woodworking Beginner series.  Watch and read EVERYTHING you can.  [Here is my Evernote folder of a plethora of good stuff]([URL]  I started building a work bench.  [This workbench]([URL] for which you only need a router, circ saw, and drill.  Since I got a router, I wanted to build a router table, but just something quick and dirty.  So I built [this Minimalist router table]([URL]   It's basically just a slab with a hole and a pivot fence.   Since deciding to get into the hobby, I prowl Craigslist for good deals on tools.  You can use the [Craigslist Notification Chrome Addon]([URL] to set up "saved searches" and get a notification when someone posts a listing that would be a hit on your search.  I found a contractor table saw for $40 and figured why not.  Picked that guy up and then decided to build The Wood Whisperer's style cross cut sled for that.  I've since upgraded to a better table saw, and added a bandsaw and drill press to my kit.   You can also check out [IRS Auctions]([URL] for great deals on used machines.  Now I've got quite a few handcut dovetail attempts under my belt and bought the necessary tools for that task.  I've built a bunch of cutting boards (end and edge), picture frames, and boxes.  I'm finished building an awesome [Morris Chair (here's my LJ blog posts about it)]([URL] and I've got a collection of items for the world of finishing (which is a whole different skillset in and of itself) and growing my finishing tools/supply kit. I've also purchased a book on Box Making Basics and am experimenting with mitered boxes, dovetailed boxes, different lids, panels, etc.  I recently upgraded my folding Ryobi table saw to a Ridgid R4512, got a nice floor standing band saw, a drill press, and a scroll saw.  **SO my advice to you, which you can probably infer, is start with shop projects that you need for your shop.  Do you have a woodworking workbench?  Build one.  Do you have a Cross cut sled?  Build one.  Do y ou have a router table?  Build one.  As you build those things, you'll find out which kind of tools you need.  Once you get some experience with those tools, you'll learn what you can do with those tools.  Then you'll start thinking of things to learn, practice, build, do on your own, organically.**    To me, there are 5 tools that every shop needs to be minimally functional. They are:  Circular Saw, Router, Jigsaw, Random Orbit Sander, and Drill.  The "evolved" versions of these follow when needed/when affordable (Table saw, plunge router/router table, bandsaw, drill press). Buy the rest as you need 'em.  Let your projects lead you into your tools and new projects.  Your tool list and project backlog will happen on its own.  ||||| You are here.

5701	1,3,2	7	Hello, i've bought an Assimil course, from recommendations on here, and i'm struggling with how to actually use the thing! It's Russian, if that makes any difference.  In my book, it has instructions for active and passive phases. I think i understand the passive phase, but after lesson 50, it starts the active phase. I don't actually know what to DO on this phase at all.   It also states that during each lesson, it will give me a previous lesson from the passive phase to review. I've looked through every single lesson from 51-100, and can't see a single piece of writing which says "review lesson 5" or something. I'm just wondering if people can give me some real instructions for the second phase, especially what i'm actually supposed to do, and which lesson from the passive phase it will correspond to. It's really confusing!  Thankyou :) ||||| Hey, i think [this] ([URL] post covers the topic quite nicely! ||||| What edition do you have?

6129	1,3	23	(title really should say the main BACKGROUND/mythology informing the plot of my campaign)  Hey guys, I've been running a story-heavy D&D 4E campaign (soon to be 5E, definitely gonna switch due to the more freeform-ness and potential for much faster, gridless combat etc) in a world of my own creation called Valgard (peep our ObsidianPortal page with pretty detailed wiki here: [URL] for over a year and the party is finally about to reach Paragon tier, and the main elements of the story have started to take center stage with many mysteries starting to unravel etc.  To summarize VERY briefly, the campaign kicked off with mysterious black-masked riders looting an unknown artifact from an ancient elven tomb, and the players following the trail and eventually learning that the masked riders call themselves The Unbroken, since revealed to be a widespread evil cult venerating a mysterious figure known as The Sunderer. The object the Unbroken looted from the tomb was a piece of an ancient ritual tablet/wheel/macguffin (the purpose of which has yet to be revealed) and they are searching for more fragments, all the while abducting people and performing vile experiments on them to perfect the art of Warforging (with various horrifying degrees of success/failure), though their attempts are crude at best compared to the original Warforged (divine legionaries created during the Dawn War by The Sunderer, as detailed below)  Anyway, here is a bit of the overall backstory/campaign arc/goals of the antagonists, and I pretty much am just needing some outside eyes/ears/brains to help make sure there aren't any major contradictions/plot holes/dumbshit ideas in there, since its been revised and rewritten numerous times.          ***  Here ya go:  * Cairoth was a smith god, called The Shaper by his brothers; he was a close friend of Moradin, with whom he shared a love of and aptitude for creation. He was a meticulous craftsman, obsessed with perfection and strength of form, who despised weakness and frailty; he aided the other gods in the creation of the myriad beings that came to inhabit Valgard, but was never satisfied with their results, despairing at the (to his immortal standards) short lifespans and fragile natures of the men and dwarves and elves he helped shape. He longed to create beings that would endure the turning of the ages and carry forth the tales of the magnificent age of creation and the works of the gods.    * After the terrible conflict known as the Dawn War began, Cairoth created the first Warforged by experimenting upon the captured life essences of fallen gods and primordials alike, harvested in secret from the battlefields of the Astral Sea; these essences (in effect their very souls) were stripped of all identity, melted down into a uniform slurry of creation-stuff, and used to power a great forge (which he called the Black Forge) that then birthed living, sentient beings of metal, utterly subservient to their creator. Cairoth hid these methods from the other gods, for he knew they would find them abhorrent.    * Legions of Cairoth's Warforged streamed from his astral domain and bolstered his divine brethren, helping turn the tide of the war and drive the primordials to their ultimate defeat. The gods marveled at these soldiers who obeyed unquestioningly, fought tirelessly, were more durable than even the angelic cohorts and were able to exist in the mortal world for a seemingly unlimited period, unlike the angels and other divine beings whose strength waned and form ultimately faded if they did not return to the Astral Sea.   * In the aftermath of the Dawn War, one of Cairoth's brothers discovered the means by which he had built the Warforged and confronted him; Cairoth slew him in a rage but his victim (whose name has since been forgotten by all but the gods themselves) told Cairoth with his dying breath that he had already dispatched messengers to warn the other gods. Cairoth, knowing he would never be forgiven for this ultimate sin, set upon one last great work; he poured a portion of his own essence and identity into the forge and created an artifact that would allow some part of him to endure should he be slain, as well as grant passage to his domain should it be sealed. He commanded Neraxis, one of his Exarchs, to spirit away this artifact (which he dubbed the Wheel of Dominion) into the mortal world when the domain seemed sure to fall, so he might hide and plot vengeance in time. Then he made his domain ready for the war that would surely soon come.   * The gods laid siege to the domain of their brother Cairoth, whom they named Sunderer for shattering their bonds with his heinous treachery. Eventually, Cairoth's domain was breached and its defenders crushed; the Warforged were all broken and heaped atop one another, forming a mountain of bodies whose summit reached the clouds of Cairoth's realm.    * Cairoth himself was captured; the gods argued then about what his fate should be, and in the end it was decided that too many of their own had fallen between the Dawn War and Cairoth's treachery. Cairoth was imprisoned rather than slain, forced to work the Black Forge one last time, building his own cage of dull black iron, into which he was thrust; Moradin crafted the lock that went on the cage, and keeps the key on a chain around his neck to this day. Cairoth's domain was sealed and abandoned, a desolate and forbidding isle floating through the Astral Sea, the Black Forge long dormant. Cairoth himself dwells caged in the heart of this tomb-like domain, powerless and forgotten.   * Neraxis escaped with the Wheel during the siege, but his desperate flight ended in disaster; damaged from the siege and pursued by angels, the Exarch's essences were bleeding away. The Wheel of Creation was shattered in battle with the pursuing angels, and its pieces scattering across the land when they crossed into the mortal realm. Neraxis, managing to overcome his pursuers, was heavily damaged and forced to enter a state of suspended animation in order to preserve his waning essence so that he might survive. His vessel came to rest in a remote valley, southwest of what would eventually be called Lake Mythras by the men who settled the surrounding lands.    * Many millennia later, almost eight centuries after the event known as The Flood (a magical cataclysm caused by the overthrow and death of the ageless mage-lords that ruled the old Bal-Shanaari Empire, resulting in magic users everywhere going mad and causing decades of strife and a long-lasting stigma towards arcane magic), an elderly hedge witch from nearby Old Talys named Akantha came upon the inert Neraxis while fleeing persecution following the discovery of her talents. The woman was sickly and infirm, and she had been caught performing blasphemous arcane experiments upon vagrants in an attempt to test the efficacy of various spells and rituals she hoped would help her prolong her life and stave off death.     * Akantha studied the looming, vine- and moss-covered figure, and sensing her probing, Neraxis' consciousness stirred. Neraxis reached out and began to whisper into the mind of Akantha, who despaired over the frailty of man and sought a way to become stronger and transcend her mortality. The voice whispered of a new flesh, a flesh of iron that would endure the ages and stave off illness and death. The whispers continued for months until Neraxis had a strong enough hold on Akantha's mind, and he bent her to his will. Through this woman, the cult of Cairoth was born, and the bidding of Neraxis was done. He gathered others to him over time, and they were tasked by their leader to seek out the pieces of the Wheel, so that Cairoth might be freed from his prison. Over the past two centuries, the Unbroken has grown into a shadowy organization with conspirators scattered throughout Aritae, all questing for the hidden artifacts that will allow them to enter Cairoth's forbidden domain and seek a means to bring about the return of their master. Through a combination of Neraxis' knowledge and Akantha's studies of the Exarch, they have also learned a small part of the Warforging process, and have created a number of lesser Warforged (though they pale in comparison to the originals, created from raw god-stuff) as well as discovered the processes by which a living man might replace parts of himself with Warforged elements, growing stronger and sturdier thereby.      ***   **Cairoth/Unbroken/Neraxis Goals**  * Recover fragments and reassemble Wheel of Dominion (currently possessing 6 fragments, out of a total of 13)  * Revitalize/repair/reawaken the dormant Neraxis using essence of Cairoth contained in Wheel fragments  * Harvest mortals to convert into Warforged   * Enter Cairoth's forgotten domain using the reassembled Wheel of Dominion and find a way to free the caged god  * Make war upon the other gods  ***  **Twists**  * Akantha was Melekhemnides' (a player character who is basically Darth Revan in that he was a hugely powerful nearly immortal mage-lord of the old Bal-Shanaari Empire that collapsed 1000 years ago, who survived but had his mind wiped and is now a crazy old hedge wizard, but is slowly regaining his memories) consort, and herself a powerful mage in the Bal-Shanaari Empire who took ill with a wasting disease; she survived The Flood because some years earlier, after a particularly trying bout of illness, Melekhemnides took her to a secret lair he maintained in Talys, placing her in stasis to preserve her so that he could study her illness in the hopes of curing her someday. The Flood weakened her stasis field and eventually it fizzled; Akantha awoke alone in the laboratory/hideout, and after acclimating to her surroundings and discovering the time that had lapsed, set out to finish Melekhemnides' work (which led to her being discovered and subsequently fleeing, and eventually stumbling upon Neraxis)  ***  So...whatcha think, guys? Super convoluted? Interesting?   So far the Warforged (which were not revealed until like 6 levels in) have been a big hit because they are not an established part of the world's lore, so they were a mysterious, Terminator-like enemy. Also lots of awesome minions/human Unbroken with horrid self-forged modifications like robot arms and shoulderbows and shit. The players have enjoyed tangling with these freaks.   ||||| I REALLY like this, and i'm totally gonna borrow it for one of my future campaigns.  One question that came to mind (that the players might not say, but probably think) is how do they know how many fragments there are? It's very original (not that this setting is unoriginal at ALL, i like it very much) to just GIVE the players/cult the number of fragments. Did he count them as they fell? did he have time to do that as he was being attacked and chased off by angels? did he purposefully break the wheel as he fled?  I know my comment is very nit-picky, but the story is so solid. well done.
9282	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	I am hopefully getting a Wii U this Christmas, however I am concerned about the large system update. I have read that the servers willl be really busy, so it is best to avoid updating Christmas day. I am unable to update the Wii U before Christmas, as my Dad is getting it me. I have read that some games have the system update on their disk. Is this true? If so which games have this and how do I go about updating?  Thanks for any replies in advance. ||||| I don't think any games have the current 5.3.2 firmware on it.  You can get kind of close with the on-disc firmware in Captain Toad (5.1.2) or Smash Bros (5.2.0).  I haven't done it myself but if it's like other consoles it will automatically switch to update-from-disc mode if you try to play those games on a console with older firmware.  Is there a reason you need to update immediately?  If not, I'd skip the internet connection and updates during initial setup, play your games on Christmas day, and let it update overnight.  If you go this route, turn off Auto Power-Down so it doesn't shut itself down mid update. ||||| I would assume Smash will have a system update on disc. ||||| you are probably going off old info. the update you are referring to is the large day 1 update that was released 2 years ago when the system launch. the days of having to worry about that update are long gone, as systems have had that update built in for a long time now. ||||| Read the materials in the Wii u box! I just set up a new Wii u and there was a paper in there saying to not set up network connectivity but instead to plug in all the cables, pair the gamepad and then update from disc. After that update is done you can set up the network and it will do the next update online. Count on it taking a couple hours from opening the box to bring fully updated ||||| All games that require a certain firmware should have the firmware on disc.  Pick the most recently released game.  It'll get you closest to current firmware, so your download will be smaller. ||||| I updated my Wii U today and it took about 3 hours with 16k speed. I don't know for sure but i'm pretty sure that the server weren't busy today.

9277	1,3,3,2,3,3,3	27	I have someone selling a wiiu for $100 but there's no gamepad. While not having a gamepad sucks and their crazy expensive (average $150 on eBay) I wouldn't mind buying this if I could just get a pro controller and still be able to do everything minus playing without the tv. Is this possible?  I can borrow a gamepad for any initial set up stuff so that's not a worry. I just don't want to put the money down and then be unable to game on it at all. I've heard mixed things about this so I'm hoping you guys can help me out.  Thanks! ||||| Yeah it is possible to play a game without Gamepad.  But it isn't possible to alter the settings etc...  But yeah... it seems like your plan could work!  But it really is going to be quite cut down on features. Ie no miiverse etc...  When I am gaming on the Wii U I generally dont pick up the gamepad unless its required.  Mario 3d land, Zelda HD, Mario bros U, Need for speed, Tekken, both CODs and maybe Pikmin 3 should all be fine for you. ||||| When possible, I play most games with the pro controller.  In fact, I often leave the gamepad in another room so that it doesn't even turn on.  As /u/longjohndevine said, you won't be able to change settings, and using Amazon Instant Video (as one example) isn't possible with just the pro controller.  Also, you should know that some games allow the use of the pro controller but require the gamepad in certain instances (SM3DW).  That can be a bit frustrating.  Still, from time to time there are some really good deals on the Wii U.  You would not only get the gamepad, but you'd get a new console with a warranty.  You might consider keeping your eyes open and watching for posted deals here in /r/wiiu. ||||| Can u even browse through the tabs on Mao. Menu without the pad? I never used pro controller for main menu stuff yet  ||||| Ah I just noticed could not move around when the pad was on mii verse icon would not move when on tv ||||| $100 might be good for a "second" Wii U in the house, but there are a lot of things that you just can't do without the gamepad, I'd be hesitant if this is your only one.  ||||| No gamepad = no changing console settings = no networking settings = no Internet access at all.

It's great for, well, finding redditors near you!  Seriously, give it a try some time!  ... please?  ;-;  Unfortunately though, there IS an issue with the way I have it set up right now.  Currently, it's set up so that anyone can add themselves at any time.  This makes it a HELL of a lot easier for me, because to be honest there's to many people here for me to keep track of.

6229	1,3,2,3,3	11	As the title says, I'm both A) short (5'5", at last measurement.) and B) young. I'm almost halfway through my Senior year of highschool, and coming up fast on my 18th birthday. At this point in my life, I've gotten by wearing white t-shirts and three year old pants.  But I'd really like that to change. Lately, I've been trying to get ready for adulthood. Budgeting properly, weighing my needs and wants, the whole shebang. So I figured, I should probably try and dress, if not professional, at least a little more mature.

Other than telling you to check the sidebar out, I can give you short guy advice:  Almost all pants will be too long, especially the cool raw ones.  Cuff em well or have them hemmed.    sizes get confusing if you're skinny and short, try figuring out your measurements to make it a little bit easier.  apparently some clothes can make you look shorter, but I am not sure how it works.    pretty much all I've got so far, feel free to ask.  ||||| go slim. avoid horizontal stripes. lose the belt when possible. narrower shoes.  make sure your clothes don't bunch up at your wrists and ankles. you want to avoid breaking the vertical rhythm of your outfits.
3724	1,3,3	4	Starting at a big west coast tech company next week and I want to do everything I can to get a full time position. Anyone got any tips? I felt like I have read something like this on here before, but a search yielded nothing. Thanks! ||||| In the tech sector internships are first and foremost a tool for hiring. The decision when hiring an intern isn't, "is this person smart enough to be worth $X/hour over the summer", the decision is, "would we hire this person in a year and a half?"   You're past the side projects, cracking the code interview, resume optimization, white board coding phase. Be a good employee and you'll get an offer. ||||| Sometimes the internships don't offer full time positions after. My recommendation would be to look into people that have been at your position before at the company.
9343	1,3,2,3	8	Recently, I have gotten interested in worlds consisting of infinite flat planes. yes, I know I would have to get rid of space exploration and all that goes with it, but having a world like this would mean that there would be infinite land exploration, the frontier never ends,  empires could could stretch farther than they ever could on earth. Life would evolve in isolated pockets on the plane, and things from entirely different evolutionary trees could end up meeting.  I'm the kind of person who needs an explanation for these kind of things, even if it is just hand waving and pseudoscience. so here is my explanation for my world:  First, I need a way for the universe to actually form in a way that creates such a plane. here is how I explain it:  First imagine a world with 2d space, and have it folded so it produces a crease. It would end up looking like this:  [URL]  matter would be attracted toward the crease and form a line down the middle.   Now, lets do the same with 3D space, and folding it through a fourth dimension.   [URL]  This would create a 2D "crease" which would attract matter to form a plane. This requires the assumption that matter only responds to gravity, but doesn't create it, or it would collapse into spheres which would be attracted towards the crease. I couldn't find a way to get around it, so i'm just taking away matter induced gravity.   Now that we have our plane, lets find a way to make it habitable. obviously, we can't have traditional suns, so we have to have something else. here is what I came up with:   "Due to the contorted nature of the universe, there is what seems like a wall of light and heat emanating from above the plane. The heat and light is actually a portal to another universe caused by part this universe, poking into the other, where the amount zero point energy is enough to heat the plane up to a habitable temperature. The geometry of the portal means that the emissions are on average spread evenly, but there are areas where temperatures are low enough for heat to radiate away, as well as areas that are hotter than normal, creating massive amounts of convection. Only the areas between these zones are habitable, as the warm zones are scoured clean by perpetual rain from huge cumulonimbus clouds, and the cold zones are freezing wastelands."   You may be asking about how all of the materials got here. this is probably my biggest piece of hand waving and nonsense yet. I got the idea from quantum mechanics. Given an infinite amount of time, quantum fluctuations could cause anything to appear. In this version of the universe, a specific proportion of elements spontaneous appeared which sorted out by density and chemical reactions until the plane formed, much like early earth but completely flat.  Edit: If the quantum fluctuations didn't turn out like this, the story wouldn't be about the universe where it didn't. it would be about one that did.    That is the story of the beginning of my world, it probably wont be to important to the history of nations and such, but I think explanations are an important part of a world.     ||||| I love your drawings. The first time I have seen a flat world with a decent scientific background. ||||| As someone else who has an infinite world but couldn't come up with such a great explanation, would you mind if I used this? ||||| It's a great idea. I've always liked the idea of a flatworld. Fantasy demands a higher scope than the surface area of a single meagre planet. I had the idea of a fantasy setting on the inside of a dyson sphere with an area 500 million times greater than the surface of the earth. But your world would be much much bigger than that of course. 
6702	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,2	40	In games where I have a body, my body looks tiny. In Live for Speed my arms are tiny and the car is tiny. In Sightline the Chair when I look down at my legs, lift the rift off my face and look at my own legs, the VR knees go about half way down my real legs. Its like im 3 or 4 feet tall.  And as amazing as Half Life 2 is.. the scale looks way off. It feels like i have a giant head on a small body. If i look down at the floor in game, its HIGHER feeling/looking than my own floor, AND IM SITTING DOWN. It should look way below my real floor, not higher. My gun in HL2 appears fairly well in scale to my head, but as soon as i get close to another character, my gun is like the full height as them! It looks huge compared to their bodies.  And before you say it, yes my IPD and height is set correctly in the Oculus config util. My IPD has been measured in many ways, including at an eye glasses place.  One thing ive noticed is that when i change my height from 6'1 to 6'0 in the Oculus util, suddenly the table in the demo scene is much larger. It normally looks like a tiny kids table. Why would a 1 inch difference make such a huge difference in perspective?  I think theres some bugs in this area and Im kind of shocked that I havent seen much talk about this on here. Ive seen the odd person in youtube videos mention it the odd time, but generally its ignored.  Can we have a discussion about this and others chime in about this topic please? It is not going to get fixed if we dont report it. ||||| In Elite the body seems ridicoulus small. Almost like a child.  Edit: Did some testing, Elite is not using the IPD setting from the config util. :/ ||||| Is it because I am tall and skinny in real life? I am 6'1 but only have an IPD of 63.5. Could I be messing up the algorithms that determine how I look ingame because I am an outlier in height vs eye spacing? ||||| I've heard that sitting down while playing a game where you character is standing makes the scale feel weird too. ||||| Paul bettner talks about scale 5.10 onwards   [URL]  not sure its relevant to this but interesting none the less(also love the alien isolation screams in the background)  ||||| Mate I have exactly the same problem. Exactly. I have to lower the IPD to crazy low settings, but then often I lose stereoscopy.   I measure my IPD as 64 in the tool, and at the optometrist, but when I set it to 64 things always feel too small - I believe they call it "toy-ification" and it is apparently a known phenomena with stereoscopic 3d in some settings - as the stereoscopy effect gets stronger but the scale of everything gets smaller - apparently to do with the convergence and depth of the rendered scene - so maybe its something weird about how we experience convergence or even depth perception ?   When you could do it (ie pre-DK2), I had a range of configs in the oculus util down to 8mm - when something did work with the config I found that the 8mm setting was the best for me ie scale felt best.  The new vireio drivers (2.03) were good because they had a real time IPD offset so skyrim was much better with them (on DK1, anyways) - because you could lower the world scale settings, then use the IPD offset and the convergence settings to get it about right, but even then I was always at the very lowest end of the world scale settings. I hope oculus or software developers put real time IPD offset and convergence settings into everything (ie their SDK etc) but also hard coded into software so that people can configure it for themselves on the fly rather than having to dick around measuring it before hand etc (and putting arbitrary limits about how low it can go for people like us) - and can just naturally find what scale suits them best.  Btw, I do not have  a tiny head or anything :), in case thats what you were thinking.  It's definitely weird huh. We should start our own support subreddit wherein we talk about "IPD privilege". ||||| Sense of scale is a known issue. It is more of a perception problem.  [Relevant reddit thread]([URL] ||||| Do you wear strong glasses? Maybe that could play a role. The oculus desk demo especially should especially look correct scale to real life objects if your ipd is configured properly. If not, try to compare to a real life pencil or soda can to desk demo, does it looks the same size when you take the hmd off? ||||| >If i look down at the floor in game, its HIGHER feeling/looking than my own floor, AND IM SITTING DOWN.  That's because in HL2 your character is standing. No matter how you reset the positional orientation of your head, it's centering it on the head of a body that is standing.  Trying playing HL2 standing up and see if you feel a difference.  Though the rest of your issues do sound odd. The table demo's table seems perfectly normal to me while sitting down. Height set to 6'2. ||||| You can set your IPD outside the range of the config util by hacking on your profile data file directly. Don't have the path right now, but it might help with your experimentation. Also note that very small IPDs will effectively make the scene monoscopic. When you remove stereoscopic cues, other cues take over, so that's probably why it seemed better. ||||| The fact that it looks like "your chin is on the ground" when Gordon crouches in HL2 seems to point to some sort of mis-adjusted camera issue.  (Perhaps the camera is so high that it senses that your head is very low, and renders things accordingly.)  One would assume that you'd have calibrated things correctly in at least *one* of those games, however, so that's a puzzler.  I'd normally suggest one of these three fixes, but I think you've already tried them all:  1. Set your IPD to a lower value.  2. Stand up when "playing" standing avatars.  3. Make sure your camera is positioned and "re-centered" properly.  (Does HL2 even support positional tracking?)  You seem to be complaining about two separate issues, simultaneously.  One, you feel like things in the world are too small, or your head is too big.  That's a **scaling** problem.  But you also say that your viewpoint is too low, almost touching the floor when crouching.  That's an in-world **position** issue, if it's really as you describe.  Do other people see things the same way when viewing these games in your DK2? ||||| Went to school for game development, though it's not my current industry. We were taught that true scale actually looks wrong in most games, and it's true if you're not talking about VR. You have to exaggerate in a lot of funny ways or players will think it looks wrong.  It's hard to think that every scale problem could be resolved in most games, and I'm not even sure camera adjustments would be that easy. But, I feel like you've stumbled on what may become one of the most popular complaints with CV1. ||||| i think just like how a lot of people will not hear audio problems or musical notes being off, the same thing goes for video as well. just as theres audiophiles, theres also videophiles, and specifically 3d videophiles.  i really dont know how to put this without sounding like im bragging or putting others down, but ive had my iq tested by a psychiatrist and the visual/spacial portion of the test was off the chart. the dr hadnt seen anyone score so high before (175 or something). so my ability to see and understand objects in 3d space may be more sensitive than others.  plus you may need to use the same ipd/height as me to see the problems as well, as i noted that changing them even slightly had a large effect ingame. ||||| LFS feels pretty good to me... ||||| What is you resolution set at?
5230	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3	33	Since the start of this season i've faced what seems to be nothing but Reno Jackson decks. Whether they be RenoLock, Reno Freeze mage or Reno Paladin. I have been mainly playing Oil Rogue the past few seasons and I'm finding it very difficult to counter these decks unless I get perfect draws? Any tips?  TL;DR how do you beat reno? ||||| By beating them before Reno, or doing 59 damage to them.   ||||| As mill rogue, all Reno does is let them survive to 12 fatigue damage per turn instead of 7. ||||| Just try not to play a deck that has a finite amount of damage (like oil rogue, freeze mage, etc) or try to play something that will just kill them before Reno.  Or...  Play rogue with double beneath the grounds :)  NinjaEdit : Forgot to mention you can also play a deck that has a combo win condition (like any Malygos deck). They can't Reno if you kill them in one turn. ||||| Loving this time right now (RenoLock here) only because it's killing the aggro game and secret pally isn't a problem. I'm only super happy after my opp has said sorry each turn and well played repeated when I'm at 3 health only to lifetap, get a sorry from the opp again, and then reno to him threatening.  That all being said TIPS FOR BEATING RENO AND AS A ROGUE!: Yes this deck is frustrating but I've been trying to figure out counters. Rogue is the way to go for a good reason: Beneath the Grounds. If you run 2, you can get one off and shuffle three copies into their deck thus killing reno for a bit. Pop the 2nd, then its 6 copies and you get a 4/4 while he draws. As the player you need to realize when it is a Reno deck and not "burst" all your cards at once. Reno wins against aggro because players are using their entire hands then top decking once their opp has regained control, health, and is now dropping 7+ mana drops. ||||| Oil Rogue has a really tough time dealing with Reno since the amount of damage in the deck is fairly limited. If Reno is what you're seeing the most, I'd recommend switching to a deck with a more minion-based strategy. ||||| If you play Aggro you beat them before they draw reno. If you play control, your card quality should be higher and you should win the game regardless of a big heal that doesn't affect the board. ||||| Play Midrange Combo Druid.  The deck absolutely farms Reno decks because the minion quality is much higher and you can easily burst them with a huge combo.  It's not uncommon for them to heal to 30 and then just die the next turn because they spent 6 mana for a 4/6 instead of clearing your board. ||||| Play a little like you do against Handlock.  When you're fighting a Handlock you know that if you bring them too low, they're going to drop Moltens, taunt up, and maybe even toss in a Healbot to add insult to injury.  So instead you bring them to a certain point and burn them out in one turn.  The same applies to Reno, except there's no specific number to work around and you don't need to stop attacking face.  You just don't want to blow any kind of burst damage until you can kill them in one turn, especially in a deck with finite and specific damage.  Now, some decks just don't have any burst either due to class cards or lack of room for them.  The way to fight Reno with one of these decks is to make it so Reno won't save them.  For instance, as Flood Zoo you can lay out a board full of minions, Reliquary Seekers, and top it off with Loatheb.  Now it doesn't really matter if he drops Reno or not, it didn't do anything about your winning board state.  That said, if you're playing Oil Rogue, you should easily be able to build up ~15 damage of burst in hand.  Oil Rogue is particularly favored against most variants of Paladin since healing doesn't prevent burst, only armor does, and Rogue has many answers to Silver Hand Recruits.  I can't imagine this changes against Reno Paladin when played correctly.  The bottom line is, a Reno deck seeks to win through either value or fatigue.  Rogue can't win either of these games.  You have to take control and make the game about tempo, because if you start making anti tempo plays, you hand the advantage back to your Reno opponent. ||||| I just want to bask in the glory of this problem!  No offense to the OP, but for us control players, we have waited a long time for this! ||||| It has begun... once fun and original, now the complain train has started, 2 month and we are at the "blizzard doesnt care" stage ||||| Set up a decent board and aim to OTK, its like playing against face hunter you have to establish board control ||||| I haven't made any changes to my [[Bloodlust]] Shaman deck since reno.  Healing for 20 is useless if I'm going to double bloodlust and hit them for 30 the next turn anyway. ||||| Hope they don't clear your board when they play it. ||||| You can't beat them with Oil Rogue. You have limited amount of damage output, and Reno fucks that up. Same goes with Control Warrior. ||||| Just play secret paladin with turn 3 and 4 muster turn 5 quartermaster ezzz kappa
3251	1,3,3,3	13	Hi r/buildaPC!  I've been wanting to build my own PC since the summer and I finally have the funds and the opportunity to it. I'm just looking for some tips and second opinions on my build so far, given my restrictions below.

I initially wanted mATX but I'm pretty sure that mITX is a better option now. For this reason I'm going with EVGA's Hadron Air. I'm looking for other case options if you have an idea but please also suggest a PSU since the Hadron comes with its own.  *CPU & Mobo:* I'm choosing Z97 chipset so that I can upgrade more easily to something a little better in the future. Also the added Wifi is a bonus. For now though, I'm pretty curious to see for myself how the G3258 will do, given it's great price. I mostly play Guild Wars 2, Minecraft, Skyrim and Planetside 2. I think Planetside 2 will be the most demanding thing I'll be doing with my system (maybe some CAD or 3D design work later) and I would like to be able to play it at least fairly well - 1080p, High, ~60 FPS - I don't need Ultra.  *Budget:* My budget was initially $650-700 (pre S&H and taxes) when I was not thinking about size but after realizing I'd probably need mITX, my budget is $750 CAN (before shipping and taxes and MIR)  In the future, I'd like to add an SSD, install an aftermarket CPU cooler and upgrade the CPU and/or GPU  Thanks for reading this far! I'll answer any questions or comments you have below :)  P.S. Is is mITX or just ITX? ||||| I think your graphics card will be capable of 60FPS at High 1080p, so a good choice there. The Pentium can be overclocked, but since you currently have the stock cooler I wouldn't take it too far. However, I'm no expert on overclocking so I suppose my opinion is a bit invalid. I like your case. It's the one I'll be getting, so I'm a bit biased towards it. :) I think you've got a solid system on your hands.  Note: The motherboard is renowned for having rather breakable wifi-antennas. Be careful. ||||| ITX is basically just a shorter way of saying Mini-ITX.  You should recheck available GPU pricing , you can definitely get more for your money.

831	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	12	[deleted] ||||| I highly recommend just raising to 1600-1800 trophies and doing mostly dragon-centric raids.  I reached TH 8 only about a week ago, but I had a lvl 4 barb king.  I spent one week in the trophy range and got about 80k DE, getting 4 levels and a minion upgrade (which I also highly recommend doing).  Also if you're still TH 7 and you run into a Th 10 with at least 40k DE you can steal 4k at once.  Although it's not likely that you'll get to it you can triple lightning spell it.  At level 4 lightning spells I would get 1500-1600 DE from spelling those.  Don't feel pressured to do this, a friend of mine did the gem method, but I did the 5th builder which was also probably the best buy I ever did.  Good luck with whatever you do choose :) ||||| It's not that hard to go up in trophies and lightning strike DE storages and do all dragon raids for DE. I'd save gems for a 5th builder, you don't need it now. But it'll help so much when you do. It shouldn't take more than 2 days of all dragon raids to get 10k ||||| I wouldnt recommend it, I have a th7 also and i got a barb king lvl 2 and minions lvl 2, all I have been doing is looking for people with 3-6k de and using my lightning spells on it (make sure you can get the th also) or I just use a all out dragon raid and take it all. My trophy range that I got my barb king/minions were 1200-1600. ||||| Gemming the barb king is the easy way out, if you start DE farming right now as a TH7, it will be easier when you reach TH8 and above. ||||| I wouldn't. It feels great working to get the king. Also you need to learn how to farm dark elixer anyway or your king will stay at lvl 1. ||||| No. ||||| Unless you're going to buy the other 1000 gems, you aren't going to get that 5th builder any time soon.   However, if you're already going to TH8, you might as well build the DE collector, level it to 3, and wait while also collecting DE from raids. The BK is an excellent unit, but your army won't suffer *that* much without him. And you'll probably won't be able to bring yourself to use him all that much.
6667	1,2,3,3,3,3	7	I would like to preface this post by saying I'm not some lazy, panicky stoner looking for an easy way out.  Hello! I'm a student studying nutrition in university. Being only a minor, though, I have some questions for some perhaps more seasoned members of the community. I was just curious if anyone had a resource or maybe some tips on detoxing? I'd like to try and get as much out of my body as I can in a week. I've gathered what I can through youtube and google, but I'm curious what you all may have to say.  My plan of attack is this:   * keep carbs, fats, and overall caloric intake low. (a lot of leafy veggies, less sugary foods and bready carbs, snacks will be cans of tuna, a lot of egg whites, avoid sodium)  * don't overdo the protein, however.  * drink plenty of water.  * drink a cup of black coffee every morning.  * bike and lift a lot in long-sleeved shirts.  * keep the temp. high in my room and wear heavy pj's (more sweating).  * sauna or steam room because why not?  * avoid alcohol and dehydration.  Example of my day yesterday would be 4.5 mile bike, a 12 inch sub from subway (turkey, ham, lettuce, jalapenos, mayo, american cheese, cucumbers --- not the best, I know), and a bowl of broccoli. Handfuls of granola through the day if I just needed a little weight in my stomach. I think I had, like, 2 or 3.   Again, if you read this, I'd like to thank you. The last thing I want to seem like is some schumck who's desperate for an easy detox to get his ass out of trouble. I'm a hard working person who recently landed in a bit of hot water. I'm taking my plan very seriously so far. I'm really gunning hard to make these amends.  Throwaway because I've given my school name and info out on my real account. ||||| What exactly are you trying to detox out of your body? ||||| Essentially you're dehydrating yourself. Sauna + heated room with long pjs + exercise in long sleeve shirts. Really?  There's nothing you can do that will make your kidneys or liver filter things out quicker than is standard for your body.  You could actually concentrate any chemical disqualifiers by forcing so much water out of your body.  This is a dumb move for your short term health.  Drink water. Maybe go easy on the fats, depending on the solubility of the things that would disqualify you. Don't partake in the activity that go you here in the first place. ||||| I'm sure your local grow shop, dispensary, or corner gas station would have an abundance of relevant advice. You could try /r/trees, too. Also, I'm fairly certain that if its a hair test you're going to be pretty much effed until your hair has grown enough so that you can cut off the tainted layer of hair.         ||||| OP, listen to /u/tctu's advice, and check out /r/trees. Or visit your local headshop and get some of that fake Gatorade stuff that helps you pass tests. ||||| Juice fast, water fast, dry fast or any combination.  If you do fast, make sure you get enough salt.

8402	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	Just had a wonderful ticket come up from our help desk.  Summary: Customer is having issue on the electric port on his desk that it is not giving out electricity  A few of the logged comments state that user stated that a few other people seem to be having an issue too. Being it is the end of my day and the ticket volume has been relatively small, I go to the user's desk to investigate just in case it's something silly like bad power cords or whatnot. I get up there and apparently one whole row of cubes are without power and this fool decides to call the IT help desk because he can't be bothered to find the number for maintenance. When I tell him there's nothing I can do, he just stares blankly at me and asks why. I pointed out the number for maintenance on the same page as our help desk number and told him to call.  Now I'm sitting here contemplating whether to QA the help desk agent from a nation on an island that sits somewhere between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean.  TLDR: If the bathroom lights don't turn on, call IT. ||||| Experienced a similar scenario.  The power in the entire building went out and we have a backup generator but for some reason it didn't kick in. So they drag me out to see if I can "take a look" because I "fix things."  ||||| Let's see... I've been asked to revive a dead Tamagotchi, fix a dead kettle in the kitchen, oil door hinges, tape programs on the office VCR... apparently I.T. covers anything with metal in it. ||||| On a related note, being an electrical engineering student doesn't make me a qualified electrician. No, I will not rewire your breaker box...  Edit: a word ||||| Two similar calls.  The first was an ancient space heater that overloaded and melted the power strip it was in causing the breaker to trip.  The second was a 50 year old in floor outlet that had shorted out and actually blew a hole through the brass casing.  Both times, must be an IT problem. ||||| 'Hello, IT.'   'It's not working. Fix it.'   'What isn't working?'   'The light. Fix it.'   '... (gunshot)' ||||| I've had calls about a toaster, refrigerator and coffee machine not working when I was desktop support for a call center. I guess it was easier to complain to me since my office was right around the corner than it was to find the maintenance guy. ||||| One day we had a blackout in the plant. Networking and phones stayed mostly functional but most computers died (outside of laptops and a few machines with a UPS attached). The phone started ringing off the hook to fix their computer immediately. My answer was the same repeated snarky answer, "Are the lights on above you?" "Nooo, there's a power outage. Someone announced it over the paging system. Can you fix my computer?" "Only if you can fix the power first ..." *click*  One person even found a laptop so they could submit a ticket letting us know that their computer wasn't working. *sigh*  This happens every time we lose power ... Every ... Single ... Time.  Blah.  Apparently I have a ticket waiting that wants me to look at the soda machine in the break room. That is why I have the maintenance system's ticket submission email address assigned as a tech ... Reassign to Maint N. Ence and done. ||||| The best part about it is the location I work at is *the* computer center for the entire company.

5035	1,2,2,3,3,3,3	27	So like most of the people here, I do love the look of handsewns. I have worn them from many different companies, including some of the higher-end ones. My problem, however, is that after about 6 months, they become slippers for me. If they're unlined, which they usually are, they lose a lot of their shape, especially in the toe. I'd say the height of the toebox decreases by about half. All of the sudden, they look much more casual than when I bought them. I know they're inherently a casual style but I find it difficult to wear them to the very very business casual environment I work in. I'd be more than happy to plunk down 300 dollars on rancourts, if I knew that over the years they could maintain their shape after all the shit I'll put them through. Does anyone have any similar experience, or possible solutions? I've tried highland with walkover, and those basically became blobs after a few months. Is Rancourt better?  ||||| Do you use shoe trees in them? ||||| Can you upload a picture perhaps?   I've owned Highland and cheaper llbeans and they both age similarly. In my opinion, they look better with age and more casual (not to mention more comfortable). I think it's just the way an unstructured moc toe ages. They wrinkle and mold to your feet and crease and become yours.  ||||| You could order a lined version of the Rancourt shoes, that would help with keeping the shape. I also echo everyone else with the shoe trees; if you want your shoes to maintain shape, you should have a pair of shoe trees in them when they're not in use. You should also probably avoid the CXL models, since that's a stretchier and less structural leather. ||||| If you're using shoe trees, perhaps you should stop using them. ||||| If you get a pair of Rancourts, when you have to get them resoled, I'm sure they could relast them if the uppers are losing their shape as you mentioned.  Could help a little, but probably depends on how much they've stretched.  Seems a little strange to me though, I've never had that issue ||||| I have the same problem

6218	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3	18	I've asked a girl to hang out twice, and both times she said she was busy with work and school. Today is Saturday, so its a good day to hang out.   On the other hand, I have a week off work and can do whatever. The only downside is she may have school.   The reason is we've hung out before, and me and her really hit it off, so I was going to ask her out if the right moment appeared.  ||||| Go for it. But also realize that if you've asked her out several times and she's always busy, she may be letting you down easy. As someone else said, if she wants to hang, she'll make herself available. You want to hang out with [Fuck Yes People]([URL] not finnicky or lukewarm people. ||||| I would wait. You don't want to seem pushy, maybe later on you can ask, if she hasn't asked yet.  ||||| Don't do it. She was just trying to let you down easy. If she was really interested, she wouldn't have responded with "I'm busy with school," it would have been more like "I'm busy with school tonight but how about this weekend?" So you've got your answer.   Good on you for trying though! Hopefully the next one won't go so rough.    ||||| 3 strikes. Ask and then bounce if she says no again ||||| ASK HER TO HANG OUT SEIZE THE MOMENT CARPE DIEM ||||| How much time in between the two times you asked her to hang out? ||||| Have you spoken with her much since you last asked her out?  The general rule is that if you ask a girl out and she is legitimately interested but busy, she'll make an effort to find another time or will really make it clear that she does want to go out.  Otherwise, it's a non-confrontational "no thanks."  Of course, there are exceptions and girls can be just as oblivious about such things as guys. But you're right on the edge at this point.  I'd probably let it ride and see if she ever brings it up.  If she does go for it. ||||| I'd say go for it, but try to do a bit more planning this time. So instead of saying "Hey, let's hang out today," say "Hey I feel like doing a happy hour/movie/concert/lunch/whatever, you around this week?" ||||| Ok.  Unless you regularly spend time with someone, you shouldn't ask them out for the same day.  This is problematical for 2 reasons.  1) Even if she is interested in hanging with you, she may actually have plans or be busy with other things and not be able to move them/adjust her schedule.  Now, you're stuck not knowing whether her not hanging with you is because she's not interested or because you weren't considerate enough to give her warning.  2) It makes it seem like your hanging out isn't very important to you.  e.g. you're just calling her because you don't have anything else to do or anyone else to do it with.  Instead of it being because you really want to spend time with her.  No one wants to be someone else's backup plan.  If this was someone you routinely spent time with, that wouldn't be an issue.  And spur of the moment plans can be fun/romantic/exciting so it isn't always a hard rule but it's a good general one.    What you should do is ask her out for sometime later this week or next weekend.  If she turns you down with the same "busy" excuse, you can say something along the lines of, "We spent time together before and I thought we really sort of hit it off.  But I've asked you out two other times and you said you were busy then, too.  If you just aren't interested in hanging with me, that's OK.  Just tell me so, and I'll stop asking you out.  If you are interested, then tell me a time that works for you."  
869	1,3,3,3	4	I'd be interested in hearing your opinions about what you think the direction of art education will be. I have friends who study and teach graphic design and are big proponents of a new atelier model which I find intriguing. Basically it consists of a small group of students who are sent to a certain location with a certain task ( for instance, move to Rio and create a campaign for a line of detergent). The idea being that we live in a more open world where one's ability to navigate cultural concerns is quite important. Not to mention the "hands on" approach which more and more design students are demanding. So this got me to thinking about the state of art education and where it is headed. It's easy to forget that the Academy model is actually quite new, and I don't see any reason why it would change. Does anyone know of these travel/work/study programs in Fine Arts? It seems like it could be an interesting way to study since it would give access to something which would in a way resemble an artist residency, but with feedback as well as a clear goal.  ||||| I think art education will become more academic. Figuration and abstraction circulate in cycles.  ||||| In k-12 it will be (already is becoming) Teaching for Artistic Behavior.

5578	1,3	5	Hi, I was wondering if anyone has made or knows of an offline web application for file management and localStorage.  I am looking for something that can load files into localStorage, delete files from localStorage, and can rename files in localStorage.  Hopefully it can compress locally stored files, show file sizes, and show hashsums.  For the purposes of my project, it has to have the ability to be completely offline, but there is no problem if it has the ability to load files from a remote website.  Does this exist?  I tried searching Google and the JQuery registry, but I don't know any other great ways to search for it. ||||| no, youll have to piece it together yourself but heres some tips:  - possibly you can use file upload widget (<input type=file>?), once they choose something it is possible to read the file   - you can search like read file from upload html @ stackoverflow - localStorage has to be json stringified i believe - while i wouldnt recommend it, atob() and btoa() are the base64 encoding/decoding functions for console... upload form might give you base64 data (i forget sorry), or maybe you have to base64 encode the json stringify - so maybe something like `localStorage['file1'] = JSON.stringify(btoa(filedata))`  [URL] has a section on reading files.

(specifically some 60 card 'one of each card only' type decks.)  but I need them all at the same power level so that getting a certain deck doesn't mean a certain win.   Any tips besides play testing a ton? ||||| Although you might be able to get them fairly even without testing, I'm afraid the only way you are gonna for sure is to play them against each other. If you don't want that hassle of remaking the decks with actual cards, try using the play testing features of tappedout. Apart from that, a good start would be having the same ratio of land to creatures to instants/sorcery's in each deck. ||||| Keep in mind rarity is not necessarily equivalent to power.  Path to Exile, Aether Vial, Kitchen Finks, Skullclamp, and Lotus Petal were all at least initially printed at uncommon or common.

Each deck has between ~4-8 rares and ~10-14 uncommons (With the rares, If one particular rare is essential to how the deck runs, I have a full play set of that card. You can't have an Ink-Treader Nephilim deck without 4 Ink-Treaders, amirite). It all comes down to synergy and how each card plays in its deck.

1035	1,3,3,1,3,3	6	As many of us know, invoker current status is... not the best for the game. I was thinking a way to rework the hero, I know is hard and maybe imposible, being one of the signature heroes of Dota I mean is THE invoker, but considering the path of tweaks and changes in the last time has been basicaly "Buff QW -> Nerf QW buff QE -> Nerf QE buff QW" we may need another solution.  I will bring what Dendi Said about the current invoker in the recent AMA:  >I dislike it a lot . Actually i didn't like invoker the version before too , when he used to build up NECRO3 everygame and just go mass summons build . I think invoker is extremely micro depended and hard hero to play . And he suppose to get the most reward for it in the game . But nowdays invoker Q/W is just way **too simple and strong** and any mediocore player can play it well . lasthit creeps ? run fast ? cast 2 spells ? well done. About SUMMONER invoker , same thing ! it was just way too easy . Farm , play defensive , summon forge+necro and it was almost impossible to fight against that . What invoker suppose to be - **CAST SPELLS , CAST THEM SMART , CAST THEM FAST**  One of the things I really like about invoker is cast skills (check Invoking invocations for reference), for that I go for a fast lvl 17 and scepter, but is seems that invoker isn't about that as absourd as it may sound, the usual and safe invoker path is going for 1 build with a set of skills that you will use for the rest of the match that mean QW or EQ basically, going the casting invoker means snowballing or going late game where invoker lose a bit of power (risky).  SO, what to do ? I would like to see a casting invoker once for all, a invoker where you don't need to choose a build that you will follow to the end of the game. How can we do this ? I don't know, but I have 1 Idea to start with, the clue point of this is this:  * Lower the CD of invoke, this is one of the main reason why you have to chose 3 skills over the course of 1 team fight for the first 20-30 min. you need to wait to lvl 17 without aghs to be more versatile.   But we have a problem now, having a 10/5/2 second cd early game can be problematic for balance. Even though Having a wide amout of weak skills isn't that bad but still need to be resolved. I will go with my idea now:  * 12 second CD lvl 1 invoke * "Nerf" (rescale) all invoker skills * Orbs no longer increase power of skills (just stats and bounuses, so if you want to go fast pick W and so on). * The scaling of the skills now depend of invoke lvl. (that would make it 4 scaling hero like every one else) * Leveling up a orb reduce invoke lvl 0,5 seconds * Scepter removes mana cost of invoke and give invoker the "normal" pre nerferd skills.  So basically a lvl 25 invoker now and this would be almost the same, the only difference would be the early game where you don't need to choose QW or QE or why not EW (easier to balance?) and makes the balance of all invoker you will be able to use more than 3 skils early game. having a 8,5 cd on invoke lvl 9 sound great for me.  So I tried my best to get my arguments clear, Now I don't know what you think, Leave your ideas too. Sorry for long post.   ||||| The hero is fine he isn't too op because you can just buy a bkb or gank him early on to shut him down. ||||| Invoker is fine,only Mana Burn need to be nerfed everything else with that hero is perfectly fine. ||||| I agree that a more variety based invoker would be more fun overall, and require more skill, but I think that could be accomplished simply by rescaling him so that he excels in late game, rather then reworking him. ||||| You're getting downvoted but as an avid 5K Invoker player I agree. He's far too boring as it is right now. I think the idea with having his skills scale based on Invoke is a good idea.   The issue is that Invoker isn't a bad hero. Look at Phoenix and TB, Brood, and how many remakes they've gone through. Invoker might have to go through those as well if he gets remade. That's the biggest issue right now regarding what CAN be changed.  I think Invoker should be balanced around a 4/4/4 orb build. As it is now, Invoker is all about extremes. Go EMP build and wipe a whole team's mana pool, or go Exort and you're all about damage and shitty team fight.  With a 4/4/4 build you can EMP a team without burning their whole mana pool, you can use Meteor Blast without obliterating someone completely, and you have forge spirits that don't solo kill the enemy team. But for this we need much lower Invoke CD and I'd warrant removing the mana cost to Invoke, or having it go from 80 > 60 > 40 > 20 > 0 (maybe go 40 > 30 > 20 > 10 > 0) as opposed to 20 > 40 > 60 > 80 > 0 ||||| I stopped reading at a "fast 17".

This means the typical order of method calls is the following:  measure() onMeasure() layout() onLayout() draw() onDraw()  There are exceptions (for instance a ViewGroup instance with the "willNotDraw" property set to true will see a call to dispatchDraw() instead of draw/onDraw).  Also note that the measure pass is optional.  I'd be happy to help you more if you have more specific questions. ||||| You might enjoy this video, starring a fellow commenter in this thread 😋  [URL] ||||| Something fun about onMeasure...  It's stated by the API when you make a custom view, you MUST call onMeasure, or an exception will be thrown showing your custom view.  However, this is not true.  What happens is EVERYTHING below your custom view simply disappears. No exception. Just silent fail.  I consider the Android API incomplete for this reason and many others.

8678	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3	14	This was actually last night, but I just now realized I should share.  I normally only shave when my facial hair gets so long that I start to get beard in my food. I'd try to style it somehow, but it's unruly and grows in sorta patchy, despite growing in a decent length.   Whenever I do shave, I always make it a habit to jokingly give myself a Hitler mustache. Because, y'know. Sometimes I wanna know what I'd look like as the tyrant of the early 1940's. Also, when I shave, I use disposable razors. Shaving is a rare occurrence for me (once every few months or so), so I don't spend a lot on expensive razors. Usually the cheapest tri-blade throw-away works for me.  I was on my last razor.  So I shaved everything but the Hitler 'stache, and went about to fixing up the rest of my face. I got most of it, save for a few patches that needed cleaning up. This is when I noticed that the blades were getting really dull. So dull that they were no longer cutting at all (hence the patches). Oh well, I'll just go into the medicine cabinet and get another razor.  BUT HARK! There are no more razors! This was the last one. And it's too dull to shave with at all. And here I am, with a patch of hair on the left side of my jaw, and a quite obvious Hitler mustache.  I need to fix this. I have work in the morning. But I have nothing to fix this with. I can NOT go to work like this.   I decide that the best option, at this point, is to go to the gas station and pick up a cheap pack of razors. I can't just leave it like this. But this means that I definitely have to go into public and be seen like this.  So as I'm walking to the gas station, I'm hoping to all that is holy that the sweet, old Jewish lady who usually works nights isn't there. Oh, fucking please don't let it be her. She's so sweet, and old enough that she probably knows people who were in the Holocaust.   I get there, and luckily, it's not the old Jewish lady. Instead, it's a big black dude who always has a really loud, booming voice and is rather intimidating sometimes. I walk in, and he immediately sees me and my 'stache. I expect him to go into some rant about my racist ass walking into his store worshiping Hitler or something. Instead, he just busts up laughing immediately.  I pick up a four-pack of razors, and get a Nazi salute as I head out the door, and ran home to shave off the last little bit of hair from my lip.  It was a rough night. ||||| I'd mark that in the win category. The worst part to happen was him busting your balls. If it was the elderly Jewish woman, then I would say it was a fucked up day. I'd take the ball busting with pride over having a sweet lady despise you. ||||| you fucked up? you just made that guy's night ||||| Don't worry. Just think of it as a Charlie Chaplin mustache instead.  ||||| MJ rocked it... Too bad there is no chance in that stache  coming back for a few generations at least ||||| If your facial hair is long enough to do that you should probably get an electric razor and use that first. Your razors will last a lot longer, you nazi shit head.  ||||| A+ ||||| Bowler hat, cane, now you're Chaplin, problem solved ||||| Was that black guy a neo nazi? ||||| Post pics next time you do it. ||||| Good god that was tense.

2682	1,3,2,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	41	There has been a lot of debate why /r/Atheism seems to just attack Christians and rightfully so.  It is actually easily explained and has two root causes.   The first of all is a lot of the people who post on /r/Atheism are ex Christians who were forced into Christianity.  They feel like they were taken advantage of when they were children and posting anti-Christian post on /r/atheism without social and financial consequence is how they fight back.   The next one is the Christian attempt to interfere in peoples lives.  From Gay Marriage, Abortion, non-secularism to Evolution, Christians attempt to interfere in science and peoples bed rooms.  You combine this was hypocrisy and you are going to piss off a lot of people.  If other religions gain the power to affect the political and social fabric in the United States Christians have you will start to see a lot of attacks on that religion, people hate being told what to do.  Except for you UK, there should be way more anti-Islam I expect more anti-Islam stuff from you guys.  Someone knocks a beer out of my hand on purpose I am knocking their teeth down their throat.  Where did all the soccer hooligans go?  So keep the anti-religion going, a lot of the Christians hate us because we are effective and see us as a threat.  We are telling the King he has no cloths on and the people are listening.  It is the free flow of information that will kill religion  edit-1 I also like to mention certain Christian Sects are not attacked on /r/Atheism while others are mentioned very often.  A lot of it has to do with their interference in other peoples lives.  If Christians would leave people alone they wouldn't be attacked as much.  You reap what you sow  ||||| I am an ex-hindu and I am deeply offended by /r/atheism. Why? Because I feel left out, because I feel the biggest group of passive-aggressive and bigoted people is going scott-free, just because a community that should unanimously condemn all religions equally ignores them. Unless more Hindus read stuff directed at their religion the ex-hindu atheists like me will continue to be a meager minority, abused bullied at home, workplace and anywhere else where people around know our religious views. ||||| Sorry about that man. Where are you living? I'm guessing the UK from your username just because it includes the word "bugger". I think the lack or criticism probably has to do with Americans general lack of contact with members of the Hindu faith as well as their general lack of knowledge about it. ||||| I actually unsubbed from advice animals because of how much bitching they were doing about r/atheism. If it was funny that would be fine but it's not funny it's just lame whining and whinging. At least make a joke about how Dawkins looks like he might be Emma Watson's dad. ||||| I say bring it on. We can take it. The people who say this don't understand the effect this sub has. They see what hits the front page and wonder why it has gained so much support to hit the front page and like the rest of us wonder how a stupid unfunny meme has even hit the front page. However, these memes may be funny to another age group, or to new users.   They do not see the whole sub. ||||| I know of a lot of atheists on reddit that hate this sub too.  I see people talk about how, regardless of their theological beliefs, even if they are similar to ours, unsub almost instantly. ||||| Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!  Well said!!!  There are a lot of EX-RELIGIOUS people out here!  The brainwashing of children has to stop!!!  The next generation is smarter than we are.

I fear that with christianity being uprooted islam will come in and swoop the shattered remains. Islam definitely needs more light shone on it so the public won't be deceived so easily.  ||||| You forgot the argument that most English speakers know more about Christianity then other religions or are simply not affected by them, so they mostly post stuffs about Christianity ||||| I think a lot of people that fall  into the category of atheist hate r/atheism because they just want to live and let live ...they don't believe but at the same time they don't really see the harm in believing in fairy tales   They hate people who do speak up because it makes them uncomfortable to rock the boat ...and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with a need not to be like Christians who go door to door   Personally I didn't grow up with religion and I'm still an anti-theist because I see religion and superstition as a social I'll but I guess I can understand their point of view to a certain extent  ||||| /r/atheism is not made up of only 14 year olds who have a temporary rebellion against god because they didn't get an XBox for Christmas. It's not a bunch of neckbeards who dwell here every single day for the purpose of mocking religious people.  Insulting, making fun of, or merely questioning one's religion is a very drastic step to take. "There are two things friends don't talk about: politics and religion"... this is a usual social rule that works most of the time. But this here is a public discussion board about atheism specifically, so it doesn't apply here, but don't expect the effects of putting one's religion on the spot to be any less severe. **People will get mad.** Redditors will get mad. They don't like their dogma to be poked and will preserve it like it's the untarnished picture of their loving mothers, some going as far out as to twist the violent words of the bible and many religious power figures, just so that they can still believe their faith is just. tl;dr: You will be called a neckbeard or a 14year old idiot. This is normal and expected.  This subreddit is a valuable resource for many who are having doubts, or are having trouble sorting out their feelings regarding their own religion. This is hard, you all know it is. That's why we need quality content to make people think, to let them know that we think as well. We are not teenagers who hate god just because, but instead most of us have come to a logical conclusion that god, the omnipotent presence that was described by many, doesn't exist in the way most think it does. I don't like it when people belittle our hard path of losing faith. It's not a chocolate vs vanilla choice, it's a drastic step in life. Most of us are "agnostic atheists", and we're proud that we don't know what's the exact origin of the universe, or what's the exact purpose of life. We won't make stuff up about it to make us feel good. As a consequence from our deconversions, I like to think we've developed more skeptical thinking than the general public. Not as many atheists purchase snake-oil treatments, believe in spiritual phenomena, find ET in our backyards, etc.  This is why this subreddit is necessary. Not only to promote positive atheism, but skeptical inquiry and good will.  Just go easy on the memes, the Facebook dialogs or huge quotes. We need more news, calls for action, inspirational self posts, mind tickling questions, comedic material stemming from original content, debates, etc. This won't stop the ridicule from others, but it will make this subreddit better. I think it deserves to be better.  As always, [**READ THE FAQ**]([URL] ||||| Let's try to do this *logically*. And no, the "quotes" in these posts are not verbatim; I'm summarizing it.   >"Christians have attacked a lot of people; ergo, Christians deserve to be attacked by us"  The problem with this is:  1. who are these Christians? 2. who have they attacked? 3. why have they attacked? 4. when r/atheism "attacks" said Christians, are they the same as (1)?  Because when you think about it, is it rational for an average Iraqi to throw his shoes at a passing, average American because "Americans attack Iraq"?   Moving on:  >"we must fight the creeping Christianization (or Islamization, if you're in the UK" of our country!  Except that mindlessly shitposting (yes, I said "shitposting". Because quality posts in r/atheism - ones that are actually thought-provoking - are very few in number) will not do anything. Who are you trying to kid? What sort of activism do you think posting Facebook screenshots to the (pun not intended) choir would do?  On the other hand, by needlessly antagonizing believers - those who do actually agree with you, or otherwise on the fence - you are hurting your cause (whatever it is) more than you're helping it. Because unless if you're actually advocating a violent overthrow of the government, you still need numbers to affect a change - and pissing off the theists who *can* be on your side is not going to win you friends (and votes).  Finally  >it's free speech!   I agree. That's why hating on hating is also considered free speech. I lost count on how many people here berated me for disagreeing with them. It's as if freedom of speech goes only one way.  However, I would also like to add that "you can say it" does not necessarily mean "you should say it". Maybe it's a cultural thing, but I believe in "playing nice" when possible. Worship what you want, as long as you don't bother me. But in return, I'll also hold my peace and won't comment and how silly your rituals are. Fair's fair and all that. ||||| So just to clarify - we have a problem with Christians (which we've lumped all into a single group responsible for the acts of individuals) hating us, and use that as our justification to hate them back?  Yes the free flow of information may reduce religion's impact, but the free flow of vitriol accomplishes nothing whatsoever. ||||| They think they are being attacked even when they aren't. The persecution complex some of them have is astonishing.  ||||| I don't feel hate for Jews, Christians, or Muslims, I feel pity, sadness, and a sense of loss for mankind....because of their influence on events we are all just riding their delusional wave of bullshit. There's no place to run, no place to hide from their collective insanity. We have it rammed down our throats unless we simply tune the fuck out.  ||||| What's also interesting is how much more of a threat atheism is seen as compared with the threat of other religions. We don't represent another god that can be argued against with holy books, we are a group that first needs convincing of the existence of ANY god,let alone theirs. Here their books have no effect because divine revelation is assumed. This scares them, because they have to convince us of their core assumptions and they are unable to do it, and rather than face trying to convince themselves of these assumptions from a null point they prefer to deride and attack those of us who say 'Sorry not convinced. Now could you let me eat this bacon sandwich/have sex with whomever I want to and consents.' ||||| Nicely said. Ex christian here, I like /r/athiesm because I can heavily relate to the posts since I've seen both sides of the coin of religion. ||||| Does anger, no matter how justified, always relieve? ||||| I find that most of the insight in /r/atheism actually comes from the comments much more than the actual posts themselves. ||||| I have no problem with people wanting to be Christian- if they act like Christians. I am an agnostic who works at a retirement home for Christian missionaries. They are terrific people who genuinely tried to love everyone in the world, and none have tried to convert me or tell me that my relationship with my girlfriend (I'm a chick) was a sin. I make sure that those who are wheelchair-bound are able to hear the noon devotionals, and would never interfere with their worship. I do not believe in it, but they do, and I recognize that they find meaning in it. Which is why it's funny to me when Christians accuse me of trying to stuff my gay (well, bi) agenda down their throats. I am happy to live and let live- whatever bitterness I have against Christians stems from their prejudice, not my own.

1057	1,3,3,3	5	I'm sure we've all seen suggestions on Reddit about how to make Random Draft either more fun or less flavor-of-the-month.  The most-often suggested change I've seen is to reduce the hero pool from 50 to between 30 and 40 heroes. As it stands right now, Random Draft essentially cuts out slightly more than half of the hero pool. The suggested changes would cut the hero pool around 28%-37%.  There is, however, a problem with the Random Draft as a gamemode in general. There is a reason why the title of this post contains the keyword **consistently**.  The problem with RD is that because of less heroes in the pool there is a small chance that some heroes will be completely uncounterable (in terms of hero picks). This chance goes up higher with more heroes removed. This leads to massively skewed games in favor of whoever is able to get that one "broken/fotm hero who is already difficult to counter."  ****  Of course this problem is usually only more prevalent and noticeable in higher ranked matchmaking, but the point still stands:  **Random Draft will lead to some heroes being completely uncounterable in certain situations** (in this case OD stands out, though there are definitely more). With the thousands upon thousands of games of Dota being played per day I'm sure that a situation such as this has occurred already, and it won't stop because of the inherent nature of Random Draft.  There are a few questions that I still have, but don't know the answer to:  1. Is this able to be fixed? If so, how? 2. Should RD even have a ranked queue option?  3. Am I just an idiot overthinking things?  *TL/DR: I think Random Draft has some major flaws that need to be addressed. Some heroes cannot be countered in certain situations.* ||||| same as last pick in ap in some situations ||||| [deleted] ||||| > Some heroes cannot be countered in certain situations.  That's the fun part of this game mode - You actually have to "draft" in limited hero pool. If you see some niche hero, that cannot be countered? Pick it first! or communicate with your team mates about how you deal with that etc. 
7855	1,3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,2	35	So I keep seeing people mention various ways they've interacted with Lisa. My first playthrough during one of the loops (don't remember which but it was before the red lights appeared and after I had the flashlight I believe) -- I went to the front door to check it, turned around and BOOM! Ghost lady is there, makes me jump and scream. My neck breaks and then I wake up in that room again only to find it didn't reset but is continuing on.  I thought that was a scripted moment during the game but on my next playthrough, it didn't happen there. Instead it was in the middle of the hall (I think) but same result more or less. That second time is when I discovered the bag in the room and thought to observe it.  I just replayed it tonight to show a friend and...nothing. I was waiting and even turned around when the radio said, would check the doors and then turn around, thinking Lisa would appear but nothing. There was never anything... which was almost spookier.  But now I'm seeing all sorts of things --that you can encounter Lisa in the final puzzle. None of the times I've done it has it worked. The only time I've seen her is in the mirror but supposedly you can turn around at various moments such as when you hear her breathing and she'll get you? Hasn't happened to me. I even intentionally turned around and nada.  I've also read about actually seeing her from a distance and then having her like charge at you? Again -- not once has this ever happened in my playthroughs. I've only ever seen her when she closes the bathroom door early on, when she's broken my neck to the two times it's happened, and in the mirror during the final puzzle. Definitely haven;t seen her from a distance.  There have been other odd things. During one of the "red light" loops prior to the "endless hall" with the peephole (I think when doing the from H E L L/HELLO! thing by running back and forth between the phone and exit door, I noticed a figure standing down the initial/clock hallway. At the end. Just standing there. It didn't quite look like Lisa but I assumed it was and that she'd charge at me... Nope. The figure disappeared. It actually reminds me of the figure you see early on after turning right -- you see a mysterious figure standing in the hall and as you approach the lights go off and it disappears. But maybe that figure IS Lisa both times and I'm just a dummy.  But yeah... just wondering. Also apparently you can see her out the window once? My first time I tended to check everything a lot but never noticed it. My most recent playthrough I managed to finally see the figure looming in the balcony. Is that the son? It looks like a man and not Lisa though it's very obviously similar in appearance.  Anyway... just how much is there to this dang teaser?? ||||| I actually cannot beat the last loop because I can't go anywhere during the hauntings. Without fail for each one she either appears down the first hall next to the clock or just past the clock near the first door, in the second hall just before the foyer, or in the same hall just beyond the doorway past the radio. If I move she either possesses me or kills me and if I don't she dissapears when the haunting is over. She is also appearing in the mirror and window next to the phone and I haven't heard of anyone having her appear so consistently every time.   Like I played for an hour on a single loop and was seeing her every time I turned around, being very careful not to be attacked. And I never got past the damn baby laughing for the first time.  I am so frustrated. ||||| Do you have all the picture parts? ||||| Try looking in the bathtub or toilet. Something between the two triggered the second laugh for us, after everything else gave no results. ||||| What happens when she possess you? Is it just you hear her sobbing really close, or does she actually take over the controls or something? The latter would be scary as fuck ||||| Gotta have that mic plugged in. Makes a world of a difference. Make sure you talk to the fetus, it can change the entire course of the difficulty.   EDIT: Just noticed thehypotheticalnerd's sound advice there. That'll get ya taken care of. Good luck!!   ||||| A lot of shit is randomized, people found the pattern to the last puzzle by now but at first, nobody had any clue and some despaired because it seemed like the RNG had given them very very low chances of the phone ringing. With lisa it's the same (and yes, she is the only ghost you see), you also seem to have missed in all your playthroughs that she also appears outside the house, twitching in front of the window closest to the phone. I think everybody does die pretty consistently when the voice says "Don't touch that dial" but with the "Look behind you" some people die and some don't.  ||||| I've made 2 of my friends play it and she didn't attack either of them. Kinda disappointing. I do know that after the game "crashes," she'll spawn in 2 or 3 spots in the hallway and rush you if you approach. If you have surround sound, you can simply follow her cries to her location.  ||||| My boyfriend and I played it for 4-5 hours the first night and got stumped on the final puzzle, never saw Lisa except for getting tackled during the "Look behind you." part.   I picked up the game again the next day while I was alone and figured I'd work on the final puzzle some more. Not only did she tackle me again, but twice I caught her standing all twitchy at the top of the stairs before she ran at me. I was too scared to keep playing.   Boyfriend tried the next night. Didn't see her in the halls at all. ||||| What triggers a Lisa attack?  I've only ever seen her that one scripted time in the hallway when she first appears and then disappears.  Every other time, she just seems to randomly decide to appear in the screen and eat my face.

4390	1,3,3,3,3	5	So I saw this [article]([URL] yesterday on reddit and wondered why is it such a big deal that we make people "pay for what they use" when dealing with transportation? We don't do that with Education, or Social Security, or Healthcare. Why don't we just have a general "Transportation tax" added to our taxes to pay for roads? ||||| One argument is that education, social security, and healthcare benefit everyone and everyone will use a similar amount on average.    Even if you don't have kids, you probably got some public education or at minimum you get to enjoy living in a society surrounded by people with some education, which is nice for you.  Same with healthcare and SS, you get to live in a country where people are kind of looked after and they're not dying in the streets or spreading disease everywhere (a bit of hyperbole but you get the idea).  Gas taxes are largely used for road repair, and then it makes more sense to say "If you use the road more than everyone else, as measured by the fuel you use, then you derive more benefit than them and should pay a larger share."  It also encourages beneficial behavior.    People are encouraged to save money by riding their bike, driving a fuel-efficient car, carpooling, taking public transportation... each of these reduce pollution or traffic or road damage, etc.  If there's a flat transportation fee then there's less incentive to be fuel efficient. ||||| Part of the reason is that a gas tax is easy to implement and is a reasonable effective way to measure use.  A pencil tax, aspirin tax, or Denny's Early Bird Special tax would not map particularly well with education, health care, or social security. ||||| What would a general transportation tax be?  GPS everyone and monitor them 24/7 to monitor how far they move?  One theory is that you make people "pay for what they use" because otherwise they are likely to use the "wrong" amounts of it.    Another theory is that you do it this way because it is easier to get political coalitions together to pass that type of law.  Avid bicyclists are less likely to oppose building roads if they aren't paying for them.  And, yes, we do do that with other things.  Once education is no longer compulsory, you do have to pay for it, more or less.  Social security benefits are roughly proportional to the social security taxes paid in (there are two "bend points" which make the program overall progressive, but still the benefits are not independent of the taxes paid).  And you may have noticed that Obamacare has been ever so slightly controversial. ||||| Because only Gas is evil.  It's hard to charge a tax on horses.  
1747	1,2,3,3,3	23	I try not to fixate on Memantine too much, but every so often (i.e. during periods of crisis) I longingly think of it as the one that got away. There are a handful of accounts on the 'net of people with chronic dysthymia, anhedonia etc. who turned around their lives with the Memantine + stim combo, but the most pertinent to me is a guy on dr-bob who had crippling OCD, was basically vegetative for years, and miraculously experienced remission on Memantine and was able to re-enroll in college.   I tried the brand-name version (Ebixa) about 7 years ago, but found it overstimulating. I read the overstimulation can pass with time, so later revisited it with a psychiatrist 2 years ago and held on as long as I could, at varying doses, but was still severely anxious for 8 weeks.   Then I read about a guy on longecity who claimed he had previously experienced increased anxiety on Memantine, but responded to it normally after a course of NSI-189. Not willing to discount anything that might help at this point, I ordered a batch of NSI-189, took for it a month, then crossed my fingers and tried Memantine, but only experienced the overstimulation once again.  Strangely, the NSI-189 did reverse a bunch of other paradoxical reactions I had been experiencing -- to GABAergics like l-theanine, Neurontin, Z-drugs etc. I had also had trouble with Uridine, but found it calming when taken with NSI-189. Since Uridine is an NMDA antagonist, maybe there is another receptor affinity of Memantine which gives me grief. Likewise, Magnesium L-threonate (I don't know the extent to which it acts via NMDA compared to other forms of magnesium?) induces the same hypervigilance I experience on Memantine, but then settles into an anxiolytic effect after a week or so.  I guess I feel tired of half-measures. Most psych drugs are intolerable and not worth the side-effects. My doctor is angling to put me on Parnate again, but it only offers me like 50% relief from my symptoms and the insomnia is a nightmare. Otherwise, I flit from noot trial to noot trial as I can afford it, which allows for some  scattered productivity, but I never feel like I have my head above water.   Has anyone here who responded poorly to Memantine ever found a way around it? ||||| How low dose dose did you try? With what frequency?  I understand that it has a very long half life. Maybe starting with a milligram every third day?  And slowly increasing over a month's time to 5 mg every other day?  As alternatives for stress relief, have you  tried kanna, calm-aid (lavender oil preparation), or kava? ||||| Hi there. I had the same problem with memantine. Only got up to 10mg a day. It was energizing at first, but eventually resulted in debilitating anxiety. I had to discontinue, I felt so awful I was crying all the time.  Interestingly, I tried lamictal recently, which has a similar mechanism of action (calcium channel blocker) and experienced something similar. People say that lamictal is stimulating in high doses, and more sedating in high doses. They say it has to do with lamictal reducing the action of glutamate neurons in low doses. These neurons have an inhibitory effect on dopamine neurons, so when you inhibit the inhibitor, your dopamine neurons go wild.  All of this is to say, the effect you experienced with memantine could potentially go away at higher doses. 20mg or even 40mg a day. At that point it might begin to have a dampening effect on your dopamine neurons as well. Would be difficult to get through the uncomfortable anxious phase, but there's a pretty good chance that the effect is dose-dependent. ||||| I wanted to like it too but my body rejected it. We are all different and that's OK. You'll find something out there that will help you. Have you tried Rhodiola? ||||| So you find the stimulating effect of memantine to be debilitating enough to warrant not using it? You're right in that the stimulating effect does wane in time (for me personally it ceased at about a month and a half in) but it was to my dismay as I really rather enjoyed it because it felt like an amphetamine to me, albeit to a slightly lesser degree. I would recommend trying it again but pairing it with tianeptine which should somewhat counteract the stimulating, anxiogenic effects, especially since memantine is known to lessen the tolerance and may even potentiate the mu-opoid agonistic effect. 
1664	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	11	Did you get a setlist? Meet your idol and get your ticket signed? My favorite piece is a drum stick I caught when I saw Chrome Sparks at The Husdson Project this year. It was one of the only acts that went on that day, the rest of the festival was cancelled due to a massive storm that rolled through. It was a fairly early set and pretty empty, so after the show Jeremy came out and met and chatted to the few of that hung around. He signed the stick for me :)   [URL] ||||| Got a signed set list from Tom Odell and his Band at the Brooklyn Bowl where he played a few sets for the first time that are on his new album.   Drummer from Larry and his Flask at Warp Tour said to throw your shirts on stage.  I threw my Johnny Cash middle finger shirt on stage, which he kept, so I got a shirt signed by the band afterwards and his broken drumstick from wailing during the show.    Saw Patent Pending, an LI punk rock show in high school.  Bought an orange Tee from them.  Was pretty happy about it until I wore it to school the next day and a chick in my class wore the same shirt, so I got some fun from the guys.     ||||| When we were younger, one of my friends caught a half-empty Gatorade bottle that Ben Gibbard threw into the crowd after a Death Cab show. Later, on the train ride home, we passed it around and drank from it like it was communion wine. It's a little gross now, looking back on it. Probably a lot of backwash in there.  ||||| I went to see Patti Smith a couple of years ago. The venue had this railing separating the 21+ area and the under 21 area, and I got there early enough to stand right on it. At one point in the set, she left the stage to let her guitar player sing the song, and walked down that aisle. I reached out my hand to shake her hand, and we kinda bumped hands awkwardly, and she walked off. I thought, "Well, that was that."  She came back a second later and grabbed me and gave me a big hug, and just kinda hung out for a bit. Then she left, and came back and gave me a button.   I wore that button for a long time as a kind of badge of honor...And then one day it blew off my coat in a bad windstorm. But, I'll always have that memory. ||||| Matt Helders' (arctic monkeys) drum stick.  ||||| Rhcp set list at the free Vegas show in 2005...and John Frusciante's guitar pic at a concert in 2006. Favorite band...amazing moments I will cherish forever. ||||| 1998 Motley Crue Greatest Hits Tour.  At the stage and Nikki Sixx handed me his pick. ||||| In no particular order:  1. A laminate for the latest Lacuna Coil tour. I was there for 2 dates in NY. 2. A necklace given to me by BB King during a show in 1998. 3. A backstage pass to a Beastie Boys concert, also in 1998. 4. A selfie with Richard Patrick from Filter last year. I was just hanging out and he snuck up behind me, took my phone and snapped a pic of us. 5. A drumstick from the late Stuart Cable of Stereophonics, circa 2001. ||||| Autographed copy of "Definitely Maybe" that I caught after Noel Gallagher threw it into the crowd at a 2002 Oasis concert. ||||| I've had some awesome stuff happen.  1. I went to the Flight To Mars show in Seattle. It's Mike McCready's (Pearl Jam) tribute band to UFO. I'm friends with one of Mike's really close friends. He was also playing the show that night. He told Mike I wanted to meet him and brought him out to meet me. Mike is my hero and it was amazing. He gave me a poster signed by everyone who played the show that night. He was so sweet.  2. Literally running into Jerry Cantrell before an Alice in Chains' show.  3. Having all the guitar picks and drumsticks I've gotten from shows. I have about 30 picks and 2 drumsticks.  4. Having Mike McCready remember me at a Pearl Jam show later this year. I was front row and he came down off the stage, gave me some picks, and hugged me!   5. Being sneaked backstage to a RHCP concert in 2003. I was 11. My Uncle worked as a stage hand for the show and he sneaked me back. RHCP was cool with it. They were pretty nice guys.  So grateful for all of this stuff to happen.   *edited for spelling
4123	1,3,3,3,3,3	17	So I was thinking that there's really no way to do something like this currently. /r/JuiceSwap is for Europeans to get American juices and vice versa, and ecig classifieds is mostly hardware, and you have to purchase stuff with money rather than just swapping.  This thread could become a weekly/biweekly thing, where people post the juices they no longer want due to undesired flavour or nicotine content, and hopefully get something they do want in return!

No money should have to cross hands :)   What do people think? ||||| Well, this is a little awkward.  ||||| Hehehe timing!  ||||| We are in fact working on an /r/ecr_eu juiceswap soon!  If people have ideas on how to manage it, we'd love to hear about it! ||||| Glad to see some interest in this, it shows we are trying to do the right things. ||||| I like this idea, I have a few bottles i would gladly swap out =]
1094	1,3,2,3,3	7	I'm considering changing all of my listings to free shipping and having it be the same price as before. I would like to do it to make my excel sheet easier to compute the FVF's, and it is a tiny bit cheaper since there is no 20% off on the FVF's for the shipping costs. It's minimal, but I figure this may help counter the increased postal rates we have all noticed. ||||| Figure the cost into the final price. Free shipping just makes it easier on your buyer. I usually offer it for all my buy-it-nows. For auctions I will offer minimal shipping costs and then offer combined shipping discounts to entice folks to buy more than one item. ||||| > there is no 20% off on the FVF's for the shipping costs.  Just looking for confirmation that this is true. I recently made Top Rated and got the 20% FVF discount. Does this discount only apply to an item's price and not to the shipping? If so, that helps make a case for using free shipping more often. ||||| Simple answer from my experience: buyers prefer free shipping and it leads to more sales.  ||||| The only issue is that if an item comes back, you get to eat the cost of the shipping (because shipping was free).  That's what has kept me from going to 100% free shipping myself.

When i understand right some bitcoin books have started to refuse US clients,so why do they call it anonymous if location of the person is known? ||||| Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like the majority of your posts are about driving traffic... ||||| Price instability makes Bitcoin a terrible option for gamblers. The volatility of the exchange rate makes things far too unpredictable. Even if you win, a price swing could wipe you out. ||||| Is one problem with this not that (for UK facing operators anyway) there are certain money laundering regulations that must be adhered to in order to maintain their license?

5847	1,3	4	Hi, which record programm do you use? Because i uses BaronReplay but since the new patch i get an error every time that it cant get the game ID and now im searching for alternatives.  Hope you can help me :) ||||| You can ask for a replay at op.gg. Open your profile and when you are loading and about to get into the rift click on the "current match" on the op gg page and look for a "record" button, after the game has ended you can download an archive that can be opened with your client later. That's the only one i know and trust, hope it helped a little :/
9377	1,3	8	Hi, I recently decided to reinstall wow after a long hiatus due to being upgraded to War lords of Draenor for free. After going on Battle net to install the client i noticed that in the area that shows my account, it states: YOUR GAME ACCOUNTS WORLD OF WARCRAFT® World of Warcraft® : Warlords of Draenor™ [*******] Standard Edition Time Expired Europe (EU)  World of Warcraft® [WoW1] Starter Edition Active Korea (KR)   The second account shows Korea and i did not create it, after googling it seems that perhaps i got hacked. so what should i do now? i've changed my password but is there anything else i need to do. will I be banned once i try and go on, will all my items and gold be gone? i'm currently installing so i haven't found these things out yet. thanks for the help and time. ||||| You wont be banned no, and if you've changed your password then no there isn't much more to really do, maybe change your e-mail as well.  If you find out your things are gone when you log on, make a ticket.
1564	1,3,3,3,3,3	8	im just going to post what he said "I need to know what cards i could use multiples of and which cards not. Want it to be more consistent. i also need to know what shocks lands i could use more of. i like angels but if it works better without them thats okay." [URL] ||||| Start by going and reading "the rule of 9" linked on the sidebar.   Focus your deck in a bit, seems a bit eclectic in what its trying to do with a terrible mana curve.   The current standard has almost no way to punish spread mana bases with few basics, jam as many shocks as you want and can afford, they're pretty good. ||||| To your friend: It all depends on the goal of the deck, but you can always ask yourself this question(and answer it in 1 sentence): What is my deck supposed to do? Ex:  I have a Selesnya deck with Grove of the Guardian. What is it supposed to do? To populate tokens and swing. I don't mean to be harsh, but you're deck's mana spread screams subjective game play(you put cards you like in the deck despite their dissonance with each other).  You may say, "But Sandwich, isn't that the goal? To play with cards you like?". I'd say "Yes, but you play cards you like that **ALSO**  work together to help you win. I can see 9 different possible decks deriving from your deck. you usually want to cut x1's from decks, concentrate it into a main strategy( My initial question) and win. Once you get that down, deck building is fun! ||||| Hey this is the friend he was posting for. I know I have way too many one of's in my deck and and I was just wanting advice for what creatures I could use more of and what I could take out to have more copies. And to answer the question about what I want this deck to do is that I want to build a strong opening defence/offence until I can use deadeye and closet to make me unstoppable. I put together a deck that I felt was similar to this and more aggressive and I believe it will accomplish what I want it to ith fewer colors and be less fragile. Here's the list.  Creatures 4x arbor elf 4x burning tree emissary 4x primordial hydra 4x strangleroot geist 4x boros reckoner 4x hound of griselbrand 4x stuffy doll  Spells 4x boros charm 4x dormi rade 4x increasing savagery  Lands 3x cliff top retreat 3x root bound crag 3x sacred foundry 4x stomping ground 3x Sunpetal grove 4x temple garden  Sideboard 1x Gavin's township 2x Kessig wolf run 4x rancor 4x thunder maw hellkite 4x Gisela, blade of goldnight  I'm in some dispute as to wow I can main board rancor for some more damage output early and late game. I think this let's me do what I wanted the original deck to do but better and quicker. Do you think this is the way to make the deck more competitive at FNM? I just want to be able to improve it and be able to win with it, I'm open to more suggestions. ||||| The reason I have stuffy doll in there Is so that I'd be able to combo hydra with him when he's big in a pit fight using domri rade and just use that me Janice as a burn spell. I see what you mean by the angel being to slow and having potential mana problems in the early game. What's your suggestion to help make this faster. ||||| Shout out from the Gruul clans over here.

2154	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3	11	Got the lab position at Alesmith. Now it's time to get some steel toed boots and carhartts. I've seem people in overalls, jumpsuits, and just work pants. I've seen all sorts of boot brands at breweries and just want to know pros and cons of each. Cheers! ||||| We've done best with [Duluth]([URL]  Their firehose pants, especially the flex, are easy to move in, don't get wet easily, and aren't too hot to wear.  Their boarskin mocs/boots are the same.  We tried Dickies and Carhartt, but those brands are more for dirty environments like a car shop, not wet environments like a brewery.  Once they got wet you were like that for the rest of the day.  A lot of it was also heavy and movement restricting. ||||| Shouldn't your employer provide you with work clothes, shoes and personal protection? ||||| Keens boots, specifically the Milwaukee style. Everyone on the production side of the brewery I'm at has switched to them. Comfortable, not too heavy, well made, and the rubber covering the toe is great if you are doing work with nasty chemicals (caustic mostly for me in the cellar) ||||| If your willing to shell out the money, Red Back boots are great steel toe water resistant/chemical resistant boots sold at Ace uniforms on 16th street. If looking for the cheap, Onguard 6in lace up rubber boots are a popular choice in San Diego from Grainger. Unless you are working in a cold room for most of your shift skip the carhartts and go with dickies shorts, come August you'll understand. I'm down at Sdbc, drop by and we can share a pint. Cheers! ||||| These other comments are great for pants/boots. A lot of people don't spring for their own safety glasses, but I highly suggest you do. There's a lot of options out there and I personally have a fairly expensive pair, but $15 online can go a long way in terms of comfort.  ||||| Pants I recommend the Cabela's Rough Neck Canvas Jeans (Cabela's version of Carhartt) they're reasonably priced and tough as it gets while remaining completely comfortable . ||||| Do you know what your work environment is going to be yet? Is there a dedicated lab room, or an area on the production floor with your setup? Will you be on the floor collecting your own samples or will the production crew be collecting them?  If you're on the production floor most of the time, good comfortable rubber boots and sturdy work pants are a good idea. If most or all of your time is in a room off the the production floor, you might just need any steel toes and a lab coat.  I'd look up workwear shops in your area, get something basic, then ask the people you work with what's been comfortable and durable for them. ||||| Typically shorts and a comfortable shirt and my sneakers. Good freedom of movement and I like to be comfortable while I brew

4998	1,3,3,3	5	I'm currently with ATT and, from the looks of it, would really benefit from switching to T-Mobile. We have 3 phones and are paying ~$190 a month for all around unlimited texting and 3gb for two of the phones. From what I see with T-Mobile, we could get unlimited texting and data for all three AND save money.  This seems too good to be true. What are the pitfalls of switching to them? Can we keep our smartphones? Is there a reason NOT to switch? ||||| T-Mobile usually has pretty iffy service depending on your area. So check coverage maps of the place you live and places you frequent. Alternatively if you would like to keep your AT&T service see if Straight Talk is an option. You get the same service unlimited text calling and mobile data.( They do have a 2.5 GB cap where they start throttling so take that that into account.) Plus Straight Talk is only $45 a month. ||||| The plans really are that cheap, I just last week finished switching my parents over from sprint and their bill dropped quite a bit.   What you need to know about t-mobile is they no longer subsidize phone costs. If you want a phone, you must qualify for credit and they will finance it for a monthly fee (cost of phone divided into 24 monthly payments), or you must pay for it completely up front. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but keep it in mind as you wont be getting any 'free upgrades' or '$99 upgrades' to renew your account.   Their pay termination fees promotion essentially works like this: 1. You port your numbers to new Tmobile service. 2. You buy a new phone for each of these lines from Tmobile, up front or financed depends on your creditworthiness. 3. You trade in your old phones for each of these lines. 4. You submit your final bill showing that you payed ETFs to your previous carrier and they will issue a credit to your account.  Its a good program, but only if you are interested in buying your phones through Tmobile. Most of the higher end smart phones range from about $22-28/month, per device. So while your service bill will drop from ~190 to somewhere around ~110, you will probably pay about the same in the end if you want those high end phones. Additionally, if you wanted to shop around for unlocked devices from other sources, you are no longer eligible for the ETF reimbursement. Kind of a double edged sword if you intend to have the newest, highest end devices.  This brings me to the second thing I have learned. Be very careful with your phone selection. I had to return a couple google edition Moto G's that I had ordered from my parents, because despite listed as 'T-Mobile compatible', they lack the AWS 1700MHz band that T-Mobile uses for their HSPA+ network in most areas. As it turns out, the G-Play version is based on the global GSM model and lacks that frequency. Subsequently they were limited to GPRS 2G data, which is obviously not going to cut it for smart phones ;) ||||| When you sign up for the "Unlimited Talk/Text/Data," your data is actually capped at 500mb. They will charge you an extra $10/mo. for a 2GB cap. Other than that, their terms are pretty straight-up.
1280	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	15	maybe you ladies can help? ive been dying to play a really good scary game lately but i dont know what to play. preferably one with a story line and/or sequels. thank you! ||||| Fear ( all three are good and scary), Dead Space (Same, all three are scary ish but the first might not be available for the ps3, cant remember), Bioshock 1 & 2 aren't necessarily scary but they do have great jump scares.   I haven't played the Resident Evil games but they should be good. As well. Hope that's helpful!  ||||| Siren Blood Curse.  PS3 exclusive remake of Siren.  Adds or alters alot of the original as far as characters are concerned.  Gameplay is primarily running and hiding from roaming enemies, and light puzzle solving combat on occassion.  Trippy as fuck.  There's a feature called "Sightjacking" which lets you see through the enemy's eyes, and if you're being chased teh game might auto-sightjack.  Dead Space 1-3.  Really solid story throughout, never shits itself like most trilogies.  Fear 1.   Fear 2 is meh, and FEAR 3 is sloppy and halfhearted.  Bioshock 1-2. ||||| Surprised Fatal Frame hasn't been suggested yet. Fatal Frames 1-3 are all available on the US PSN as a PS2 Classic.  The way the game is played is you control a character that uses a camera to fight ghosts. You aim with the viewfinder on the camera and keep it centered on the ghost to charge, then take a picture. There are certain points in the ghosts attacks where you can do massive damage or chain snapshots together, usually the viewfinder will flash red or some kind of indicator.  The atmosphere of the game is really scary. Just the anticipation of when the ghosts will attack. They can appear at random as you're moving through the rooms.  The first two games aren't really connected storywise, but they both lead up to the third game. The third Fatal Frame basically ties the previous two games together and you start to see the connections.  ||||| First Dead Space is the scariest. It's best played with headphones so you get the full effect of whispering voices.  ||||| Have you played the Silent Hill games? I love them!! I think the story is totally creepy.     ||||| Have you played the Silent Hill games? My sister is a horror junkie and she loves the Silent Hill games. I myself am a complete wuss but they are quite compelling in terms of story.  I just finished The Last of Us and that is a really fun scary game, too! I highly recommend it.  This isn't for PS3 but if you have a Gamecube knocking around, have you played Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem? It's fucking terrifying and part of the game is something called the  Sanity Meter. The more your meter goes down, the weirder things get. It starts with things like looking like there's a fly on your screen. It also pretends to turn off the game and other creepy stuff like that. My sister loved it. ||||| It's not a horror game but more of tense survival situation, but if you haven't played The Last of Us yet you really really should.

2628	1,3,2	10	Ok, I recently deleted my old name and attempted to be male again in a desperate attempt to save my marriage. <erroneous info>Obviously this has failed. I broke down and told her Im sorry I cant be the husband you want. She replied that she saw this coming and that she doesn't want to be with someone who cant keep a promise. This of course infuriates me due to the whole sickness and health vow we took but thats another post all together</erroneous info>  During the initial falling out my mother took it upon herself to tell my uncle about what was going on because "He'll love you no matter what". Well the next day he asks for me to meet him at my grandmothers house. No one was there but him in his police uniform. He talked to me about how I needed to "man up" and that I would have to answer for what I've done some day. Through this he has clenched teeth, forward body posture, and clenched fists. This is one of my tormentors when I was young. I honestly fear for my life, but I dont want to be away from my children. Thoughts, ideas suggestions?  Amy ||||| Well, Amy, there are two options:  1. "Man up" and be miserable forever because shitty people are shitty. This also means you are a bad example for your children because you're telling them that their feelings aren't important if it goes against the grain. Think about it: how would you tell one of your kids to act if they were in your shoes?  2. If you honestly fear for your life, you need to seek help. You need to do anything you think will make you safer, from moving to filing a restraining order against your uncle to telling his precinct about his behavior. Your uncle has freedom of speech, but if he's in his uniform he is talking to you as a police officer and a police officer has no right to talk to you in this manner. Freedom of speech also ends at threats, and if you feel that his statement of you having to answer for it some day is a threat that he will come after you, then you need to report this. I know you don't want to move to leave your kids, but it's better for them to have you *alive* and able to talk to them and love them than it is for them to have you physically present and miserable acting like a man.    The sad fact is that you will almost certainly lose people over this. However, those people are encouraging you to be miserable for the rest of your life because they personally don't want to accept you, so are those the people you really want to have as family? Contrary to popular belief, you CAN choose your family. You can't choose your bloodline but you can choose what people to associate with.   And let your wife know that not sticking with you through thick and thin is HER not keeping a promise and also means that she doesn't love you like you thought she did. I'm not attracted to women but if my husband came out as transgender to me and wanted a full operation I would stand by her because we're married, I love the person and we'll figure something out about the sex later. That's what love does. If your wife can't accept that, then why the hell should anyone (like you!) "man up" for her just to appease her? That's bullshit and you know it!   ||||| Do you, or have you, ever lived in Japan? The person that helped me conclude that I am trans lived in Japan, and she had a wife that didn't know. Her situation was just similar to yours, and she also called herself Amy.

3231	1,3	4	I'm currently planning to build a gaming rig, something I haven't tried in about 6 years, but I've come across an unexpected problem: colour choice.  I'm trying to get an overall blue theme, but having a tough choice (specs wise) between these boards: [ASRock Z97 Extreme4] ([URL] [MSI Z97S SLI Plus] ([URL]  Or if I should just go with a mostly black [Asus Z97-A] ([URL]  Or just go with any of the myriad red boards, like the [MSI Z97 G Gaming 5]([URL] because red's faster, right?  This is the build I'm currently planning [PC Partpicker list] ([URL] and I'm looking at spending no more than £120 (I know the 29" ultra widescreen doesn't make it seem like it, but there is some form of budgetting going on, honest)  Any help or suggestions will be greatly appreciated. ||||| Are you planning on doing SLI in the future then? If not, you can go with something like the ASRock Z97 Pro4 for cheaper. Otherwise, it is really a matter of price or preference. I prefer the ASRock myself, but it is a few pounds more. You should just see what your priorities are as far as that goes. Also, I would like to suggest that you take a look at your RAM, you could probably get some DDR3-1600 CAS 7 or 8 that would be faster than the memory you currently have chosen, and would probably cost the same or less.   Hope this helps!

3090	1,3,3,3,3	12	There are probably a lot of these posts, so please bear with me here.   My wife and I are moving to Boston and are considering the neighborhoods of Davis Square/Porter Square, South End, North End and Charlestown.  I'd love to know what people like and dislike about these areas. ||||| Consider Jamaica Plain, too.   You can find places with much more space (if you're interested in that) for the same price or cheaper than the neighborhoods you mentioned.  I rent an entire house with 3 other roommates and my rent is only $500/month.  Lots of musicians/artists/creative people.  Good restaurants, stores, yoga studios, etcs. up and down Centre/South St. from Jackson Sq to Forest Hills.  10-15 minutes to downtown on the orange line.  Easy parking if you'll have a car.  If you bike, the Southwest Corridor is one of the greatest bike paths the area offers - connects you right to the Back Bay.  Plenty of just general beauty in JP and nearby too:  Jamaica Pond, Arnold Arboretum, Franklin Park, Stony Brook Reservation (< 5 miles), Blue Hills (short drive).  All this and you're still in Boston proper. ||||| Davis/Porter: 28 and lived here for the past 4 years (just moved to Watertown).  Multi-use path, lots of walkable shit (bars, gyms, 24 hour grocery AND cvs pharmacy).  I don't have much 'bad' stuff to say about the area.  If either of you plan on working in downtown, the commute is really quick/carefree.  I miss living in Somerville-its a truly WONDERFUL city to live in....the city has a great website/resources and holds all sorts of great events (like a fluff festival, and HONK which is a Oktoberfest-like event).  While I lived on a fairly busy road, it was still a 'neighborhood'.  Students and families living together just fine.  North End: You will have mice/cockroaches.  All the buildings are pretty old.  A friend just moved there-while it will be a nice walk to work for her and she's right in the middle of the city...she's paying top dollar for a smaller apt that has roaches.  Just sayin'  Frankly, every once in a while i love to go on a saturday, enjoy a lunch and great coffee there then go to the farmer's market and its one hell of a fun day.  The greenway is also right there, which makes for a fun place to take a walk.  But living there?  Too much.  Narrowest roads you've ever seen-awful for parking.  Most residents have to get a monthly overnight pass at one of the garages in the financial district.  South End: I like this area-great restaurants.  Walking distance to back bay and theater districts (and therefore downtown as well).  But, parking is a bitch.  So, if you don't have a car?  You're good.  Other than that, I can't tell you too much.  It seems that half the residents of the south end also have a dog....bygones....  I have very little experience w/ Chalestown and therefore don't feel comfortable making any judgement on it. ||||| We looked in all the same places before settling on east Arlington. Why we chose it:  Bigger places, for the same cost, a place here is about twice as large as most of the places you listed.  Outdoor space,  not all places have it, but it's much more likely in Arlington and Somerville than Boston or Cambridge.  Proximity to Davis, I can walk to Davis in about 10-15 minutes, but I'm also far enough away to escape the crowds. ||||| It's important to note that Davis is in the city of Somerville and Porter is in the city of Cambridge. Each of these cities offer different services from Boston. The public works, Human Services, politics etc each make for a different experience. Boston services are sparse compared to Camb and Som. Services are sparse. Taxes in Camb are incredibly low campared to the others. The parks in Camb. ( where I live) are fantastic. Somerville is a densely populated city. Camb is nearly as dense. Camb has a high density of liquor licenses (260 ish). Somerville has about 110. I think that  Cambridge has the best selection of restaurants. Camb is also influenced by the presence of Harvard and MIT. Somerville less so by Tufts.

2094	1,3,3,2,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	20	[deleted] ||||| These are the best explanations of the  time skipping power in my opinion:  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  ||||| For the next 10 seconds, King Crimson can see everything that will happen and can't be attacked. Everyone does what they would've done as if he never used KC. Once that is over, no one will remember any of it and it will be as if time skipped over 10 seconds for them. ||||| Have you seen Futurama? Do you know about the time skip episode? It's like that, except Diavolo can act within the skipped time, while others have no control during it:  [URL] ||||| Basically when he activates his power, he "skips" time. Specifically, everyone else acts as though they normally would (what had they planned on doing) when the time is skipped but King Crimson and Diavolo can move freely. No one remembers the skip either, for some reason.  So, let's say Mista wanted to shoot Diavolo and Narancia is standing behind Diavolo. King Crimson activates, Mista shoots as if he were shooting Diavolo, but would instead shoot Narancia. And also it would skip from before the shot, to Narancia with a sudden gunshot wound as far as everyone could see.  I believe King Crimson can also attack during this time. ||||| If there is a different reddit I should be using for part 5 discussion, please tell me and I'll take this post down from here! Thanks again. ||||| My go-to explanation is that King Crimson basically has the power of the next-scene button on a DVD remote. King Crimson can skip time x amount of seconds and no one else will know what happened during that time because no one saw the scene and because no one was conscious, no one can act either. KC can do both though because he has the remote so he's the guy filling in the blanks for everyone else "watching". ||||| it just works damit! ||||| Someone post that image of the Architect from The Matrix saying "we have done this many times before". ||||| Skips time. Epitaph shows him where everyone will be ten seconds into the future, and he can skip up to ten seconds to reach that point.  Everything that is fated to happen still happens, but Diavolo can escape the influence of fate during the timeskip and use the skipped time to position for an attack or get out of the way of danger. The tricky part of all of this is that whatever Diavolo is fated to do still happens (like ripping off Trish's arm in the elevator), but Diavolo is still free to position himself during the timeskip. This means that he can do bad things to you if fate demands it, but you can't do bad things to him even if fate demands it because he can move during skipped time.  If Diavolo and you are destined to punch each other in the face in 9 seconds, he can activate King Crimson and skip ahead ten seconds. You'll get punched in the head because fate demanded it, but because Diavolo skipped one second past getting hit in the face himself, your punch will phase through him because it never happened. Hell, he can activate King Crimson, run in the exact opposite direction for 10 seconds, and after the time skip you'll have been punched and he'll have taken off somewhere.    The only way to reliably hit Diavolo during skipped time is to attack him in such a manner that he can't get out of the way in 10 seconds, even when he sees it coming. Also note that Diavolo can only attack people during skipped time if fate dictates that he attacks them. If fate doesn't dictate that he gets an attack in he doesn't have any say in it. What he can do is skip time, then position himself during the skipped time, then attack the moment after the timeskip when everybody is confused. ||||| [empty] ||||| I bet it's King Crimson  *clicks*  Yep ||||| Basically, KC's power is all about cause and effect (which is also the key to understanding another potentially confusing stand that appears towards the end of the part). KC can see up to 10 seconds into the future and "erase" any amount of that time as he sees fit. Think of it like a roll of film, he sees himself getting attacked a few seconds into the future, so he snips out the frames where the attack hits him. Everyone else experiences this as time jumping from the point where KC activates his power to the point where time resumes, the time in between has been completely erased (contrary to a popular misconception that everyone experiences the erased time normally, but only KC remembers it).  Where this gets interesting (and confusing) is that any action that started before the time-skip will continue as if the erased time still took place e.g. if a projectile is headed towards KC and he activates his ability to erase the moment of the projectiles impact it will continue on its course as if KC wasn't there. This also works the other way around, preventing KC from initiating any attacks during the erased time, as the attack will never have occured once he uses his power. ||||| It like that old _Red Dwarf_ scene about the white hole [spoiler](#s "effect doesn't have to follow cause") ||||| it just works

5921	1,3,3,3,3	5	I mean top, jungle, mid, adc, supp. I don't think it will be hard to implement, and will make the game for spectators and players a bit clearer. ||||| I agree that it would be nice, but it wouldn't work. First of all, it simply could not work in the normal/old champion select, because people choose their roles after joining, unlike in the LCS where everyone knows where they're going.   They could TECHNICALLY implement it in the new champ select where they know where everyone is going-but then top would ALWAYS be first pick and NEVER get to ban, jungle would be second and no ban, etc. It's feasable, but not very healthy to make someone decide if they'd like to be able to ban a counter but have less of a chance of getting their champion. The current system works fine, though it sacrifices some visibility/clarity for gameplay.  ||||| Well no one trades champs in solo queue so you'd always be giving red side counter picks on blues top/mid champ. which seems a little unfair for solo queue. ||||| Cause you don't know where their wukong with ignite is going, if it was ordered that way automatically you would have access to information that you should not yet have and you could change stuff accordingly.  Also this has been asked a lot lately and there is a search function, I suggest you try that next time. ||||| I think they need to keep it random order during draft for the new que. But they need to have the scoreboard in game automatically adjusted for lcs style imo

I currently have one without, and gets so damn annoying after an hour of jumping around! I will be getting a new one with a chest strap before hitting up EDC for sure. ||||| Just picked up The North Face torrent 4. Its not very big but also gives you enough extra space to put your belongings in and has a 2L bladder.  ||||| They have two options at target for less then $40 ||||| I would strongly recommend going with a genuine camelbak, I've had mine for almost 12 years and it's held up amazingly! This year I'm getting a bigger one, the 50 oz size doesn't last long enough. They don't want people bringing them to EDC with more than 3 pockets (don't know if this includes the reservoir) but the 12x12 size limit doesn't apply like with backpacks. Definitely get one with a chest strap! ||||| i would get the camelbak lobo:  [URL] ||||| dont get a brand name. Go to walmart and get their 20 dollar hydration pack.  Shit worked wonders for me at Coachella. Leeks a bit if you fill it up too full, but other than that, it got the job done for only $20. Using it for EDC too. ||||| I wouldn't recommend Camelbak, they are hard to clean on the inside. Check out the Hydrapak product line, the bags are reversible, which makes it 100x easier to clean and maintain.

4848	1,3,3,3	13	It's hard. Anyone else share this pain? SMB 1 is no joke even with the warps. SMB 3 is tough once you get to world 8. I've never had the true patience to devote myself entirely to the quest. Any tips? ||||| SMB 1 is pretty easy with warps, IMO. You only need to beat eight stages. The two warps take you to 8-1 and you just play until you beat it from there. When you get game over, hold A and press start to begin again at 8-1. It's not easy, there aren't many mushrooms so you can't make many mistakes but you don't have to start over with a game over. Once you're in 8-4, go down every pipe immediately following the bottomless pits.  It has been quite awhile since I've beaten SMB 3. You can get close to the end easily with the warp whistles and you should have the P-Wing by then. You can use that to pass a whole level and you can do the swimming trick to easily pass the boat level. That might help a little bit. ||||| I still can't beat them either don't worry  ||||| Same situation with me and SMB 3. Never got past world 8 but I plan to one day. Best of luck.
3006	1,3,3,3,3	6	I was wondering if some kind person would like to assist me in the beginning of Byrgenwerth, the white church asshole keeps fucking me up pretty hard ||||| With a bit of luck you can get him stuck in the little area to the right of the stairs outside, on the right side of the building (the stairs found in front of you when approaching from the lamp). He'll not be able to get away and you can stand on the stairs chipping away at him. Total cheese, but he's an asshole so he deserves it. ||||| Do you have the cleaver or another quick weapon upgraded? Here's my strategy with the cleaver:   - Run up the stairs to the asshole and let him attack with his one-shot magic attack. Dodge that one.   - Once he stops with that and attacks you, keep calm and dodge until you are behind him.   - Get two or three cleaver attacks in, dodge away  - Let your endurance come back and doge him again  - Repeat until dead.   I would help you, if you are EU, but I'm currently at uni.  ||||| Well, if you run past him (her?) and get the key to unlock the double-doors, that's a good start. Open the doors and fight him/her on the balcony outside.  Get him/her to the edge of the balcony (time your trick hits and gunshots carefully); you'll be able to knock him/her off the balcony, thus achieving a kill much more easily.  The above is great if you don't mind a little cheese (although it's not exactly a *cheat*, just using your brain over your reflexes...) :P ||||| It's easy to stay behind him once you watch his movements.
716	1,3,3,3,3	6	At this point, I'm not looking at Bitcoin as an investment of any type (I'm brutally kicking myself on a daily basis for not buying 200 or so back when I first became aware of them, when they were around $1 each - in my defense, I was unemployed, and being very conservative about how I spent my money); instead, what I'm attempting to do is use them to buy things at a favorable price.   For instance, I bought a bitcoin a few days ago at $425, and spent some of it yesterday when it was $450. Seems to me to be a good way to get greater value for my spending dollar.  Of course, a lot of places don't accept it yet, so I'm looking at giftcard services, like gyft and eGifter. At this point, are there any of these services that are looked at as being better than the others? Or are they all about the same? ||||| I've never used eGifter, but gyft is fantastic and I am a huge fan... Though, I haven't used it much since the exchange rate fell below $1000. I'd rather keep my coin at current exchange rates. ||||| Both seem to have a wide-selection of cards, I'd probably just get the Amazon, then use my own affiliate links to get commission for myself too.  You can buy anything on Amazon! ||||| I've never used egifter but have used Gyft several times and it's fairly easy to use. I use Target cards the most cause I can get food/clothes/supplies/etc at my local target. Also, Home Depot just became available on Gyft which is pretty huge too.  ||||| Quick follow up, in case anybody is interested - I just made a purchase on Amazon, a pair of cycling sandals (yup, I'm that guy) for 109.95. I tried gyft first, since people seem to really like them, but I couldn't get an Amazon gift card there for the exact amount; or at least, I couldn't see how. So I went to egifter, where I was able to get the exact amount. Shoes should be here Wednesday! :-D
8601	1,3,3	4	I finally got the Familiar Fez, completing the Saharan Spy set (with DR). Before as spy, I'd get about 2:1kd which is about average, but as Saharan, I'm ranking up 4:1kd.   It's hilarious how clueless some players are, when they set off your Dead Ringer, just so you can uncloak behind them. It's perfect and so satisfying.   Saharan Spy is now my new favourite class. Who else has tried YER and found it the most epic weapon ever? I wish I could make a video of it, but my computer sucks.   If you don't have the Fez, use 4 Refined + YER/L'Etranger. If anything, just trade away a useless hat for 2 Refined metals, that's what I did.  ||||| Yes, because your KDR is most important. I'd rather have a spy go 1:1 by solely killing medics close to uber than a spy who manages to kill 2-3 soldiers/demoman at half health per life.  ||||| You still gotta watch out for those douchebags who turn their spy uncloaking sounds up. Wish there was a way to stop that.

8512	1,3,3	16	Hey all, not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I am attempting to lock down a few kiosk machines.   We're a public library, and we have some machines that are meant to be dedicated to just viewing the catalog, and no general browsing. Our catalog page does have links to our social media, and so if patrons click them they can get out to the public Internet and start using the machine like a general purpose computer. We have many dedicated PCs for that purpose, so we'd rather be able to dedicate these machines for catalog only. So if we could have it so links either simply refreshed the page or redirected to the home page, that'd be ideal.   We're using Windows 7 x64 and Internet Explorer 11 (planning for Windows 10 later this year), and the user account is quite locked down already, but the browser isn't yet, at least in terms of pages viewable. Currently the browser launches the catalog page in kiosk mode at startup and, via a Powershell script, re-launches whenever it is closed.   What I've found on my own include using a [dummy proxy]([URL] which results in a pretty ugly screen when clicking links, and [Content Advisor]([URL] which looks promising, but the option is simply not in the Internet Options panel... The machines share a VLAN and subnet with the public access machines, and we don't really want to deal with a separate VLAN or subnet just for this purpose just yet.   Again, please let me know if there's a better subreddit for this post. And thanks in advance for any and all replies!  #UPDATE 29 May 2016  Not sure why I took so long to get back to this, but better late than never. The lockdowns are now provided via Firefox, using extensions [mKiosk]([URL] and [BlockSite]([URL]   PowerShell script **kiosk_firefox.ps1** (runs at deployment time as part of our MDT deployment):       #If Firefox is installed, don't install it again     if (test-path "c:\program files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox") {          write-host "Firefox is installed"          }     #If Firefox is not installed, install it     else {     Start-Process -FilePath "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\firefox_46.exe" -ArgumentList "/silent"     sleep 10     }          #Install Extensions & Settings     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\cck2\firefox\*" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\" -recurse -force       So that essentially runs an offline installer of Firefox 46, and then copies over the folder that has the CCK2 customizations (Firefox settings, extension installs, extension settings). The reason I can't use a regular online installer for it is because CCK2 configurations are version-specific, so it has to be the version that I used to create the CCK2.cfg (in this case, 46) when I copy over the CCK2 files. When it updates overnight as part of our nightly Ninite Pro deployment, the settings seem to be fine. But it has to start out at the same version.   The real magic is generated by CCK2. The wizard is pretty straight-forward when using it to configure various Firefox settings. I downloaded the .xpi files for BlockSite and mKiosk from Firefox's [Add-On]([URL] page using a different browser, and pointing CCK2 to them. The real trick here is getting the specific settings for the extensions to stick. I basically went through all of the settings on one machine, then found the **prefs.js** file, and carefully copied each line into the CCK2's preferences tab:            "preferences": {         "extensions.BlockSite.authenticate": {           "value": false,           "userset": true         },         "extensions.BlockSite.enabled": {           "value": true,           "userset": true         },         "extensions.BlockSite.listtype": {           "value": "whitelistRadio",           "userset": true         },         "extensions.BlockSite.removeLinks": {           "value": false,           "userset": true         },         "extensions.BlockSite.showWarning": {           "value": false,           "userset": true         },         "extensions.BlockSite.whitelist": {           "value": "[URL]        "userset": true         },         "extensions.BlockSite.whitelistDesc": {           "value": "|||||||||||||||",           "userset": true         },         "extensions.mkiosk.admin.lockpwd": {           "value": true,           "userset": true         },         "extensions.mkiosk.admin.passwd": {           "value": "[REDACTED]",           "userset": true         },         "extensions.mkiosk.bkp.ori.javascript.enabled": {           "value": true,           "userset": true         },         "extensions.mkiosk.config.firstrun": {           "value": false,           "userset": true         }       }     };      Works pretty well. In order to update any changes (because of course people discover pages that need added to the whitelist), I just need to update the setting manually one one of the machines, then copy the prefs.js file from that machine to the DFS share and then out to each of the others. The unfortunate part of this process is that it seems Firefox generates the directory for the prefs.js file on a per-machine basis. So I had to manually capture what that directory was for each machine, and then save them in a simple script **kiosk_update.ps1**:      copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-01\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\n4q5gvxo.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-02\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\oqwzkcok.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-03\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ex3oi74l.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-04\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\t4xxwsg5.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-05\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\d3dakio9.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-06\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\lr3rtoql.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-07\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\3jrd56sr.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-08\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\52j9mucu.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-09\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\txghozfc.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-10\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ydmsk6fx.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-11\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\jphnjqiz.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-12\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\w73zdyit.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-13\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ckoj3s86.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-14\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\8tbpnx49.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-15\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\jyam6bie.default"     copy-item "\\domainDFSshare\MDT\Applications\kiosk\prefs.js" "\\kiosk-16\c$\Users\ffkiosk\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\00hqhpyl.default"   Firefox needs to close and re-open to get the changes. We have the PCs reboot every night 30 minutes after closing, so that takes care of the that.  ||||| You might be overthinking the problem. If there's only one site (the library catalog) that needs to be accessed simply map the IP in the HOST file and then remove all DNS servers from the network adapter.   That way unless someone knows the IP of a web site they can't get to it. Also if you want to be really sneaky re-map all common sites (Facebook Google etc.) to 127.0.0.1  This has a list of common ones:  [URL] ||||| /u/actuallychrisgillen 's solution should work, assuming you've properly disabled DNS (and made sure there's no stale DNS cache entries after disabling it).  That said, you mentioned "ugly screen when clicking links" for your dummy proxy solution.  There's two ways to fix that:   A. Get an actual proxy, that simply redirects all "outside" queries to the catalog homepage; or,   B. Get Firefox, and 2 addons: one for a kiosk mode, and one that either rewrites URL's or strips links.  At a glance, it looks like [mKiosk]([URL] is the best kiosk addon at the moment, and [BlockSite]([URL] will make the unwanted links unclickable.

They weigh the likelihood that a part will fail versus the damage it would cause if it does. If it's a failure that has a 0.01% chance to happen and will cause death, versus a failure that has a 10% chance to happen and will cause death, and it costs $1M to mitigate either problem, they're going to attack the lower-hanging-fruit first. You can't eliminate all the risk and still sell something so complex at a price your target demographic can afford.   These decisions are made by teams of engineers who evaluate the modes of failure. They decide, based on their experience and designs, what the likelihoods of failure are within the various systems, what kind of damage would cause should the failures happen, and how much it will cost to mitigate the failures (by redesigning or other means). Then they present their results to the management in charge of the engineering divisions, who make recommendations to higher-ups, who make the ultimate decisions on whether to proceed or not.

Policy 2- nobody get special treatment regarding policy 1 unless there is a medical emergency)  EI- I know my service was shut off but you don't understand! We are in dire circumstances! Were living like the 1800s here and I just can't do it! I need power now!  Me: I understand this situation can be frustrating *insert explanation of policy 1 and 2*  We went back and forth about those policies for about 30 minutes.  EI- but just think about it!

8337	1,3,3,3,3	15	Hey guys, I got this game but a few days ago an am currently a level 14 Scoundrel about two levels behind my story. Though I have a couple of questions that I'd really appreciate if someone could shed some light on:  * What is a good talent-build for leveling? * What skills should I and my companion have? * What do you wish you knew when you leveled/leveling yours?  Thanks again, here's to a game with great potential! Cheers. ||||| I am a level 50 scoundrel, will try to answer your questions.  As for talent build: just keep putting points in scrapper until you get to flechette round. Choose the dps oriented talents and you'll be just fine.  I leveled with that spec and it worked great.  For skills, I chose biochem and the corresponding gathering skills.  I think biochem is very nice because I was able to craft reuseable stims, medkits, and adrenals.  Armormech, armstech, and cybertech offer their own unique benefits, so choose whichever one you want. Armstech - you'll have up to date weapons armormech - you'll have up to date armor Cybertech - you'll have better mods  When leveling: Use corso even after you get bowdaar - he's just better in almost every way.  I started using risha as soon as i got her and never looked back, as a dps companion she hits like a truck and I was able to use my defensive cooldowns to survive and kill any elite mobs.    Good luck! ||||| Sawbones until Medpac Mastery 3/3. Then go Scrapper, you do a lot more dps because the extra Upper Hands and it's a lot easier to level up, less downtime.  <- Level 50 operative ||||| I went pure sawbones and it's a bit... slow.  I mean my leveling pace seems on par with other people but the feel of combat is slower.  I'm not doing that much.  However, I'm in high demand for flashpoints.  I don't recomend going pure sawbones unless you're part of a guild or have a group of friends who want to level together. ||||| I have also reach level 50 Scoundrel, and while Jastrow has some pretty solid answers for your questions I figure I'd throw my feelings in here too.  - What is a good talent-build for levelling?  Honestly for levelling; Scrapper is the way to go. In terms of raw damage it is a very powerful class and this damage only grows exponentially as you pick up "Sucker Punch" and the ability specific upgrades for it. However, personally having reached "Sucker Punch" and it's upgrades, until I had enough points to respec and go straight to "Flechette Round" over the next few levels I put my points into the "Dirty Fighting" tree, the extra damage from the "Blaster Whip" upgrade and from the "Vital Shot" bonus DoT came in extremely useful, especially as "Baster Whip" is really your only way to proc "Upper Hand" prior to picking up "Shoot First" at level 38.  - What skills should I and my companion have?  Again Jastrow was right on the money with using Corso until you reach Risha. While Bowdarr is cool and all and can be geared as a melee tank, really when you are trying to be fighting in a close to mid range setting as a Scrapper, Corso's Harpoon shot is great for bringing the long ranged mobs into crotch-kicking distance.  As for Akavi Spaar (your last companion) for me I'm torn on recommending her. Personally she is my favourite companion as she totally is a woman after my own heart in terms of what she likes-dislikes-loves etc. However, initially she is fairly weak in terms of melee damage and it is only after decking her out in some halfway decent gear that she started to do a nice amount of damage and effective at tying up a mob or two for me.  - What do you wish you knew when you leveled/leveling yours?  I think the biggest thing for me is to not rush the game and story. Really you'd think this would go without saying but I wish I'd taken more time just experiencing what the game has to offer rather than pushing for max level. It's not that I skipped dialogue, more-over just take the time to do the multiple part Bonus Series, space combat, PvP and that the game will be what you make of it.  At any rate I hope you enjoy playing the Smuggler!

2802	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	32	See if you can guess offhand the first year two expansion teams (i.e. started in 1961 or later) played each other in the World Series.  The answer? *Never*.  And the streak will continue this year: the four remaining AL teams (the Yankees, Orioles, Tigers and A's) were all in the "original 16" teams who comprised MLB from the first decade of the century into the 1960's.  (The Orioles played in St. Louis as the Browns for much of that time.)  I've always been amazed at this factoid, and amazed again every year when it continues. ||||| The Mets and Astros (Colt .45s) were added in 1962 in the National League, so until 1969, this scenario still had a zero percent chance of happening because there were no AL expansion teams.  From '69 to '76, the chances of it happening in AL were 16% (2/12), and in the NL it was 33% (4/12), for a combined chance of 5.5%.  The chances gradually rise as more expansion teams are added, but even today, with half of the NL as expansion teams under this definition (NYM, HOU, MIL, WSH, SDP, COL, MIA, ARZ), the combined chance is still just over 14%.  All things being equal, it probably *should* have happened by now, but considering that expansion teams are historically weak for a long period of time following their inception - though this has been mitigated somewhat by free agency - this makes it an interesting factoid but not really one that should amaze. ||||| TANGENT:  I don't like that factoid has come to mean "a trivial fact." It originally meant "an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print." ||||| [deleted] ||||| Did some goofing around on baseball-reference after reading this, came to find that not a single expansion team has an all-time winning record: [URL]  The DBacks and Angels are pretty close, each just 10 games below .500.

Thanks guys  EDIT2: Place for "Wow frontpage, Hi mom" comment.  **Riot answer!** [Freljord Event Results Infografic by /u/Kitae] ([URL]  Thanks a lot! <3  ||||| I don't know if this has been suggested yet, but the 'winner' of the greatest amount of support from the LoL community might be the champion to receive a Victorious skin this season.  It seems appropriate.  It would also explain why Riot is holding off on announcing the results. ||||| I'll see what I can do to dig up some stats for you guys ||||| The results will be announced once Freljord is revisited again by a new freljordian champion or a skin I believe.

5754	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,2	9	Hey guys I was wondering if you all guys use 'Enhance pointer precision' in mouse options. I've wondering many times if pro players has disabled this options for League of Legends (like people used to do in Counter-Strike games)  I mean this option: [URL]   Greetings and sorry for my bad english. ||||| Personally, I don't have the option checked. It alters the speed the cursor travels based on how fast the mouse is moved, iirc, which changes how far the cursor moves. This can be annoying to some when the same movement distance from the mouse causes completely different results from the cursor. Makes it hard to be precise with short yet fast mouse movements. ||||| Should never use it. ||||| acording to Doublelift, you shouldnt use it. ||||| Didn't know it existed until just now and was actually somthing people put thought into, looks like people actually say it's better from what i've read. Just use what's more comfortable to you I say. so I play with it on, Unless I find some good resons as to why I should have it off I am going to stick with what i am used to. ||||| You should disable it. I doubt there is a pro player who uses it.  ||||| Turning off acceleration (which is what this is) will make your mouse movements more precise, ironically. If it's off, moving your hand a certain distance will move the cursor across the screen the same amount no matter how fast. If it's on, the mouse pointer moves based on how fast you're moving the mouse, not how much. ||||| So I should disable this option like in CS 1.6 or smth? I mean, when I move the camera with this option disabled it moves a bit slowest but I think I have to get used, isn't it?
124	1,3,3	6	Got a gift for my SO. Size was too small.   When returning the item, I was asked for the card used to pay (as always), however the card number in Android Pay is different that the physical one. The  cashier was a bit confused, even showing my card on the Phone.   After 5mins of back and forth, she did the refund, but because Android Pay says "swiped" rather than "contactless" (as Apple Pay does), she was hesitant.   Long story short, it didn't feel like it was going to be straight forward, so next time for a gift I might use my physical card to avoid that... Until cashiers get used to this new way of paying and refunds through it.  ||||| I'm trying to understand the problem with the service. It was clearly a bad training of the cashier. Nothing to do with the payment service. It worked like a charm, you resolved showing the card on the pay screen. To avoid situations like that, after the first struggle, just ask for a help of the superior.  ||||| The one time I did a return with Android Pay I tapped again. I'm not sure why you didn't do that here.

3128	1,0,1,3,3,2,0,3	12	I've decided it is what it is and its better to make the best of it.   So they don't ever offer to do bathtime, change diapers, make meals, or generally get their hands dirty with all the kids stuff ... But my kid comes to me for everything. She knows she can depend on me and I will be right there. All that bathtime and bedtime and diaper changing and sitting with her for meals, it only makes our bond stronger. We have inside jokes and funny things we do and it's really very very special. At the end our kids will look back and know that we were totally there for them and we will have a special close bond.   I can tell my husband gets a little bit of jealousy when he sees us doing something that he doesn't understand, like an inside joke thing that we do. If he ever did one bedtime session with us he would be in on the fun but he'd rather watch TV. I don't think this means they are bad people, it's that they don't understand what this means for the long term. They don't understand that putting in the time now reaps many many rewards. We don't always want to be doing these tasks day in and day out but we will be rewarded in the end, and we will have no regrets.   EDIT. Dude. What the hell happened to this sub? I feel like I'm on that other sub based on the replies here.  ||||| This might be a totally different situation from yours but here goes: my SO and I got together after baby dady left us when the LO was 6months. And he's been trying to establish a bond but sometimes falls short for one reason or another (I mean, don't we all?) when I notice this I address it and TELL HIM how important these things will be in the long term. This may spark a debate and he may get defensive thinking I'm just being critical but you know what? I see him try harder and harder every time I say 'you're not interactive enough' because he cares. All husbands typically care enough to put in more effort if theyre faced with the probable lack of bonding. And trust me... You, in the long run, will see that if your LO is all team mom with no team dad, the tension will weigh on her, you, and him. There is my two sense. Best wishes. ||||| My husband was like that. And now all our kids (16,14,10 and 8) never come to him for anything and he gets mad like its my fault. I death with everything while they were little. All the vomit and high fevers. All the nightmares where I had to crawl into their bed with them. My kids will talk to dad but if they have an issue its me that they ask. I tried to tell him this years ago but it fell on deaf ears. He's trying more now but it might just be too late.  ||||| I think it is always great to find a silver lining in not so great situations. However, if this is irreparably damaging your relationship with your husband, I don't know that "accepting" it is the longterm answer.    I was so resentful at the lack of equality in parenting that it was affecting my marriage.  And because I still wanted to be married to my best friend, I made it known loud and clear how unhappy I was.    He did change.  It tooks several heart to hearts and heated arguments though.  And for awhile I felt anything but close to him.  If you have already tried everything (which I am sure you have), it is very powerful for you and your mental health that you can accept this.   ||||| This sub wasn't created for everyone just to nod and agree with the OP.  I like this sub because people serve it straight up, whether you want to hear it or not.  ||||| Do you work? Just asking cause if you do and you're ok with doing the lions share of the kid / house stuff, you are wayyyyyy more tolerant than I am! It's taken six years for me to get my husband to be even somewhat cognizant of how he needs to be a partner at home. I blame it on the role model he had-- his dad is a total slob around the house.  ||||| >I don't think this means they are bad people  I kinda think it does?  ||||| So instead of getting mad, you could just start looking at them with pity in your eyes.  "That's right, baby. I [change your diaper/feed you/cuddle you to sleep] because I love you. Mommy loves you more than Daddy does."

5592	1,2,2	10	Hi all,  I was an idiot last year and drove drunk. I got caught and slapped with a misdemeanor DUI (deservedly so). I am currently finishing a deferred sentence plea where once all conditions are met by the end of April the charge is dismissed. I regret what I did, and that I put other people in danger, and I want to move on with my life. I am eligible for expungement a year from April and intend to do so.  I work in a white collar environment and I am considering seeking a new position within the next 6 months to a year (I have worked in this field, project management, for nearly 2 years now). I understand that I won't get anywhere with the job search until my case is dismissed in April, but is this something that I can overcome with employers after it is dismissed? How should I approach it on a background check?  What about companies that run DMV checks (DMV record can't be expunged)? If it is expunged, but the company would see it through the DMV record, are jobs that do not require driving allowed to consider it?  Thanks for your time! ||||| How old is it?  If it's older, I don't see why it would be an issue. If it is more recent, it is going to depend upon the specific type of work that you do. White collar office work that doesn't require driving shouldn't be a problem.   Also, get a copy of your record run for yourself to verify that it has been expunged. So many people say that charges were expunged, but they still show on their record.  ||||| [deleted]
7749	1,0,3,1	7	[deleted] ||||| Sorry to disagree, but there are times I've been a theater where everyone started clapping together, and it was kind of awesome.  Examples:  Watching Castaway in St. Louis.  Everyone started cheering when the (former) wife mentioned that Nashville had their own team and almost won the super bowl.  The Rams beat the Titans that year.  Watching Star Wars Episode II.  EVERYONE got super excited as soon as Yoda walked in to challenge Count Dooku.    Snakes on a Plane.  The atmosphere for this movie was really, REALLY casual.  Everyone knew the movie was a joke, and everyone was there for the fun of it.  We all cheered and clapped when Sam Jackson said the line "I've HAD it with these MUTHAFUCKIN' snakes on the MUTHAFUCKIN' Plane!"  We all about died.  That being said, yes.  People who clap when it's not an obvious moment for everyone to do so should be shot.   ||||| I have honestly never heard anyone clap in a cinema, ever. I'm pretty sure it would really annoy me though. ||||| I'll preface this saying that I hate comic book movies.   I went to see iron man 3 with a girl cuz she wanted to see it. I sat there the whole time trying to get into it but it was so fucking stupid. Why didn't he just call all the other suits to help him an hour earlier so I could get te fuck out of there.   Anyways afterwards everyone was clapping at the credits. What the fuck are you clapping for motherfuckers? The fat guy from swingers wasn't sitting in the front row gauging your reactions. Jesus Christ what a bunch of dorks. 
7143	1,3,3,3	4	[empty] ||||| I have most of the remastered editions as well as the originals, but I'm not a music buff in any way, and I'm quite young to boot, so my hearing and/or judgement might be different than normal, so take this with a bit more than a grain of salt.   All the remastered versions sound the same to me. Exactly the same, except for Animals and Atom Heart Mother. Dogs has improved quite a lot, and AHM has become clearer with If being a bit louder and Summer of 68' having a bit more of a kick to it.  Dark Side of the Moon, though, in my opinion actually sounds a tad worse. Some parts you can make out are clipped a bit in frequency, and the previous remaster is generally a better one overall. Not much of difference, but the tone in some parts sound a bit damp.   Final verdict: for the most part it's exactly the same to the untrained or partially trained year. The big three albums have near to no changes. Only the early albums are improved a bit, especially Atom Heart Mother. Based on these, it's totally up to you what you would want to buy, but I personally would get the new remaster. ||||| I agree with others that the remastered Animals is much much better. Dark Side and Wish you were here sound the same to me. If you want the best DSOTM the 2003 Super Audio CD or disk 3 from $130 DSOTM immersion pack would be the best because both have HD audio (higher bit-rate) and are in 5.1 surround sound. The problem with the Super Audio CD is that you need a super cd player to get the HD audio. I’ve only bought Dark Side, Animals and Wish you were here so that is all that I can comment on. ||||| Opinion only, though a lot seem to agree.  DSTOM and Wish You Were Here both sound far better IMO than the originals. I have played both one after another for comparison and stand by my opinion.  The Wall, however is a different kettle of fish. The new print has too much bass and whilst I have heard this is more in tune to how they wanted it in the first place, I don't like it as much as the original. It does sound different due to the bass but perhaps you will enjoy it, some do, some don't.  Short version: DSOTM, WYWH are both better, Wall is worse if you dislike bass.

I sold 2 gold for the 4 silver. I ended up getting 75k. It will cost a lot to get lucky.  ||||| 4 gold badges is about 24k. 6 silver badges is 12k. Bronze badges should be free if you play solo challenges ||||| I've done 2 largequicksells and have gotten 1k and 5k, they are so not worth it ||||| Absolutely do no t pay for the badges.

5746	1,0,3	5	Okay so this match seemed to go down hill from champ select due to one of our players not talking to the rest. Our second pick asked him if was okay with support as he was Sona but not yet locked in. He didn't respond and the timer ran out and was forced to lock-in Sona. For our lanes we had Top: Tryndamere Mid: Yi Jungle(Me): Evelynn Support: Sona and as we get to adc as our 5th pick choose he was gonna support teemo. He insta-locked him and we are all yelling at him as Sona is going gg thanks to this idiot. The match starts i get blue and everything seems like it will go down hill. Or so we thought. Tryndamere managed to get 1st blood and right after Ezreal was killed by both Sona and Teemo with Volibear running away. No point in ganking bot so i go mid. Yi was out of mana but was going "bruiser yi" and we managed to kill Heimerdinger. All the lanes are doing really well including bot lane and they are some how shutting them down hard. I deiced to camp mid and it works with me and Yi always leaving with 200hp or less. Ezreal deiced to rage quit and no move from the Fountain and Garen who was Top. We some how ended up winning by something like 27-9 and Tryndamere getting a perfect game. I hope the people i played with see this. ||||| TBH you should hope they don't see this.

4253	1,3,3,3	6	Hello. I'm working on researching a senior design project for ECE and we must do something embedded. We wanted to do a chess playing robot crane. After doing some research, I'm not sure how feasible it will be. Most of the open source implementations I've seen are written in C++, but I did find one in C (It's called crafty). It has multiple files and is decently large.   I was thinking the only way that this would really make sense is to have a separate MC dedicated to "chess AI" and a separate one dedicated to control. Does this make sense? Do you think modern MCs can handle this? Any ideas which ones to research?  I'm just doing some preliminary research so please let me know thank you.  ||||| You can run C++ on many embedded targets.  A quick Google search shows that someone implemented an Arduino (Atmel AVR) chess AI and released it under Creative Commons (which means that you can use it, as long as you don't claim to have written it: please read and understand the full license):    [URL]  You could probably use it as a base, feeding it the other user's move and then using the output to drive your motion algorithms. ||||| As an "embedded guy," I'd worry a lot more about the robotic dexterity needed to reliably move chess pieces around the board than the AI itself.   Actually, a from-the-top two-axis deal with an electromagnet and chess pieces with bits of iron glued to their heads might be more feasible than a grabber. You could control it open loop (calculate how far each axis need to move in stepper counts or something and just go there) or you could go as far as to put some sort of registration marks along the rails to close the loop and improve accuracy. You have to take care to remove captured pieces before the capturing piece moves.  Chess AI can be as easy or hard as you want it to be. Here's where I'd start:  - Random legal move - Move pieces as close to the center as possible - Always try to capture most valuable pieces, if can't, random move - Always try to avoid capture - No advanced moves like castling or *en passant* (although they're probably not that much harder to write, I'd keep it simple)  Unless a project requirement is to build a *good* AI, there's no reason to maintain a real game tree and all that AI stuff. Simple heuristics will still produce a fun product. Explain that the AI design is extensible and can be improved by "real" chess AI, but simple moves get the point across under time and budget.  To answer your other question: modern MCs are badass and totally capable of all of the above. I've used C++ very successfully on embedded PowerPC and microblaze systems, and have seen it done on others. ||||| Quick phone reply:  Yes, it should absolutely be possible, depending on how intelligent you want the AI and what uP you choose.  Also, it's very reasonable to use C++ for embedded if there  is a compiler available for your platform.  Depending memory constraints, you may not even need a 2nd uP.  Consider that the AI portion and the motion portion do not need to run simultaneously.

2708	1,3,3	4	I've been amusing myself for some time now with the idea that Yahweh, if he existed, could very well have been bullshitting. I think this idea, if shared with a believer, could be a very effective seed of doubt. Thoughts? Am I being dumb? Has anyone else discussed this with a believer? ||||| If they're a creationist who deals with the apparent age of the universe by using the "made with age" argument, they've already admitted that God is lying.  There's a saying in Christianity: "The greatest con the devil ever pulled was convincing people he didn't exist." I like to ask "What if the Devil's best con was convincing people God wrote a book?" ||||| Considering Christianity seems nothing more than a religion based off speculation (from the perspective of someone who deals with evidence and facts), I'm sure anything could really be possible. It's the attitude believers have that determines how effective your speculation might be. If they're open-minded enough to consider what you have to say, then I'm sure there's a more effective argument than that.

Also have your own stuff, but a big thing couples have issues with is the OUR stuff, get something together when you move in kind of to christen everything as an OUR situation instead of a his and hers situation. ||||| The biggest thing is that you need to have patience with each other and try not to react to irritating habits that your SO does.

4136	1,3,3,3,3,3	8	I haven't heard much discussion on this recently but it is something which has me hovering over the buy button. Are there any regular users of this plugin who would be kind enough to offer their 2 cents.  I know everybody has different methods and opinions but how does it fit into your workflow, likes & dislikes, viability in a live setting, other options?   I have some time off soon and I think much of that will be spent with the demo, still I would like to hear other perspectives. Thanks.  [LINK]([URL] ||||| Love it. Worth the money in my opinion, great sequencer, lots of fun samples and presets.  ||||| This plugin is absolutely fantastic for percussion and drums for your tracks. I personally don't really use its sequencing function, it's more for live performance. But if that's your thing this plugin is even MORE worth your money, aside from the wonderful library that I use it for. I know for one that Exogenesis gets most of their drums, (including all of their snares) from Breaktweaker. If you have the money to spare, I'd say go for it. :) ||||| Oh man...  Thanks for reminding me about the money I don't have xDD But from what I've heard it's very fun to screw around with!  and also you get a sample pack with it, and in it there are tons of snares that Au5 uses, and they're so badass.  I want them so badly, so (to me) it's worth just for the samples and some toy if you're not going to mess with it very much haha. ||||| The software is meh. Cool for making little stutters and shit but thats it. I used it once or twice for percussion thats it. BUT the sample library... Oh my god. Its so good dude, I have tons of gb of free samples and I use that in every track. Everything from house to hip hop to minimal to dubstep. Best sample pack I own probably.

I'm just saying they have allowed the 9th least total yards. ||||| This doesn't account for pace at all.  We're 4th in the league in yards per possession at 34.49 (although only 15th in points per possession at 1.97).  However in yards allowed per possession (32.99) and points allowed per possession (2.27), we are 25th and 30th, respectively.  This should be the top comment.  This is the statistic we all need to see.  [Source]([URL] ||||| People trying to pretend the D isn't god-awful with cherry picked stats are starting to annoy me. I mean, if you can't tell the D is brutal by watching a game, I don't know what to tell you. The Bears and Rams games are perfect examples of games where the D got dominated where looking at yards you would think we played well. And those are two of the most pathetic O's in the league. ||||| Too bad we had the most penatly yards by a country mile to go with all this. ||||| denver gives up more yardage from defensive penalties...just sayin ||||| I swear it's hard to believe the latter is true. It seems like we let opponents drive up the field from their own end zone half the time all the way to ours. I guess it's the time consuming scheme we use.  If we finish 7th in offense, I think that's the highest in our history. And that's in Jameis' first year, I can't imagine the future. We need Doug too though, if we want to replicate or surpass this year's offensive success next year. ||||| It's a product of our defensive philosphy.  we force long drives by keeping everything short.  drives take a long time for the opposing team which limits total possessions, which means less yards.  however, when we can't get a pass rush or force turnovers, the other team inevitably scores on nearly every possession.  this has worked out well in games where our offense scored touchdowns and created it's own long drives.  but it's terrible if our offense isn't clicking because we hardly see the ball or force punts.  plus it's really frustrating to watch. ||||| Lol i prefer the eye test. Watch and defense ranked 10th-15th and then watch our defense....ill wait. ||||| Too bad our defense doesn't consistently get stops when we need them. It seems like any time a team really needs to score their offense is a hot knife through butter.

4030	1,3,3	17	Suppose I am buying a Copper and have 2 Traders in my hand. Can I use both simultaneously and instead of gaining the Copper, gain 2 silvers? Or do they have to be used one after the other - replacing the Copper with a Silver and then replacing the Silver with another Silver - leaving me with only 1 silver? ||||| Well I think the issue is that you replace it. So either way it happens the second one fails with no target. This game doesn't have simultaneously action.  ||||| The same reaction card can be used to react to the same event an infinite number of times (unless the reaction removes itself from your hand, as with Horse Traders and Beggar). However, they are all designed so that subsequent reveals have no net effect on the game. In the case of Trader, you reveal it once to gain a Silver instead of a Copper. When gaining the Silver, you can reveal Trader again to gain a Silver instead of a Silver. You don't finish gaining a card until you decide not to reveal Trader.  FYI, the one scenario where revealing a reaction more than once happens with Secret Chamber and Moat. Suppose you are getting attacked. You reveal Secret Chamber from your. You draw two cards, one of which is a Moat, and then you put two cards back, so now your hand has Secret Chamber and Moat. You reveal Moat to nullify the attack. Then you reveal Secret Chamber again to put your Moat back on top of your deck.

I havent taken off the current fixture yet so i dont know the wire size but im assuming its 14. ||||| Yes, most fixtures come with thinner wire than that of the circuit. They only have to support the current of the fixture itself, not that of the whole circuit like the wires in the walls. Just make sure you make a solid connection and secure with an appropriately sized wire nut.

6143	1,3,3,3,3,3,2	40	Hi there everyone,  Before I get too deep in my background I wanted to say my main inspiration that has really helped me control my eating habits and taught me portion control came from this post:  [URL]  He inspired me to use myfitnesspal(Something I had read about COUNTLESS times online, even had on my phone, but never registered for). He also got me to reach out to TOPS, an organization I'm considering joining.  ~~~~~~~~  My main purpose for writing this post is to ask for nutritional guidance.  Here is myfitnesspal account: [URL] **USE CODE: 147  to access my Diary**  I actually enjoy adding my food to it, which is why I probably keep up with it. Having to post everything has shown me how easy it is to over-eat and how when I did that before, it really added a lot of pounds. I just didn't realize it. Now that I count out chips, think about meat portions, and measure cups of liquids, I know how much extra I must have been eating before this.    **So my specific request is:** can people go through my account and tell me how I can better my diet? Even now, I have 300 calories left for the day, and I'm hungry, but I can't think of any healthy small meals, and looking through my fridge doesn't help.  Maybe give me some ideas of other foods I should be eating. Or other general nutrition tips. As you can see, I haven't gained weight from beverages, because I don't drink them, or Ice cream, or Fast food. But I still struggle sometimes to find good healthy small meals and instead, I do turn to chips, something I love and I'm not sure if I can give up!  ~~~~~~~~~~~  My condensed Background:  For a long time I actually didn't think I had a portion control issue, but i've been very active for most of my life, and now it all makes sense why I couldn't lose the weight; I was eating it all back. I could go through half a bag of chips. Now my bags of chips last DAYS, sometimes more than a week, because I'm counting out portions.  I'm 26 years old now.(About 5'9 5'10) My last weigh in was last friday and I was 260, down 5 pounds from an all time high of 265(part of the reason why I felt there needed to be a change in my life and adopted myfitnesspal).  In my early 20's, I'd constantly play basketball and stay active. I was spurred on when I reached 20th birthday and I decided I no longer wanted to be overweight.   All the basketball and gym exercise worked, EVEN without my portion control, and I got down to 215.   Then when I hit 22, I had a really really bad basketball injury. I significantly hurt my left knee and had trouble walking for weeks after. I was pivoting and I had spun faster than my leg had time to catch up with. Some sort of ligament or something got pulled and although i didn't need any surgery, even til today at 26, my knee bothers me sometimes.  After trying to let it heal on its own and seeing that it wouldn't, with doctors not helping me, I enrolled in physical therapy, and 6 or so months later I was healed.   I was told I could then play basketball again. I was worried and wondered if I should play at my hardest. I was told by my physical therapist that I could. 3 weeks later, I re-injured myself and needed another year to get back to 100%. I knew in my gut I should have taken it slow, but i trusted the word of the therapist.  That whole experience has been the bane of my mid 20's. I love playing basketball and it's great cardio. I can and do play for hours but my body can't handle it. There's just too much weight on my left knee.  Fast forward to a couple years of not doing exercise, with sedentary University life, and you get 26 year old me. 6 months ago, seeing my weight really was out of control, I started basketball again. 3 or 4 weeks ago, I injured my knee, luckily not as bad as the first time. I let it rest immediately and I knew how to treat it from the physical therapy sessions I had.   It's fully healed now, the fastest I've ever had it heal, and last week I even was able to do 30 minutes of cardio on it with no issues.(I log my gym sessions too).  The pain, in case you're curious, is an inability to extend my leg fully without pain, or to fully sit on my knees folded like this: [URL]  ~~~~~~~~~~  As you can tell, I'm frustrated that I can lose weight playing basktetball, but my body literally is breaking down when I try. I'm also frustrated with my diet, now that I know I need healthier eating options, and i'm seeing how easy it is to go over my calorie limit of 2500.   ~~~~~~~~~~  What spurred me to make this post was today I was supposed to go workout. I didn't. I was really upset at myself. I use Fridays as a way to weigh myself at the gym, and get a nice exercise in to feel better for the weekends.   Overall I'm really disappointing with myself and struggling for healthy meal options. I can literally play basketball 4 or 5 days a week, but I struggle to motivate myself to go to the gym, even though when I get there, I do enjoy myself; I like being active after all.   Seeing as this is a lot of text already, I'll end it here, but thank you to anyone who has read this, or anyone that gives me advice. I'm pretty frustrated tonight, and I'm hoping I can get more inspiration, like I did before when I started myfitnesspal.  Thank you again :)  ~~~~~~~~  **TL;DR: Can someone check myfitnesspal account, maybe read a bit of my history, and help support me with my nutrition and fitness routine?**  ||||| > Even now, I have 300 calories left for the day, and I'm hungry, but I can't think of any healthy small meals, and looking through my fridge doesn't help.  Once a week, I hard boil a few eggs for just this purpose.  They're portable, mostly protein (so they satisfy hunger in a way that lasts), they're under 100 calories each so you can almost always have one or two and keep within your limit.   But, for the end of the day, a 6 ounce fruit salad is also filling.  Twice I week, I'll grab five coffee mugs and take cut-up watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, strawberry, and/or blueberry and distribute it amongst the mugs.  When filled, the mug has about 6 oz. of fruit in it and that runs around 70-80 calories.  Now these usually appear in my log in the morning or as an afternoon snack that won't ruin my supper.  But it's another < 100 calorie choice that won't break your budget.  ||||| Looking at your log:  At M 26 5'10 CW:265, I calculate your TDEE at 2602.  To lose 1 lbs. a week, you need a goal of about 2100 calories (with more on the days that you exercise to fuel that exercise).  For 2 lbs. a week, about 1600 + exercise calories.  So, what I did when I started was I printed out my logs.    example:  [URL]  Circle those things that are relatively high in calories or sugars, so for 12/08 I would circle:   * Basmati - Basmati Rice (White) Cooked, 390 g (1 Cup) [appears twice] * Cheetos - Crunchy Faming Hot - Limon, 63 pieces  These were your highest calorie items for that day -- and for your next meals, I would consider having less or something different of these.    For the rice, it may be having less and it may be switching to a whole grain rice.  The rice you're having only has 1 gram of fiber -- so you're really only getting the high calorie part of the rice.  A whole grain rice gives you the entire husk, will have more bulk per ounce and is more nutritious.  But one effect of this for me was cutting the amount of these carbs -- I do just fine at half of that portion.    For the hot Cheetos, one thing I've found is that one serving of chips is around 15 pieces, so perhaps you had about 4 servings there.  Start by having 15 pieces, put the rest of the bag away.  Don't scarf.  Eat those 15 pieces slowly -- make them last over 15 minutes (it takes that long for the body to signal to the brain that it has received food).    Keep going through your log, keep circling, keep learning, and keep thinking about your plan for next time.   The pizza, for example -- maybe next time it's two pieces and a salad instead of four pieces.    The Subway tuna -- that's surprisingly high for a place that is supposed to be on the healthy side -- learning experience.    Let's see if we can find a high sugar item...   wow, hardly nothing. Sugars really aren't your thing.  The highest thing I saw was the pasta sauce -- and you can technically make great pasta sauce with only a few ingredients and no added sugars, but for the little bit of sugar that you have and the reasonable portion size you had (1/2 cup), I wouldn't bother.    Anyway, this review is what I do with my own log and this is how I do it.   HTH ||||| Take my response with a grain of salt, because it is always easier to give advice than it is to get it.  I looked at one week of diary entries and one thing I would say is that it looks like you are eating a lot of carbohydrates and processed foods. I know some people are for or against carbs (I am neither).  I see a lot of white bread, white rice, chips, french fries, and so on.  A couple take-aways I see:  - Make more of your food instead of eating out (even Subway, and if you continue going to Subway try a different type of sandwich without the mayonnaise and other sauces)  - Eat a more substantial breakfast (I see milk and some supplements, sometimes a piece of fruit, add more to this)  - Eat more vegetables and less bread   Good luck! ||||| You're on the right track by coming here, tracking your food and being open for advice so that's great.  This may be similar to other advice here but you're just not getting enough substance and you can get better results swapping out some stuff.  I just looked at Friday -   * Swap out the white bread for low carb, low sugar wraps or pita bread.  If you goto the market you can find stuff that will work and then if you like it just keep buying it.  If its bread to add to a meal not to make a sandwich with, try something like this [URL] Low net carb and no sugar.  You want to keep your sugar low as you can but look at yesterday - all your sugar came from that bread!  * Get yourself a good breakfast.  Load up on eggs and opt for almond milk instead of cows milk.  Find a protein supplement that you can use for meal replacement or snacking - its a life saver.  You can either get Whey(instant) or Casein (time release).  I mix it with unsweetened (the powder is naturally sweetened) chocolate almond milk...mmmm!!  [URL]  * Find some healthier snacks.  I like hummus with carrots or veggie straws (seriously, those things are amazing - 40 straws are 130 calories).  I also like the protein enhanced peanut butter you can buy.  I get  this: [URL] - You just have to watch how much of it you eat but I keep a tub of it at home and at work.  I'll eat it with apples (pre cut because i'm lazy!) [URL] That has to be my favorite snack - its awesome!  Bottom line - you have to find some different markets, find some different foods and experiment to get healthy stuff you like to fuel your body. ||||| [URL] and [URL] are where I pulled recipes from. It also helps me to plan in advance so I know what I am eating before the day comes and I default to salads if something changes. ||||| I decided to eat rice and chicken to hold me over.   Should I get a scale to help me easily portion out my meat btw? I always struggle when guessing how many ounces of meat I'm eating.  Any tips for that? Maybe use the scale for the rice too?
3506	1,3,3,3	13	I've searched far and wide and cant seem to find some definite answers. I don't really trust my analog anymore after calibrating it, so whats everyone's go-to digital hygrometer? Also, I have a 69% and two 84% boveda packs, would it be okay to calibrate it with either of the three? ||||| I got a Xikar from Famous ($18) and it is off by about 4%, it also does not have a calibrate option. I got an off brand from BEVMO on sale for $9 that does allow calibration - it was originally off by 2% but I adjusted it.  I would not use the Boveda packs as the can be off by 2% either way so could give you a pretty wide margin of error.  I used the salt test and it worked very well for me - was able to calibrate both my BEVMO digital, my analog, and I marked my Xikar with a -4% too help me self calibrate when I take a reading.  Here's the procedure you should use:   You need a ziploc bag,  cap from water bottle (or other small container)   a small amount of salt (regular 'ole table salt)   Couple drops of water.  Place the salt in the bottle cap (or other small container). Dampen the salt with water. Do not put so much in that the salt gets sloppy or muddy. You want a damp pile of salt in the bottle cap.  Place both the hygrometer and the bottle cap full of damp salt in the ziploc bag and seal it well. (It is important not to let air on or out while the test is going on.)  Keep it like this for over 8 hours.After 8 hours in the damp salt environment, the actual humidity inside the bag will be 75%. Compare it to your hygrometer, your hygrometer should also read 75%. If not, you will then know exactly how far off your hygrometer is. If it's off, note the amount and direction that it actually reads and be sure to add or subtract that amount when reading the hygrometer. If the hygrometer has a control to adjust it (either the needle or the display), you can set the hygrometer to 75% immediately after the test.   Hope that helps!  Edit -directions borrowed and slightly altered from Cigar Internationals website as I am feeling lazy. ||||| Any that's under $20. ||||| Caliber IV for the hygrometer. And Boveda packs are so worry and fuss-free. Sure they cost a bit more than crystals or whatever, but that's the price of convenience. And really when you're keeping $1k (or more) worth of sticks properly humidified what's $8 every few months. Their calibration kit is also great... and easy to use and accurate.

Thanks for your help. ||||| I see a repeating pattern of 7 rows, not 5...  e.g. Actual(YTD) is every  7 lines.  Anyway, you can use the INDIRECT function to have the formula calculate the target cells based on the current row number...      =INDIRECT("'{target_sheet}!'!"&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,COLUMN({this_cell})+{column_offset},4),"1","")&TRUNC((ROW({this_cell})+{offset_value}-{first_display_row_seed})/{offset_value})+{target_row_seed-1}))  {target_sheet}!{target_col} :  Sheet and column you want to point at, e.g.  "Sheet2!B"  ROW({this_cell}) :  To know where to look, I have to know where I am...   Put the cell ref of the cell you are putting this formula into.  This is one of the few times a formula can self-reference.  {column_offset} :  Number of column to offset the current column by.  So if you want column F to pull from column H, you'd put 2 here.  {offset_value} :  Increment you want to skip over (i.e. how many rows on 1 sheet equal how many rows on the other sheet)  {first_display_row_seed}:  first row on current sheet that this formula will appear on, so that I know which row to start counting with  {target_row_seed-1}:  First row on target sheet to start extracting from minus 1  So, if you started in F4 and want row 7,12,17 to look at rows 1,2,3 on the other sheet and start pulling from row 69 column H:      =INDIRECT("'YourTargetSheet'!"&SUBSTITUTE(ADDRESS(1,COLUMN(F4)+2,4),"1","")&(TRUNC((ROW(F4)+7-4)/7)+68))  EDIT:  Modified to include flexible target row and column offsets ||||| Not 100% sure what you are asking for, but my two thoughts on this are:  1. If you want the same cell to be referenced in a formula when you copy down or across then you need to lock it with the dollar sign ($).  So A1 becomes $A$1, $A1, or A$1.  The first locks for copying rows and columns, the second locks columns but not rows(copying across is locked), and the third locks rows but not columns (copying down is locked).  2. If you are trying to copy a block of five cells, then highlight all of the cells before you drag or copy.    Hope this helps!

Putting, scrambling, driving, distance, accuracy, forehand, backhand, etc.  Myself, I would take the distance of most any pro player since I have a jacked up elbow, and only throw 200-300 feet most of the time.  ||||| I just want those McPutts ||||| Sextons sense of humor on the course, and the way he doesnt get frustrated. And his flick. ||||| [deleted] ||||| Putting is the single most helpful thing that's going to lower your scores.  With that said, either McBeth or Ricky's putting. ||||| I so badly want to throw like Simon. To be able to throw 500+ ft bombs as easily as he does is a dream. But honestly of the 5 or so courses I play regularly, I can only think of a single hole that is over 500. So I guess my answer would have to be putt like Wysocki. To me he is the best putter on tour. Putting is so important. ||||| Big Jerms flick is so smooth.  ||||| As much as I want to say Ricky's crazy long putts.  I think I'm going to go with Schwebby's Overhand.  It would be so fun to have those in your arsenal.  I'll take his ability to continue throwing them into his 40's (50's?) too. ||||| Definitely Wysocki, his putting has always been on point and his Forehand game has always been on top of the board.  ||||| definitely Ricky's putting!   ||||| There is only 2 possible correct answers here. Putt like Paul, putt like Ricky. ||||| probably rickys putting. i love watching him putt. either that or his/big jerms forehand game. ||||| Rickys putt and then challenge the usual gang with a big smile on my face :> ||||| I would die happy knowing I could putt like Ricky ||||| Jim Oates longevity. To play well forever ||||| Drive for show, putt for dough. McPutts.  ||||| Being able to bomb it out there with a forehand is my first choice. Any power on the FH and my disc goes anywhere but where I want it to go. ||||| If my back hand was remotely close to how consistent a pros is, that would be great. ||||| Nikko's temperament, Feldberg's forehand, Holkom's backhand ||||| I'll take Lizottes distance and Wysockis putting. WINNING!!! ||||| Zach Melton's beard.  ||||| As a big fan and very amateur player I'm going to say any part of any of there game. ||||| The fact they can get pretty much as many and any disc they want from their sponsors. ||||| I love the throwing far, so Simon is an easy choice...but David Wiggins throws bombs too so maybe him  ||||| Besides the obvious distance and putting: I want that Will Schusterick backhand roller that only needs like 6 feet of air to turn over and get down perfectly.  ||||| I'm always trying to better my sidearm, so I would want to combine the talents of Avery, Nate, and Big Jerm to form one definitive style.
1417	1,3,3	6	Hi all,    I'm wondering if there is a way to fix my Explore page so that I actually see something that I want to see. Right now, there is just an endless supply of pornstars and fitness models. Instagram says that they are showing these to me 'Based on people you follow' and 'Based on photos you liked', but I don't follow any of these profiles, nobody I know is liking these pictures, and I have never liked any of these pictures. Does anybody know how to reset the Explore feature? Or to make it stop giving me completely random suggestions?    Thanks! ||||| If you press on the one of the images and tap the 3 little dots, you can choose "show less of these images" or something like that. Do a little cleaning up with that and hopefully it should tidy it up.  ||||| Someone you follow likes a bunch of these profiles

691	1,3,3,3	8	Hi Folks,  I've been playing guitar and saxophone for many years and i used to dabble in the bass ( as much as any guitar player dabbles :) ) and in recent years i've really found the bass more appealing and want to branch out. That being said, i've been told by some folks that picking up a new instrument in your early 30's is hard if not impossible.  So my question to you is, is it actually impossible? I don't really believe so. So if there's hope, i'd love some advice on how to start expanding my skillset :)  I should mention that I learned guitar in my teens through friends, chordbooks, guitar pro magazine and hours of noisy noodling (much to my parents chagrin ;) ) ||||| Nothing is impossible unless you say it is.  If you have any foundation on guitar the move to bass wont be a harsh jump.  Grab a used fender and an amp and give it a shot. ||||| It is not at all impossible. The only reason people say that is due to the fact that children, especially young children, have a much easier time learning to play a musical instrument...but it's not as if it is overwhelmingly difficult for an adult of any age to learn a new instrument (or anything else)...it's just not as easy.  ||||| Well, if we're not in the same boat, then our boats were at least made by the same manufacturer. I've also played guitar (learned it just like you did) and saxophone for years, and about a year ago (maybe 1.5 years? It seems like longer, regardless) a  friend asked if I would be willing to serve as his bass player since the guy doing it at the time wasn't really into it and was planning on moving out of state.   So I borrowed the bandleader's bass and amp and started learning the tunes. I had a bit of a head start in that I was already familiar with most of the material, but I still had to buckle down. I found the learning experience to be very refreshing, since I had felt like I was "stalled out" on guitar for several years.   I worked to try and think like a bass player (focusing heavily on serving the song, making sure I could hit and hold the notes with minimal fret buzz and maximum sustain, learning to listen more to the drummer and less to the guitarist, etc.) and found that it came pretty naturally. I now think I was a bass player hiding in a guitarist's body for many years. I currently play bass in three bands on a regular basis and have filled in for others; I've had more gigs (good paying ones, at that) and more varied experiences in this short time frame than I ever had as a guitar player. Bass players are apparently in demand.  My advice? Set a goal for yourself that seems difficult (in my case, learning 3 hours worth of material for each new band) and then drill that shit until it's just instinct. Remind yourself that playing those 4 big strings is a different game and try to think like a bass player. It has worked well for me.   Also, I'm in my early thirties, so the "old dog, new tricks" argument doesn't apply.  Best of luck!
65	1,3,3,3,3	9	 I should be able to get Evan to 38 in a couple more days. I guess I just want to know if I just use my 7k ticket for Dellon or Eileene instead of Rudy and stick with Evan. Thanks! ||||| No. Get another 7K and transcend Evan. ||||| If you can get him to 38, I would probably go for Eileen at this stage and get Rudy some other time.  ||||| If you are not focusing on pvp, get Eileene with no regrets.   Otherwise, you have two options (depends of your team roster):   1- Get Rudy and transcend other pvp heroes   2- Get Dellons and balance your pvp team with him and Evan ||||| Sooner or later you will replace him for rudy, then yes! better sooner, that waste your time on a unit with no future
1329	1,3,3,3,3	17	Hello /r/Guitar I have been playing guitar for about 5-6 years, and I feel i haven't progressed much in any way. I never learned theory, so it was basically self learning. I wish to progress, but i feel stuck, playing the same kind of stuff, non existent variations, same solo progression, you get the big picture. It really feels frustrating.  I would love to hear your advices, here's a track I just uploaded to soundcloud to give you an idea of where I am. [URL]  Thank you ! ||||| Go down the route of improvisation. Begin learning small amount of theory and build on your knowlege over time. Playing tabs can only get you so far you need to be able to play by ear and have a basic understanding of how things fit together with theory.  ||||| A couple things hit me right away:  Try taking more pauses in your solos.  You need to "breathe" when you solo. Like singing, you cant just sing the whole time, you need to inhale. Next, there is little dynamic change in your playing.  Accent notes, and add power and emotion to your phrasing by varying your dynamics.  Play "wrong" notes at the right time.  Even the most dissonant note/chord can be made right by what you play around it. Pentatonic is great but you must know when to play those crucial out of scale notes to make it interesting and unpredictable.   ||||| I often seem to find myself in similar situations. Something I highly recommend is learning a completely new style. If you're used to soloing, lead, and playing melodic songs, try picking up an acoustic and learning finger style or some more rhythmic, chordal songs. Something else you could do is find a song you really like, even if it seem like you could never learn it, and try it piece by piece. I've learned a lot doing this, especially technically. Most importantly though is to challenge yourself, if you stick to songs that are comfortable for you that you can learn in an hour or two you won't learn much. Hope this helps.  ||||| Studying music theory has helped me expand.
3496	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	11	I'm thinking about installing a Virtual machine on my laptop so I can run software that I need for school. I'm installing a Windows 7 VM on my main desktop right now and it doesn't look to be consuming any resources at all. However that's an FX-6300. My concern is about hurting my C720. Would it be safe to install a VM on a dual core 1.4 Ghz processor? Or is that too underpowered?  Thank you! ||||| There's no realistic reason to expect it to damage the processor, since it won't overclock itself. I wouldn't expect the Windows VM to run quickly at all though - depending on what you're doing, the software you need for school might not even run in a usable capacity. ||||| Nope. I do it for work all time. I pretty much have a Win 7 VM running most of the day.  Do note that the VM will run much better if you have the 4gb c720 as opposed to the 2gb model. ||||| [deleted] ||||| You can use a VM or if you prefer you can install Windows natively and dual boot. You can see our discussion on this at /r/chrultrabook.  However, for natively booting, Windows 7 won't work, you'll need to use Windows 8 or higher. ||||| I could see that. The most intensive thing I run is Outlook.  Our company web app has a few aspx pages that only work correctly in IE.  That and a few old in-house apps that only use .net 1.1 that I cannot get to run in wine.  ||||| I would perhaps try Windows XP. Any VM will run like ass, but Windows XP will run like less ass.
3455	1,3,3,3,3	7	I made my first cheese on Sunday--paneer! I have all of the whey left over, and have been researching what to do. How do you like to use it? ||||| Use it for soup! Or use it as a water substitute when cooking rice/lentils/etc. ||||| Bread. Biscuits. These days I make tvorog/quark just so I always have a supply for my two loaves of sandwich bread per week, which take 1 3/4 cups each. Google no-knead bread and sub in whey for water. ||||| You can also muddle some fresh mint and a pinch of salt in it, then mix with soda water/seltzer for a refreshing drink. I think it's called Doogh (no idea on pronunciation), and it may or may not be a Persian thing. It's got that ol' whey protein, if you're into the gym thing. ||||| So many things! Like others have said, it's a great water substitute for cooking grains and beans as well as baking bread, making pizza dough etc. I wouldn't use it for anything sweet, though. If you have too much to use, it's best not to dump it down the sink but you also don't want to toss it on most plants - you'll want something hearty like a pine tree. That being said, even if you think you have too much just freeze the excess and use it when you need it. Whey is really good for you and makes beans and stuff extra tasty.

Any response will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks! ||||| Not in Science and Business so I can't comment on that part, but I did take PHYS 122.  Whether or not PHYS 122 is hard greatly depends on who the professor is and your previous experience with physics.

I'm currently on my co-op term as a Science and Business program, and let me assure you it is a lot of fun! You have a lot of freedom in whichever science courses you choose (depending on which stream you pick, most people end up non-specialized) and I feel like it's easy to get good grades (just finished 2A). There's also the scibus workshops that everyone in your year scibus is part of which makes it easy to make long-lasting friendships. :)  ||||| Current 4B student and science and business TA.

Due to wording, isn't almost everything sent from deck to grave and stuff is discarded from hand?   Are there any situations where the destroyed from anywhere for Fire Kings works?  ||||| Fire King Yashka, which hasn't been released in the TCG yet, allows you to destroy one card you control in your hand when he is destroyed and sent to the grave.

7545	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,3,3,3	31	I am new to reloading and would like to start I was looking at getting a Hornady Lock and Load Deluxe Kit. I don't know if any of you have any experience with it or suggest something else. Thank You ||||| I have 4 presses (Hornady LnL Auto progressive, RCBS rock chucker supreme kit, Lee C press, & Lee anniversary kit)  I like all of them for different reason, however my favorite two are the LnL and the RCBS rock chucker.  * LnL AP   * **Pros**  * solid feel and advancing  * the quantity of ammo I can produce  * quick change bushing (if I want to keep my dies ready to use in that press)  * 5 slots for dies on a single press   * **Cons**  * price of press  * price of shell plates vs price of shell holder  * doesn't seem to like long straight wall cases (45-70 and 458win mag), the cases seem to tilt in the shell holder causing hang ups at the die mouths  * RCBS Rock Chucker  * **Pros**    * solid construction  * great feedback through the handle ( I can feel something off really easy compared to my other presses)  * the resulting rounds have very little variance  * **Cons**  * price  * the primer catch (primers don't always land in the device to carry the primers to the holder, or they build up in the mouth)  * Lee anniversary   * **Pros**  * price  * average feel and construction    * spent primer catch is great, simple design that catches all my primers  * quick change bushings (if you want to leave your dies in the bushings)  * **Cons**  * the priming system can be picky  * more variance than the RCBS  * Lee C press  * **Pros**    * Price  * **Cons**   * feels cheap with little feed back through the handle  * more variance than the RCBS  * wobble in the ram arm and handle ||||| I like Lee, not because they are the highest quality product but because they provide a good product at a much cheaper price point.  I don't know if I would have gotten into reloading if it wasn't for Lee products because there is no way that I personally could have justified the cost of a Dillon or something.  Lee also has great customer service that I've only had to use once, due to something stupid I did (broke the decapping pin on a rock).  I also got into casting, again for a much cheaper, price because I went with Lee.  If you have the money, Hornady or Dillon is better, but Lee is great bang for your buck IMO. ||||| RCBS rockchucker is work, but delivers an accurate .300 Wtby, 30-06, and .308 round, My Lee churns out my .380's, .45 acp,  and .223/5.56. If I win the lottery, Dillon it is. ||||| For a single stage it's all about the Forster Co-Ax.  No stupid shellholders, no threading dies in and out, super smooth action as well.  For multi stage, I'm a Dillon fan.  Great products, great customer service, and they tend to have fewer supply issues than Hornady and Lee. ||||| If Dillon makes it, I buy it from Dillon. They make the best and back it up with a no-questions-asked warranty.  After Dillon, I like RCBS dies, then Lee. ||||| I have Lyman dies, Lyman 55 powder measure, and a Lyman T-Mag II. Here is a unbiased opinion of Lyman:  * **Pros** * Inexpensive * Powder scale is great * Good CS * Very solid metal construction * **Cons** * locking nuts are subpar compared to Hornady * Ram handle required blue loctite * Powder scale gets loose on the powder funnel and requires constant tightening.  ||||| I've owned both Dillon and RCBS presses and both companies are really great folks to deal with in my experience (I dealt with the customer service depts from both companies for post-purchase stuff).  That being said, I tend to think the route to go is strongly dependent on your loading needs. Dillon progressive presses are pretty much the best if you're loading for handguns in high volume. They have a much higher cost than something like an RCBS RockChucker but the benefit is high speed loading.  For rifle loading, presumably you care enough about accuracy and consistency to not want to do it progressively with a mechanical auto-charging system. For this, I have found the single stage press to basically always be ideal. It also frees up a fair bit of workbench space which is nice.  Note that you can buy the Hornady LNL bushing kit to modify your RCBS single stage presses so that you can set your dies up once and then always be able to quick snap-in/snap-out swaps of all your dies. I wouldn't use a rock chucker if it wasn't for this essential upgrade. ||||| Go for it, nothing wrong with Hornady. Have a couple of their dies and they work great.   Dillon 550B is the only progressive I've worked on. **Pro** Solid as a rock with very good leverage and good consistency. It was bought second hand, I've loaded thousands and it has not shown for wear. Caliber swaps done with toolheads is as easy as pulling out two pins. Then changing the shell plate. Dillon customer service gives you support for life even for simple stuff. It's blue.  **Con** Everything Dillon is more expensive. Doesnt auto-index until you go into more expensive 650. Expensive  ||||| I've only ever had one press, a Lee Pro 1000, so I can't answer your comment directly.  I would say that the idea of a powder cop die is very appealing to me.  This is a die that can detect over or under charges and will either make some warning or even lock up the press.  To me, a favorite press would have an extra station to accommodate a powder cop die.   ||||| Are you going to be doing small batches of rifle ammo or large batches of pistol ammo? It can make a difference(single stage/turret/preogressive/auto-indexing progressive). ||||| So no one owns a mec press? Was considering a used 9000GN for 12 gauge trap loads myself.  ||||| What is your favorite auto manufacturer?  What is your favorite Whiskey?  What's your favorite OS?  All you'll get are subjective responses - to a point. As with all things, you get what you pay for. What do you want? Top of the line? Functional? or el-cheapo try it out before you commit?  ||||| My personal, subjective opinion would be to avoid Lee products.  My take - most luxurious to cheapest (not least expensive, but cheap):  Hornaday Dillon RCBS Lee  And those top two slots are up for discussion.  Well, actually, the top 3. Lee has earned there position. Now, note this, all of them do the job - question is how much do you want to spend? ||||| RCBS, Dillon, or Hornady, then. Read some comparison reviews. Each company's presses have their own little quirks. Doing X will be easiest on one, but Y is easier on another press, etc. ||||| Dillon 'cause it's blue, and I like blue.

763	1,3,2	4	Hi:  A quick search doesn't show this question, so I'll ask it.  I have an assignment where I have to be able to run a 21:42 5K (7 minute mile pace) by May 20. I have to submit mile and 5K times each week.  This started at the end of January (Haven't run in 5 years), and I would run the mile on Saturday and the 5K on Sunday. This week, however, I fell behind yesterday and did both today. Would you believe it, I'm totally worn out right now. I went from 7:03 and 29:28 last week to 7:58 and 36:24 today. Figured I should get on a program.  Anyways, my question is how should I change the C25K to fit the requirements? I imagine I can figure out how to adjust the speed of each workout, but how should I change the workouts so I can get a mile and 5k time each week? ||||| If you can already run a sub-30 5k, I don't think C25K is the best option for you. However, you said you haven't run in five years, so the main thing you have to be aware of is risk of injury, and doing too much, too soon. And to be honest, a sub-22 5k is... really fast. To achieve that, most people would be running pretty high mileage weeks, which is something you need to slowly build up to.  For some more experienced runners' responses, try posting in one of the daily Q&A threads on /r/running. It's a more active sub and you'll get better advice from people already running sub-22 5ks. ||||| What kind of assignment is this? What happens if your mile and 5K results are well over your goal times between now and early May, but you nail them by May 20?  The reason I ask is that with three months to go, and no running for 5 years, I think the best thing you could do is to do the C25K program over the next 9 weeks, *keeping your runs at a conversational pace*, and then do the following for the remaining four weeks:  1. Make one weekly run a long run, and add 1K per week to it for three weeks. Keep the pace conversational. This will help a lot with endurance.  2. On one run each week, run an easy kilometer to warm up, then run 3 km somewhat faster than your target 5K pace, then 1 km to cool off. If you absolutely must have a mile time, then hit "lap" on your watch after you finish the warmup, run for a mile, and then hit "lap" again; the second lap time will be your mile pace.  3. On your other run, just do 5K at a comfortable pace. You can report that as your 5K time.  That should get you into a good position to meet your target by May 20. Remember, training pace and race pace are not the same. By doing a long run, a fast run, and a comfortable 5K, you'll be positioning yourself to do well on the 5K **that matters** while not overexerting yourself while training.  Just to put that advice in perspective: I did a 21:44 5K last April 10. My fastest run before that had been at an average 7:29/mile pace.

3557	1,3,3	9	Is it best to play Babylon tall or wide? And while on this topic, is it normally best to play tall or wide in general? Thanks! ||||| Tall. I usually go with a 4 city tradition build followed by freedom.  In terms of the BEST civ to play tall, I'll have to pic Korea. Their 2 UUs are ridiculously good for turtling to a science/diplo/cultural victory. But personally I feel that Babylon can achieve a science victory as fast or if not faster than Korea due to its massive great scientist generation  ||||| With Babylon, go tall. In general I find myself doing better in science when I play tall as opposed to playing wide. There's tech penalties once you start spamming cities, IIRC.   Whether to play tall or wide in general it depends on your playing style, preferences, types of victories, skill, etc. Personally I prefer playing tall because maintaining a tall empire is easier for me.   Regarding how to maximize Great Scientist generation, science buildings are your best bet, although you can spam wonders that come with Great Scientist points- this can be difficult on higher difficulties, however.   One of the social policies in Rationalism also gives a 25% boost to Great Scientist generation so remember to get that once you're able to. In fact, if you're aiming for a scientific victory you should focus on Rationalism anyway.  Once you are able to pick an ideology, there's a tenet that allows for another 25% increase in GP generation, so pick that as well.

Get Three all-new add-on packs for the price of two"  Now the Exclusive content it talks about is the Early Bird Special pack but that is a bonus and not techinaically included in the price. So my question is since "Clash in the Clouds" is $5.99 and the "Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2" [as I am aware of is bundled together at $15.00 for both." So where is the "saving money part of ths season pass supposed to come at"?  Just wondering. I already have it but would like to clearit up. ||||| Last time I checked, it wasn't bundled; you'd need to pay for Episode 1 and then for Episode 2, making it worth $30. That saves things up.  ||||| The first DLC is Clash in the Clouds, for $4.99.  The first part of the "Buried at Sea" DLC will be $14.99.  The second part will also be $14.99.  Just two of these costs $30, but all three individually is $35. So it's a better deal to get the Season Pass no matter what.

1365	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	I recently got a job at an office, and up until this point I had always had university food service jobs (Student dining always had healthy options), so I never had to deal with needing to provide my own meal or snacks throughout a long work day every single day of a workweek. Both my wallet and my energy levels are starting to feel the constant takeout and passable Panera salads.  What are some ways I can enter the working world of sitting down all day without hurting my wallet or my health? I'm open to any and all suggestions, whether they be the healthiest brands of granola bars or yogurt, recipes I can make the night before that don't just turn to mush the next day in the microwave, or suggestions for what to bring and what to avoid in a bag lunch. I'm willing to spend a little extra money on whole foods and healthy snacks, but money saving tips would certainly be appreciated too. ||||| I like making a large batch of quinoa salad, usually with black beans, cilantro and some other veggies. It gets me through the week. ||||| You can pre-make sandwiches, just put the meat, cheese, bread together, and any wet toppings like tomatoes in a separate bag.  I also would pre-slice veggies into individual bags and just grab one every morning. You can add a handful of nuts and whatnot to your snack bag.  Bonus points if you reuse the bags! ||||| I make 10 salads on Sunday nights.. One for me and one for my wife for the week.  I bought some decently large Tupperware for each salad.  Lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, olives, pumpkin seeds, olives, mushrooms, rice, beans, cucumbers, etc etc.   I label them with painters tape an take them to work.   I also buy little tubs of salsa which works well as a dressing replacement.. Although sometimes I use dressing too. Overall, I use tons less dressing, which makes it very healthy! ||||| If your office has a freezer, you can keep frozen fruit in there, and heat it up in the microwave. Perhaps add some yogurt.  Raisins are a good snack, as are nuts.   Rice dishes and pasta dishes pack well and don't leak out of the container. Lasagna is something that can be healthed up (more veggies, substitute tofu for ricotta), packs well, heats up well, is delicious.   There are some frozen meals to be found that seem to be made of real food and are yummy... Amy's, for example... and some Indian dishes. Trader Joe's has some of these.  ||||| I also like Clif bars for snack emergencies. ||||| Cottage cheese and sliced up oranges, or bananas or kiwi or any fruit you like so it's  great.

3383	1,3,3,3,3	24	Hi folks, I am looking for a 12.5" barrel for my 870.  This is for bear protection, and to turn my 870 into an all around backpack gun.  Canadaammo has them for $150, however they only have modified choke in stock.    After reading lots of forum arguments, it looks like it's fine to shoot slugs through a modified choke, many say to the benefit of accuracy.  BUT, these people aren't talking about SBS.  Will the short barrel have any effect?  Is a modified choke a good choice to shoot slugs from?  And finally, is that a good price?  Thanks in advance.  Love this board.  edit: also just noticed that barrel only has a 2 3/4" chamber.  Are there short barrels that accept 3"? ||||| Shouldnt hurt accuracy at all, the short sight radius may effect the accuracy a bit.   I would recomend bear spray for bear protection though, its alot more likely to save your life. ||||| The chamber length isn't really an issue, most slugs only come in 2 3/4"  You're probaly going to see a reduction in accuracy with a 12" barrel by virtue of it being a 12" barrel Best bet is to grab a bunch of different slugs and see which ones shoot the best, then carry those. I don't think the accuracy on a 12" barrel is going to be any worse with a mod or cyl.

4852	1,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	10	A die is thrown twice, what is the probability that  1) 5 will  come up either time?    Solution   I see two possible solution  but one of them is correct, the question is which one is the correct solution   Possible solution 1   Total possible outcomes => 6 * 6 = 36  Total number of favourable outcomes as per our requirement:-  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (6,5)  Total favourable outcomes therefore = 11  Therefore 5 comes either time = 11/36    Possible solution 2   Possibility of getting 5 when the first die is rolled = 1/6 Possibility of getting 5 when the 2nd die is  rolled = 1/6  1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36   Which solution do you think is correct?   ||||| You actually have to work the opposite direction.  What is the chance of a 5 *not* coming up the first time?  5/6.   What's the chance of a 5 *not* coming up the second time?  5/6.  Multiply these two together = 0.6944  1-0.6944 = 0.3055.  So a 30.55% chance of it coming up at least once.  30.55% = 11/36, so your first solution is correct.  It also makes more sense. Think about it logically. If your chance of rolling and getting a 5 the first time is 1/5, how could the chance possibly be lower if you rolled twice? ||||| Your second solution is the odds of 5 coming up twice, not at least once. You actually want to add them together, then subtract the case where they both come up as 5.  1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 12/36  12/36 - 1/36 = 11/36  This solution is along this line of thought: add the chances of the first die being five to the chances of the second die being five, but don't count the case where both are five twice. ||||| The counting approach is of course correct, if you count all the possibilities there isn't much that can go wrong.  The correct math comes from the realization that there's three scenarios with different probabilities that fall under getting at least one 5:  - The first roll is 5 *but the second is not*. The probability of getting anything but 5 is of course 5/6, so the total probability of this case is 1/6 * 5/6 = 5/36. - The first roll is not 5 but the second one is. This is of course symmetric to the first situation and has probability 5/6 * 1/6 = 5/36. - Both rolls are 5, with probability 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.  Adding the probabilities gives 5/36 + 5/36 + 1/36 = 11/36.  A quicker way to get to the number is to realise that getting *at least one 5* is the opposite of getting *no 5 at all*. Therefore they have complementary probabilities: if getting no 5 has probability x, getting at least one 5 has probability 1 - x.  The probability of getting no 5 in two rolls is 5/6 * 5/6 = 25/36, and the complement is 1 - 25/36 = 11/36, which is again the desired result.  Hope this helps give you some insight in the way to approach these problems. ||||| If you don't feel like doing the math, just use anydice.com. Really helpful when it starts getting more complicated.  [URL] ||||| How does this have to do with game design? Is this part of a game or concept? Testing? ||||| [URL]  The second one is incorrect. That is the probability of the two events occuring.  P(5&5)=1/36  P(5|5)=P(5)+P(5)-P(5&5)=2/6 - 1/36 = 11/36 ||||| 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 is the probability that you get a 5 in the first roll AND the second roll.

A few hundred dollars of you back and ass?  Or ask your employer about getting an adjustable standup desk.  Then you can stand up when your back gets sore, and then sit down when you're tired. ||||| Try to be leaning backwards a bit instead of sitting up completely straight or slouching forward. Getting up about once an hour is also helpful. ||||| We are required to work with HR to get our environment ergonomically set up, and it is re-evaluated every year.   That being said, I have horrible posture. I have a real comfy chair. I plop into it, lean back all the way, and push my entire body forward so that most of the chair and most of my body (from halfway down my chest to my ankles) is *under* the desk.  Actually come to think of it, I sit very much like [this guy]([URL] ||||| Well, first of all I prepare. I check every corner of the chair, measure the value of each chair corners, and then write a program to calculate the density of my chair. If my chair density is less than or equal to the radius of my sitting organ, I'll try my best to covince my short blood vessel to be able to concentrate under such pressure, else I just calculate the area of my chair and try to measure corners again. And lastly, I gently put my sitting organ on the chair.
984	1,3,2,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,2	41	This may have been posted before, but some newer Guardians may not know of this little trick.  The First Curse handcannon has its namesake perk which, upon getting a precision kill, refills the mag and grants bonus range, stability, and movement speed while ADS. The First Curse buff expires when you reload the weapon.  Enter the Hunter Exotic gloves, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps. Its Exotic perk grants you double melee charges while offering the chance to instantly reload your primary weapon upon scoring a melee hit. This "reload" does NOT count as a reload for the purposes of expiring the First Curse buff, which in effect, allows for infinite duration of the buff as long as you can find an enemy to melee. This could come in useful in both PvE crowd control situations, and PvP as well, especially in a game mode like Rumble where there is an ample number of kills to steal and 1v1's where you can melee an enemy with one of your double Blink Strikes, Throwing Knives, or Smoke Bombs.  Edit: It works with throwing knives and smoke bombs, so you can keep your distance and still proc the melee reload perk!  Here's an example of how it works:  [URL] ||||| Sealed Ahamkara Grasps reload perk is very underrated in my opinion and especially useful in PvE. It has saved me quite a few times in the raid.   I've read here a while ago that it also lets you keep the bonus damage of Touch of Malice while removing the health drain for one magazine when reloading ToM with this perk. ||||| It doesn't proc on throwing knives, does it? That would have been pretty awesome.  ||||| Woah, now that's an SGA!  That makes it definitely more viable, especialy since pairing First Curse and Snare allows you to two shot anybody walking into your traps. Should allow for a great trapping style character. ||||| as a fan of the old Timur's Lash, would you say First Curse is a pretty good hand cannon for PVE?  Wonder if its worth the grind ||||| I eagerly await my Transversive Steps boots to do this for me without requiring me getting into harm's way. ||||| Solid advice! Been enjoying my First Curse lately and Throwing Knives are my go-to. ||||| Also, I didn't realize it at first, but you can switch weapons, the perk stays active until you reload The First Curse. ||||| How about a tip on how to get 7 headshots in a game with that awful Imprecation gun to get the First Curse?  I played Rumble and got wrecked lol ||||| Yay more secret advantages of being a hunter! ||||| Does it work if it only has a certain amount of ammo left in First curse? Or does it also work with a 0 count of ammo in the gun?
1382	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	9	So I finally got my beer kegged, and Im looking for the best, thorough idiot-proof instructions for hooking up my beer out line and faucet shank assembly etc. and force carbing my beer without spraying myself in IPA. Any one got good leads?  ||||| When you are force carbing, have the liquid disconect OFF. The tube running to the shank or picnic tap or whatever you are using may not be able to handle force carbing pressure and can leak. There is the shake method that /u/P_larker suggests, or the set it and forget it like /u/mylastnameisabadword said. I do a combo of both. I set pressure to 30-35psi, shake for a minute or two, then leave it around 36 hours and that's typically a good level of carbonation.   Once you are ready to see if your beer is carbed. Disconect the gas, or turn it down to serving pressure, purge the keg with the valve on top, releiving the pressure inside. Then hook up your liquid line and serve.  Seeing your request for idiot proof, lets go step by step:  Fill the Keg  Seal the keg  Hook up your gas, pressurize slowly and hold open the release valve on top, removing any oxygen that was inside as it fills up with CO2.   Release said valve and let the keg pressurize, if you have any leaks you should be able to hear then now. You may need to replace O-rings or just reseat something. The spray bottle of saopy water works here to detect leaks.  Proceed with either the shake method, or the set and forget, or some combination of the two.  Once you feel your beer is carbonated you should disconect the gas or turn the pressure on your regulator down to a good serving level for your setup. Experiment to find out what this is for you. Start in the 5-10 psi range.  Your keg is still extremely pressurized at this point, again pull open the valve on top to bleed off this high pressure, so it does not explode through your lines when you hook up the liquid side. Bleed until empty or until down to serving pressure.  Hook up the liquid line.   Hook up the gas line again if you had disconected it, double check you have turned the regulator down to serving pressure.  Pour a beer. If it is over OR under carbed disconect the liquid line.  For under carbed beer you can simply turn the gas back up and wait a few more days and try again.  For over carbed beer you should disconect teh gas line and regularly open the purge valve to release some pressure, more CO2 will leak out of your beer into the headspace and then you purge again, and very slowly you can lower the amount of disolved CO2. Note that if you have 5 gallons of beer, there is very little headspace, and this will take weeks to noticibly lower CO2 levels. You may just want to suck it up and drink super foamy beer and revise your carbing method for next time.  Thats about all I can think of for right now. ||||| Unless Im confused by what your asking, just keep the CO2 tank closed while your hook everything up. When your positive everything is hooked up correctly (tank/regulator>CO2 line>keg>beer line>shank>tap) then turn open the tank, set the regulator at your desired PSI and let it sit 3-5 days. It should be good and carbed by then. One way to check for gas leaks is to spray your system with real soapy water. Thatll expose any location that CO2 is escaping, by bubbling up. Enjoy! ||||| Be careful force carbing using the shake method. You can get beer in your gas line and potentially ruin your regulator.  I prefer to do a combination of fast carbing and the "set it and forget it method". I will crank the psi up to 30 for a couple of days, while the keg is in the fridge set at 38F. Cold beer absorbs CO2 more quickly than warm beer. Then I turn the psi down to 20 for a day, then down to 12 for a day, which is the correct psi for my kegerator setup. Beer is usually good to go.  I tried force carbing with the rocking method and didn't like the results as much as when I give it time to set properly. I also don't like the risk of messing up my regulator. Good beer deserves time. I remember being impatient with my setup, but you will learn that patience with beer pays off with great reward.  ||||| I do 30 psi for two days, purge, set to serving pressure and drink.  ||||| If you want to force carb, only attach the CO2 to the Keg (Tank-Regulator-CO2 Line-Keg) set your PSI to 30 (what I use, others might have a better idea), and shake.  When you're done shaking, relieve the pressure, set your CO2 to serving pressure (I use 12) and away you go.  To shake.  Set the keg on your lap and roll it back and forth (be careful with the lines though, don't tug on them or you might break something).  I normally through a TV show on my phone and watch a quick 23 min show while I shake it.  Works for me. ||||| Very easy and simple instructions.    1) Connect up the keg, put on pressure  2) Wait 2-3 days  That is it.
3589	1,3,3,3	6	I'm pretty sure my professor goofed a couple of my grades. When is the final day grades can be changed? I've already emailed about meeting up regarding grades, and am hoping to meet in person before the deadline.  Cheers all. ||||| [Registrar website]([URL] says Jan. 4th. ||||| I've heard *secondhand* of people getting grades changed after viewing their final exams at the start of the next semester or if there was some kind of severe miscalculation. So I cannot verify the accuracy of this comment but professors can definitely resubmit the grade within a certain unstated timeframe. ||||| Spoken from experience, if your professor is willing to change the grade, it can be changed up until the final class day of the next semester. However, once that following semester is up, it becomes next to impossible to change your grade without very serious administrative action.
7287	1,2,3,3,3	13	I was wondering if anyone with more mechanical/prius knowledge could help me troubleshoot what’s wrong with my car. It’s a 2006 Prius, with about 66,000 miles on it. In the past 8 years, I’ve never had any problems with it – but for the past two months, I’m been having two separate (but related) problems:  1. No matter how much gas the car needs, when I try to refuel, the pump shuts off automatically after about 4 gallons. When I try to add more gas, the auto-shutoff is triggered immediately – so to fill the tank, I have to stand there “pumping” the lever over and over and over for about 10 minutes, as I fill the tank .02 gallons at a time. (To answer a question Toyota asked - this happens at all gas stations,  and I’ve had multiple other people try pumping my gas for me, so I know it’s not user error.)  2. The fuel gauge is no longer accurate. For the past 8 years, the bars on the digital fuel gauge (which each represent about 1.2 gallons) have gone down about every 50 miles or so. Now, the bars go down at random intervals. The last time I filled up, the gauge still read “full” even though I had driven *for 165 miles.* The rest of the bars go down at random intervals – sometimes after 10 miles, sometimes after 30, 40, or 60ish miles. There’s no pattern to this (I’ve been keeping track for the past 4 fill-ups, and it’s been different every time.  Both of these problems happened for the first time after I tried to "top off" the tank before a big trip. I had driven less than 100 miles since my last fill up, and still had 8/10 bars on the fuel gauge. I added about 2-3 gallons of gas, and noticed that the fuel gauge didn't go back to "full" when I turned the car back on. However, it went up after about 5 minutes. The above problems occurred the very next time I filled up (at the end of a long drive, when the car needed about 7-8 gallons), and have happened ever since (over the course of 2 months, and about 3,000 miles). I've read about the 2nd problem (with the fuel gauge) happening with other cars after trying to top-off, but from everything I've read online, it sounds like simply recalibrating the fuel sensor/gauge would have fixed this (it hasn't).  Luckily the car’s computer displays my MPG – and this calculation is based on the miles driven, and the gas actually flowing through the fuel injector, so it’s completely accurate. When I need to get gas, I look at the MPG, and divide it by the number of miles driven, to find out *exactly* how much gas I’ve used. I then stand at the pump (as described above), and force the exact amount of gas needed into the tank, as described in #1 above. (Thanks to this method, I've never run out of gas - but this problem is incredibly annoying, and means that every trip to the gas station takes about 15 minutes.)  So far, Toyota is stumped. When I first brought the car in, they ran a diagnostic, and gave me a new fuel neck filler valve (from my own reading, I can see that the 2004 Prius was having the gas-pump-auto-shutoff problem, and this was the official fix from Toyota… so they must have assumed my car was doing the same thing). However, this didn’t fix either problem. They then took the entire fuel system apart, inspected it, put it back together, and gave me a new gas cap (because mine was “breathing a little funny”). This resulted in me successfully filling the tank *once* and then the problem came back.  Next, they took out the fuel canister, ran it through some tests, and said it was working perfectly normally. Then, they took out my entire gas tank, and replaced it with a gas tank from another Prius. However, this still didn’t fix the problem – so the problem doesn’t seem to be with the tank itself or with the internal bladder. Throughout all of this, I’ve also recalibrated the fuel gauge myself using these instructions [URL] but that doesn’t help either.  In summary, we’ve already ruled out the following:  1. Recalibrating the fuel gauge  2. Fuel neck filler valve  3. Gas cap  4. Gas tank and bladder  5. Fuel canister (haven’t tried replacing it, but it performs normally in testing)  6. User error  Problem #1 temporarily went away for one fill-up, right after the mechanics took everything apart and put it back together - and then the problem started happening again.  Any other ideas? Over the past two months, I’ve wasted an incredible amount of time and energy trying to get this fixed!  EDIT: Thank you everyone, for the advice! I now have an official "engineering ticket" open at Toyota, so it's not just the one individual mechanic working on it anymore - and after reviewing all of the information, the engineers have agreed that there's something very wrong, and this is far beyond the usual problems with the bladder or with overfilling. Toyota is now working with the dealership mechanic, to tell him which parts to test next.  I'm going to bring it in on Tuesday, and they're going to try giving me a new "fuel neck filler assembly" (before, they had only replaced the fuel neck filler valve).   I'll post an update once it finally gets fixed! ||||| Does this happen with a variety of pumps at a variety of stations?  I've had some pumps shut off prematurely - rotating the pump a bit, pulling it out slightly so the rubber seal doesn't completely seal, or switching to a different pump at the station has always fixed it for me. ||||| Test the 12v battery.  [URL] ||||| This happens a lot to me with an 07 Gen II. Sometimes it works to adjust how deep the nozzle is. You can also try pumping slower. Sometimes it will just not work and you just have to leave. It varies on the feedback pressure of the gas tank. The weather affects that.  Edit: The Gen II doesn't fill like any other car. It has a bladder system in the gas tank (kinda like Kramer's from Seinfeld but not same reason). The reason for the bladder system is to keep as much gas fumes from escaping during filling the tank. So pat yourself on the back.  Edit Edit: BE SAFE WHEN FILLING! If you do adjust the depth of the nozzle, don't overfill and spill gas! That is dangerous! ||||| Damn. Try posting on priuschat.com ?
4013	1,3,3,3,3,3	9	I have two dogs, one who is trusted to not be in the crate while I'm at work, and a younger one who is still not 100% trustworthy. She's a year old, and has only now discovered she can spend her day ripping her bed apart. She ate through one, a Kong bed, and I came home to an explosion of bedding all over herself and the crate. She looked quite proud of herself. I replaced it with a cheaper model, same explosion a few days later. I come home for lunch, so she's only in the crate for 4 hours at a time, and I play fetch with her at lunch so she wears out. I also leave her a couple of antlers in the crate that she likes to chew on, or a stuffed Kong. Does anyone have any suggestions for crate bedding that is indestructible?   ||||| This is going to sound awful but just don't do a bed.  We don't crate anymore but one of my dogs was a bed destroyer and I realized how often he laid on the floor with no bed no problem so I stopped putting one in his crate. He always joyfully went in when I would leave for work so i don't think he felt tormented.  When he got older we tried a bed again and he had outgrown the destruction. ||||| I just used old towels for my puppy. Even if she tore them up, who cares they're junk anyway! :) ||||| I would use and old towel or crappy blanket or nothing. It's his crate, if he chews it up, that's your dog's choice. ||||| Dogs can sleep anywhere! No need for bedding. ||||| If you want to try another bed you may want to look at [URL] They make some pretty tough kennel beds and last time I used them they would replace your bed if your dog managed to destroy them. I'm pretty sure that guarantee still stands.  
4051	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	7	Hi, I'm a newbie to the dragon age series but I'm pretty experienced with RPGs and dungeon crawlers like Diablo, Path of Exile, and Skyrim when I'm feeling solo.   I'm looking to get a new co-op game to play with my friends over our semester break and DA was one of the options we're looking into. I've already watched gameplay videos but I was wondering if there's anyone out there that could give me better insight or more detail than a regular video would like whether the co-op has high replay value and stuff. ||||| The multiplayer mode has relatively low replay value. There are only three maps (which you can get through quickly once you've leveled up) and three enemy types. It's also very grindy. I wouldn't recommend getting it if you're looking for a solid co-op experience. ||||| No, this game has got awful multiplayer (so far).  The single-player aspect is awesome though. ||||| I wouldn't recommend it as a co-op game at all.  I would, however, seriously recommend you do get it one day for the campaign. ||||| Multiplayer is horrible. No comparison to the awesome fun-times had in ME3 multiplayer. If you're looking for a good co-op multiplayer title I suggest Warframe (free to play), it's basically ME3 multiplayer refined. ||||| Thers no coop holmes ||||| Inquisition(I'm assuming this is the one you're talking about, then again what other DA game has multiplayer?) Is a great game, story-wise and multiplayer, I find it incredibly fun to play with friends or just doing the story on my own. Whether or not multiplayer has replay value or not, I'd say yes, it is a fun game even if I can't play with my friends locally.

4325	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	23	Background: I just recently had a discussion with my TBM mother over the holidays where I came out as a non-believer and atheist and it went surprisingly well. I never had the intention of hitting her with the reasons why I developed a new world view, but over the course of the discussion some things came up. Polygamy/polyandry being one. I threw in JS's marriage to that poor 14 year old girl (name escapes me)  and she was shocked. She muttered something about it being normal for the times. I didn't show her the census data that's been tossed around this subreddit, I let it slide. She mentioned that she wanted to do a little research on polygamy herself. Yada, yada, yada (no lobster bisque involved), discussion ends and about a week later I send her email in an effort to help her research.  I tell her how much I valued our chat and how I'm open to further talks and attach the CES letter, but told her to only look at the pages on polygamy; "you'd be too upset with the other stuff and may not be ready for it". I suppose, subconsciously I hope she looks at it all, but that's for another time.   She sends a reply saying, "I too am glad we had our talk.  I feel comfortable with your position and points of view and look forward to more chats about them.  And yes, I think we always should be looking for more truth and knowledge, however we have to remember everyone's learning desire and passion is set to their own personal barometer.  I will look at this document and we can have some more conversations on our findings and varying subjects.  One position I have and have iterated many times, 'perception is reality'. So for me, I strongly believe in a divine super being... that is my perception, that is my reality. Too many things have happened in my life to explain differently, so with that said, we look for further truth and knowledge.  ... Without persecution and judgement"  I have yet to respond, and not sure if I should. I guess I'm looking for advice on countering that perception is reality thing. I realize it's faulty reasoning, but I don't want to pound her on the head with more evidence, or lack thereof. I'd like to lure her down the rabbit hole a little further and have her figure it out for herself. That is, if she wants to. How do you justify letting loved ones continue to believe so wholly in something that is demonstrably wrong, harmful and untrue?  Thanks for your comments ||||| If someone does not believe in gravity, can they fly?  If you suddenly stop believing in electricity, will a computer stop working?  Will radiation not give you cancer if you do not understand it?  Remember, we had no understanding of any of these things until relatively recently in human history.  Objective truth (reality) does not care whether you believe it or not. She seems to not understand the difference between personal subjective understandings and objective facts. ||||| "Perception is reality" only works for things that lend themselves to subjectivity or things that can't be proven. If I *perceive* I don't like pesto sauce, that is my *reality.* I think whether God exists or not can't be proven, so someone's *perception* of the existence or non-existence of God is their *reality.*   But perception is absolutely not reality when things can be objectively determined. If I perceived the sun revolved around the earth, would that be the reality? Of course not. If I perceived the Holocaust never happened, would that be the reality? Of course not.   If you discuss the idea with your mom, I would distinguish between situations where 'perception is reality' makes sense, and situations where it doesn't.  ||||| She is kind of right, in a way. Everyone lives in their own "bubble of reality" the brain creates for them based on sensory input, past experiences, and their current belief of "reality."  However, that's not the point. As evidence and experience increasingly demonstrate that an internal belief is inconsistent with reality, cognitive dissonance asserts itself (most of the time). At that point, the person chooses to accept, ignore, or explain-away the evidence. Your mother chose the latter with her, "...that is my perception, that is my reality" statement.  That statement proves that you are successfully getting through to her, despite her firmly held belief JS was a prophet of god. You are on the right path, just keep it civil and keep it going.  ||||| Is there such a thing as a fact?    A fact should exist independently of perception.   ||||| I'd let it go. She's in way over her head. ||||| I think your mom is being pretty open minded. Don't come down on her like it's a fight, because then she'll get defensive.   She kinda mixing perception and observation. She says perception but then says "Too many things have happened in my life to explain differently" so she's talking about observations. She reads the scriptures and feels the spirit. She was really sick and got better after a priesthood blessing. She decided not to go to yoga one night when she felt uneasy and saw a terrible accident on the news that happened when she would have been on the roads. Those types of observations are genuine, true and useful, but a lot of us have determined their are mitigating factors we should consider when evaluating those observations.   At present, I wouldn't dig too deep into your mom. Would you appreciate it if you mom unrelentingly pushed you to think like her? Focus on your beliefs and your thought processes. It will take the pressure off your mom and she can still consider the ideas you're presenting. ||||| "Perception is reality" is not faulty reasoning, its an honest statement as to how we can only perceive one viewpoint at a time, ours.  We may be clever creatures, but we are not as smart as we like to think.  For all of our talk of science, we remember things (not in our specialty) in simplistic stories.  This is not wrong, it is just how things are done. Your friend is acknowledging that they believe in a narrative because they want to, not due to any other factors, don't be an ass simply because you don't like that narrative.  There may come a time when your friend hits a crisis and the narrative doesn't work anymore, or it becomes too weak for your friend to handle and they may realize that they need something different, but until then, don't force your friend to your viewpoint. ||||| I don't think she was being ignorant by saying perception is reality.   I think her willing to open up because she understands that has a different opinion, perception and reality.  She sounds like she is willing to broaden her perception to understand life in the shoes of the non believer.  She probably also thinks her testimony is so strong she is open to reading your information, since she doesn't understand that the church is incorrect.  Take advantage of this and open up and let her know about all your doubts.  The effects of leaving the faith.  Your journey of a paradigm shift.   I'm jealous of you actually, good luck.   ||||| "[URL]  'Perception is Reality'.  I'm okay with you thinking this boy was saved by God, as long as if I get stuck by lighting you perform CPR.  I believe that Reality is Reality and by believing as many true things as possible will generally help you live a full happy life." ||||| "So for me, I strongly believe in a divine super being... that is my perception, that is my reality. Too many things have happened in my life to explain differently,"  I interpret this as her admitting she is choosing to believe in god, regardless of anything else. If that is her approach to life, there is no hope of changing her mind. She has to first accept that her faith and perception is a CHOICE, not an overiding universal truth that applies to all people, such as gravity. If it is a choice, then why not choose Buddha or Allah or Zeus? You have extended your atheism only one step beyond your mother's to include the Mormon god.  "Too many things have happened..." Sounds like a nice way to sit back and support her faith on a perceived wealth of spiritual witnesses. Careful (and initially painful and embarrassing) inspection has shown me spiritual experiences can be explained with natural laws.  My family still equates the "truth" of the church to other truths such as gravity, water quenches thirst, the earth is round. It is a long road. Good luck. ||||| >I have yet to respond, and not sure if I should.  I suggest you let it slide for now.  She is being open and honest with you, so don't endanger that.  Pick your battles. ||||| Funny, I usually say something more or less to "Perception is reality" as the very reason against trusting our perception (bias) in favor of more verifiable methods of generating belief. Our subjective observation of reality is the least reliable means by which we can evaluate the validity of a claim. The fact that she's stating this as her principle means of accepting something just tells me she doesn't know or doesn't understand any other way of evaluating her reality. Her being willing to open up to other ways all depends on her. Sometimes asking about the "fruit" of that process can be enlightening, how has that worked for her, how has it not worked for her?  ||||| > Too many things have happened in my life to explain differently  This is pretty standard confirmation bias in action. It probably won't do much good to tell her this, though. ||||| Oooo. She's going to read the letter!  Nothing extra she says matters right now. I would nod and keep silent and agreeable until she reads the letter.  Patience will be rewarded is my guess.  ||||| I think two things must happen before acceptance: 1) there has to be truth and 2) they must be receptive for the truth.  She might get receptive in time. ||||| [Some food for thought.]([URL]

7964	1,3,2,3,3,3	13	So, I just got my rack in today from CSerpents. It's a 28qt, 3 tub rack with recesses 3" flexwatt.   My question is, to maintain a hotspot of 88-92 degrees I'm having to set my thermostat (VE-300X2 from Vivarium Electronics) at about 108-110 degrees. Does this sound unusual to anyone? It's maintaining the temps just fine, just want to make sure something isn't wrong with what I'm doing here.   |||||  I have a couple of racks with recessed flexwatt heat tape and I have to raise the temperatures to similar levels in order to get the hot spot inside the tub to the correct temperature. I think the CSerpents racks use tubs that are relatively thick as well, so that could be playing a serious part in this.   Tl;dr - I need to raise temps to similar levels in order to meet required hot spot temps with recessed flexwatt. ||||| That seems a bit high to me - where are you putting the probe exactly?  In my racks, I can maintain a basking spot of ~84-85 with a thermostat reading of about 87. The probe is taped directly to the heat tape. ||||| Yep, I have the exact same CSerperts rack, and my thermostat needs to be set to a similar temperature. It's because the heat tape is not in contact with the bottom of the tub. Radiant heat transfer is less efficient, which is why you need to set the thermostat higher. ||||| Sounds normal to me, PVC is thick, and a lot of people I talk to set their temps up similarly.  I won't be using flex watt in my PVC set ups, so I have no personal experience to lend you. ||||| You can contact Vivarium Electronics for support, general questions and other inquiries at sales@reptilebasics.com
9234	1,3,3,3	29	Luke's (metal) lightsaber is the object. No hitting or distracting allowed. Straight tug of war.  Round 1 movie magneto vs movie Skywalker Round 2 comic vs EU ||||| I would think that both rounds would go Magneto, movie Luke reaches the height of his power in episode 6, he doesn't have much feats in that film but he seems pretty powerful. However, movie Magneto moves an entire bridge at will and is able to redirect an entire volley of missiles and shells with seeming ease.   Round 2 is probably closer, I don't have many feats for EU Luke but I know he becomes one of the most powerful Jedi ever. Comic Magneto has been known to move cities if he really tries. Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rocks and steel. I'm not sure of this one, but I think Magneto also takes this one.  ||||| Magneto lifted the Golden Gate Bridge, while Luke struggled with an X-wing. So round 1 is Magneto.  EU Luke is running around ripping the engines out of battle cruisers, while Magneto is tossing around cargo ships. I still give the edge to Magneto. ||||| Round 1: Magneto  Round 2: Don't know much about EU but I'll give it to Luke.

I masturbate a lot.. ||||| the upside is I learned to never get bored. also I feel very comfortable spending time alone, so that way when I do meet someone I feel like I will be with them because I want to be rather than trying to fill a lonely void.  ||||| Nicely.

Try Simply Rarity, Bubbles, Somewhere Only We Know, or Yours Truly. Note that sadfics don't have to make you cry to be good.  ||||| The only fic I cried for was [Fallout:Equestria]([URL] twice.  Although, that was deep into the story and for characters I felt pretty highly for.  There was one point in the book (without spoiling anything it is when LittlePip finds the pony skeleton with its hoof stuck to the glass window) that after reading it I had to go for a walk.  [Eternal]([URL] was sad.  A lot of good Twilight/Celestia relationship drama.

189	1,3	9	Its really three questions under a central theme. War.

[Here]([URL] is a map of every country we have invaded/or had a military conflict in (and in fact its out of date as our troops did go into Mali). France is another contender for most wars. China again could be included, but the state of China has changed so many times its hard to pick when it became a single nation.   As for least wars there are many ex-European colonies in Africa that have never been at war. Many ex-Soviet republics have never seen any fighting since independence in 1991/2. Switzerland has not had an external war since 1815 (but a civil war in 1847/8).

5954	1,3,3,3,2	5	I generally enjoy playing jungle, and end up with the role quite often.  Unfortunately, most of my tank junglers (Rammus, Malphite, Mundo) are the type of characters who simply can't win on their own.    Despite trying to do things like typing "ganking bottom" or pinging before a gank, without help from the lane, you can't accomplish a lot.  Similarly, in team fights, despite pleading with our team to "stay with me" or "stay together", fights often start as 3v5 until our other teammates can run in, killing even the best tank.  My question is, how do you play/win as a tank when your team lacks communication and teamwork? ||||| Mundo is not a tank.  Also I can carry with Mundo top lane all day in 1300 and below. ||||| Mundo isn't a tank man, if you playing as a pure tank then that's why you can't win with him.  As far Malph and Rammus, they own solo queue low tier games man. ||||| Well imo the only current typical jungle champ who cant carry single games is maokai. He got a pretty strong cc but he deals like no dmg late. Champs like mundo or skarner are able to carry pretty well. I had the same problem with ali star from time to time, he is so stronk on his early ganks... but his late is kinda shitty ( more a support role). U need to try to get ur mates fed and hope they are able to carry you... On 1,4 ppl cant carry u even if they are like 9/0 cassio...  ||||| Why would you try to win alone? It's a team game, and you can win alone with almost any character if you are way better than the opponents.
2632	1,3,3,3,2	5	Long story short, I don't feel comfortable in my house anymore. My younger brother physically steals my stuff in an effort to stop my transition and yells at me about how selfish I am and how everything he does is for me. My Mom has hid my military ID so I can't go to my endocrinologist appointment. One time I even went on a hunger strike to get it back, and my brother did a counter strike and called me selfish for continuing. Every day there is an argument, and I'm starting to think my brother's behavior constitutes abuse.   So I need somewhere to go. I have some money saved up from student loans. I'm working on finding a job.   Problem is, I have no idea how to work this out logistically. How do I move my stuff without my parents interfering? Heck, how do I even look for T-friendly housing in Hawaii? Craigslist (without being murdered)? Can I get my mail redirected?  ||||| I'm sorry you're in that situation. What a nightmare. :/  Moving works however it works, and there's no one true way of doing it. Maybe you have a car, or a friend with a car who can help you move? Some people do that. Some people smuggle out smaller items (their own, of course; I'm not advocating theft) in the hope that their family won't notice, and then do a bigger move at the end. When I left my parents' house it was from an at risk situation. I waited until my parents weren't home, packed my university stuff in one bag, my favourite books in another, clothes in a third, and a spare pair of shoes and a blanket in a fourth, then I caught a bus with the lot of that and slept in a friend's kitchen until I could get a room.   I will say that it's easier to move out with the knowledge of your parents, but if you feel unsafe there are always options. Perhaps there's a queer or trans advocacy organisation near you who can offer other assistance. Regarding mail, I'm nowhere near you, but in most places you can get mail redirected by going into the post office or similar with ID and probably some cash. Your local postal service may also have a website with information.  ||||| [This]([URL] will walk you through changing your address. On another part of USPS's site you can even have your mail held. You could always get a PO box and have your stuff sent there. IIRC PO boxes are fairly cheap. ||||| This is a tough situation to be in, :( ...I would suggest looking out for if there is a support group of trans folk that meet weekly or monthly in your area and after going to one of the meetings putting it out there that you are in this situation and are really needing a place to go for now. I personally have not ever been to one of these groups myself, but this may work.  The only other thing I can think of, and it would take some time, is to find a job asap and start saving up in a bank account for a place of your own. Efficiency apartments are pretty cheap, and you can also find rooms to rent on Craigslist for really cheap as well.  Which island are you on? I lived on the Big Island for 6 months on a farm for work trade to stay there, and it was just in a tent but this could probably be a last case scenario for you if you *NEED* it.  EDIT: Feel free to ask me any questions you might have, I will help you in any way I can. ||||| Have you looked under /r/lgbthavens ?
2910	1,3,3,3,3	9	I'm going to buy a Jamis road bike (Femme) and I have 2 couple of questions. Any insight would be greatly appreciated:  1. I go more for distance rather than racing. I'm getting a great deal bc this bike store sponsors a friend of mine, so I can now afford the Xenith Race (Ultegra). But is this bike going to be uncomfortable for distance, since it's got a racing geometry? I could also go with the Xenith Endura Comp...  2. I ride a 49, but this bike only comes in 48 and 51. Which would be better for me? I'm 5'3 and have a 28.5 inseam.   THANKS REDDIT!!! ||||| I would get 48. You can always add a half-cm longer stem and move the seat half a cm back & up. ||||| Got the 48. Thanks you guys. ||||| Any good LBS should be able to get you on to the right sized bike. Perhaps get them to answer #2?   As an aside, what is it with the number of "is this the right size for me" questions? People should be visiting their LBS who should be providing you with this kind of service / information. If they're not, go somewhere that is able to. The LBS's I frequent all do a pre-purchase "fit" where they get you on the right sized frame for that make. And one of them gives a guarantee that if they somehow stuff it up, and you're riding a frame that's the wrong size, they'll either swap it or give you you're money back.  ||||| EDIT: 2 questions

668	1,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3	34	When I came to this sub, I was in the middle of my 1st trimester, and I sort of felt like BabyBumps was a bit like high school/college in terms of hierarchy.  1st trimester ladies are Freshman. 2nd trimester ladies are Sophomores/Juniors. 3rd trimester ladies are Juniors/Seniors.  As a Freshman (1st trimester), I looked up to the Seniors as so "mature" and "worldly". What did I have to contribue when they knew everything about being pregnant. Then when I was a Sophomore (2nd trimester), I looked back at the Freshman thinking, "Oh how sweet you just got pregnant." When I started my 3rd trimester, I still looked up to anyone in their 30wks, and ladies 36+ weeks were like pregnancy gods. They knew EVERYTHING and had suffered through EVERYTHING - who was I to complain, "Oh woe is me, I'm starting to have trouble breathing."  Now at 36 weeks, I don't feel like a Senior (more like a sweaty middle aged out-of-shape man with a beer belly, who pants walking to the car, and snores because of his weight). I look up to anyone ahead of me as a pregnancy god.   I'm not sure if I'll ever feel like a Senior :) ||||| >more like a sweaty middle aged out-of-shape man with a beer belly, who pants walking to the car, and snores because of his weight  Oh man. I loled!  I remember seeing people with flair in their 30+ week and thinking how long I had to go before I got to that point. Now I only have four weeks left. It all went by so quickly but now it's just draaaaagging along.   I also tended to read posts only by people in my "group". I figured anyone who was much farther along than me wouldn't be posting anything I could relate too. Now I read each and every post. I'm going to miss this sub :) ||||| Haha, I love this analogy.  It's been scaring me lately that there are due dates in JANUARY already. I mean, I conceived LAST January!! So weird. ||||| This is great! Especially since I've been telling everyone I feel like I have senioritis. You know, I'm enjoying the last couple weeks of just "me and SO time." Especially since it includes my own birthday. And as much as I want to meet our little guy I also really want him to stay in there and finish growing those lungs. But at the same time I am so ready to start my new life as a family of 3! I'm so restless and can hardly concentrate on whatever is in front of me.  ||||| Haha, I've felt the same way.  What a great way of putting it.  I'm definitely a senior now!  And I feel it.  I could write a book about all the crazy pregnancy symptoms... and I just might.  I also tend to crawl on first-trimester forums (like on The Bump) and dole out advice.  It's kind of a power trip.    Now, the important question is: because we're seniors, do we get to enjoy senioritis?

I thought that because Raishin is rank 100 and Frey is rank 99, they were supposed to fight. I mean, that's the reason that she tried (and failed, adorably) to assassinate him. Why did Raishin fight Loki instead? The scene where Loki talks to his father reveals that he intentionally changed his rank from 7 to 99 (Frey's), but how? If he was lowered to 99 and bumped his sister up to 98 in the process, that would explain why he fights Raishin and then fights his sister after winning, but that would also mean that Raishin is out of the competition, wouldn't it? I'm not really sure how this Evening Party shindig works. ||||| Officially, I've put this anime on hold, not because I don't like it, but because let's be frank, it's not exciting or good enough, and I enjoy this type of determinator show in concentrated measures - IE, marathoning, but then I thought to myself - "Hey, this episode should be non-stop combat", so I'm going to watch it.  **Post episode thoughts only, even if it kills me.**  Ok, I feel cheated. Sure, we had some fight, but I expected an epic non-stop fight. Guess I sort of forgot Raishin got stabbed like that. You know, I really wonder how the fight would look if we had the director and money of Fate/Illya, Accel World, Railgun S, or Sword Art Online on hand. The fights aren't really awe-inspiring, but they look alright, I guess. Serviceable is a good word.  Well, in case we somehow missed what's going on with Yaya and Raishin until now, they used Frey and Rabbi to quash any mis-understandings. Magic goes out of Raishin and into Yaya. Seems to be a banned doll thing.  The surgery was a bit disappointing, how we saw it set up as one.  Raishin and Loki as I said before are two birds of a feather, who act the same way, have the same mindset, and we've indeed seen Loki finally wield Cherubim as a weapon, which has them truly fighting together.  Well, we all know why we're still watching this show, right? The ED, which was replaced by the OP this week. A most miserable decision!   Well, show's on hold till it's done and I can marathon it, but it truly made me weary today, what with the Charl blush of cliché, the Raishin-Loki bickering which I'm too old to not notice is setting them up as friends, and the fights, how I wish they'd been lovelier, or more numerous QQ ||||| God this anime is good. I can't wait for next week to see how Yaya and Raishin deal with their new predicament. ||||| I like this show and I plan on watching it til the end, but I have to admit I'm losing interest more and more each week. ||||| This was a pretty decent episode, I'm also curious if this will have a second season or not, because right now it seems like he won't be able to beat the dude closest to wise man.

Basically, yes, there are laws over Antarctica, the Moon, and I think the upper atmosphere as well.  They almost exclusively address the issues of militarizing/weaponizing these areas.

3047	1,3,3,3,3	11	Hello ladies and gents!  I was finally able to afford a gym membership in the town I work in. And I put together this little routine, based on different sources.   First things first, my goals:  * I just want to get as strong as I possibly can. * Feel awesome. * Look awesome. * Freestanding handstands, my max so far is 10s! * Eventually an OAC. * Muscle up.  I have more or less 45-60 mins to do the main workout.   **Everyday (Outside of gym)**  * 6 sets of Chins and Pushups throughout the day, never to failure. * Muscle-up negatives, also never to failure. * Mobility work * Handstands * L-sit * Ring support.   **Main workout**  **Monday**  * Overhead Press/Pendley Rows(alternate) 2x5, 1x5+  * Weighted Ring Chins 2x5, 1x5+  * Weighted Ring Dips 2x5, 1x5+  * Squats 2x5, 1x5+   **Wednesday**  * Pendley Rows/Overhead Press(alternate) 2x5, 1x5+  * Weighted Ring Chins 2x5, 1x5+  * Weighted Ring Dips 2x5, 1x5+  * Deadlift 1x5+   **Friday**  * Overhead Press/Pendley Rows(alternate) 2x5, 1x5+  * Weighted Ring Chins 2x5, 1x5+  * Weighted Ring Dips 2x5, 1x5+  * Squats 2x5, 1x5+   **Cardio**: Tabata w/burpees on rest days.   I'm not sure my gym has rings yet, i'm considering bringing my own if they don't.  I'll be using rules written down in [Phrakture's Greyskull lp version]([URL]  I'm not sure i'll be able to keep 3-5 mins rest between sets, because 1. It gets boring and 2. I just won't have the time.  What do you think?    ||||| I would NOT do tabata and burpees + your everyday outside of the gym stuff unless you are very conditioned already from a sport or working out for a couple years.  If you are going to do burpees, only do these to start:  * Mobility work * Handstands * L-sit * Ring support.  Then maybe after 3-4 weeks if you're making good progress still then add in extra work. ||||| This looks pretty good.  Be careful that your cardio isn't inhibiting your recovery.  If you start to feel run down, drop the cardio first.  Also, since you are already doing weighted chins, I'd do your throughout-the-day bodyweight chins with a variety of grips and widths.  Nice work. ||||| If you want to include burpees, I'd use the "Viking Challenge" from Greyskull as programming. Here's how it works:  * You goal is a 3 second per burpee pace. * You will perform 3 sets, every morning * Start with 10 reps and 60s rest between the sets * When you hit a 3s/burpee pace in all 3 sets, you add 1 burpee (and 3s) to your set.  So start of with 3x10. When you can do each set in 30s with 60s rest, repeat for 3x11 in 33s, 3x12 in 36s, etc all the way up to 3x30 in 90s - at this point, move on 2x31 up to 2x50, then 1x51 up to 1x100. The end goal is to be able to do 100 burpees straight in 5 minutes or less. ||||| > I'm not sure i'll be able to keep 3-5 mins rest between sets, because 1. It gets boring and 2. I just won't have the time.  I would slightly reorder this so you can superset the exercises (set of A1, rest 90s, set of A2, rest 90s, set of A1, etc).  * A1: Overhead Press / Pendley Rows * A2: Ring Chins / Ring Dips * B1: Ring Dips / Ring Chins * B2: Squats / Deadlifts / Squats  A1 and A2 is one superset, B1 and B2 is the next. This should give you the most time
4337	1,3,3,3,3,3,2	20	This is a damn good dude, and not a hard-ass. Even as a bishop (and me as a TBM) he'd drop lots of shits, bitches, bastards, and all lesser profanities in emails.  He was my favorite companion, and there was no close second. I emailed him maybe 6 months ago to tell him we are out. Of course he hated to hear that, but our friendship hasn't changed.  I emailed him today just to shoot the shit (he's in AZ, I'm in TN). He told me he referenced me in FHE last night as someone who, on our mission, was always great at seeing & bringing out the best in people. My response was that "Like Brother Joseph, my name will be had for good and bad." He thought that was pretty damn funny.  As I expect him to be in the SP within the next 10 years, I told him that as he encounters more people like me, he's welcome to reach out to me just for perspective from someone who left. I told him I know many of the scholars who present troubling information within the context of maintaining the faith, and am happy to share those with him if the need arises.  I would love for him to begin asking the questions himself, but I see that as highly improbable. But if he does, he knows where he can find me. ||||| Thanks for sharing this. For all my complaints about the church, there are some damn fine TBMs out there. Despite our differences, I hope we never lose sight of the fact that we are all good people doing what we think is right (both in and out of the church). ||||| I love to see civil correspondence. Thanks for being that kind of person. ||||| Compassionate moderates in the church operate under their own Peter Principle. There's only so far you can rise through the ranks without becoming a hard-line member.   Still glad that your friend may still be able to do some good, though.  ||||| DAMN IT!! You leave the church...but why can't you leave it ALONE!! /sarcasm ||||| I would actually love for him to become SP. We talk a lot about leadership roulette, and as a nuanced member with you as a friend, he would have an opportunity to mitigate a lot of pain in people's lives.   Even if he ended up on the HC he could do a lot of good in derailing discipline, or thoughtful discussion and debate on excommunications.  ||||| What part of AZ? (it's my current home state)
6536	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	18	Hello!  I am currently very pregnant with baby number three and it's a girl!  We are absolutely stumped for a name.  It's so bad that if the baby came today, I think we'd have to leave the hospital with a nameless baby.    Some more information:  ~I currently have a Connor (m) and a Finley (f) ~If this baby had been a boy then the name was Jonas Christopher ~We like the names Noah and Elliot a lot.  Unfortunately, a friend of ours just named their daughter Elliot and our last name starts with the "ass" sound so "Noah Ass" sounds kind of silly ~Brenna is probably the closest we have come to a name but my wife hates that it will get mistaken for Brenda and I agree  Thanks ahead of time for the help!!!  **Edit: Thank you guys so much!  I have a lot to think about! ||||| Connor, Finley, and...  Maeve  Rowan  Isla  Reese  Maren  Emery  Leighton  Keira  Brynn  Nora  Blair  Spencer  Marlo  Adelyn  Hayden ||||| I see a pattern of last names as first names, so perhaps Hadley or Quinn?  Congrats, btw. ||||| Brynn  You seem to like the boy/gender neutral names.

I have had Starbucks baristas write Greta, Jenna, and Brenda on my cup.   However, I generally only have to correct people once.  ||||| You seem to like Celtic names.  What about Deirdre?  I won't suggest Fiona, as it's too close to Finley and could be confusing.  For what it's worth; I know a Brenna and don't think she gets "Brenda" all that often. ||||| I don't usually care hugely for unisex names, but given your other daughter has a male name (or one traditionally more associated with boys) it might be incongruous to call your second daughter something hyper feminine. Otherwise people are going to hear "Connor, Finley and Isabella" and assume the first two are boys.  Possible names:  * Rowan * Ashley * Robin * Noël * Quinn ||||| I like Brenna. I think for a baby being born in 2015, it's not confusing. I actually think a Brenda born today would have more trouble with people thinking her name was Brenna--as one seems very 1960s and one is pretty contemporary and fresh... ||||| My daughter's name is Brenna.  She is very occasionally mistaken for a Brenda by an older person, but it is an easy correction.  Most people get it right.  There are SO many names that are commonly mistaken for other names, and it shouldn't be more of an inconvenience than Brendon/Brandon or Ella/Ellie. ||||| So, I have a daughter named Rowan so with baby #2 I was looking for something Irish/Celtic which seems to be your style.

The identification process of human targets involves intelligence (to an arguable degree of certainty of course). The targets are attacked based on and after the consensus of a chain of command based on a mission objective that has the intention of reducing/mitigating global risks to various nefarious groups and people.  The aforementioned is in complete contrast with terrorism. Lets use 9/11 or ANY bombing as an example. They didn't identify ANY specific human target (in most cases, and if they did, it was based on role or office the individual holds) nor did they have any indication that successful execution of the attack would bring them closer to their objective(s).   So, Bill Maher, yes with the simple act taken out of context, this would appear as terrorism. However, if you actually maintain the context, you have a degree of rationality and strategy which is what delineates between acts of terrorism and a civilized (stretching that word a bit here obviously). ||||| Actually it was a Pagan holiday that eventually got named Christmas, it was originally a week long thing called Saturnalia where it was a "law-less" week, and was basically a pardon for the folk to torture/rape/murder other people because you know human sacrifice was in at the time and they believed human sacrifice would bring about peace and all that other good shit. My history may not be 100% on par but it's been years since I read about it.  Edit: Did a quick google on it if anyone wants to [learn]([URL] more about it. ||||| You never said which arrow ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

1125	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	15	Let's have a quick discussion thread.   You make a proposition for a possible modification or addition to Eve Online, be it to warfare, economy or something else. Others come in and discuss either for it or against it.   Here is my first proposition: Under certain conditions, allow for the players to target specific modules. For example, if a PC has a certain skills and a strong enough modules on his ships, he can aim specific modules of a enemy. Inversely, a damaged module can be fixed by the owner or someone else. That could add a very interesting aspect to battles. ||||| I really wish the fleet warp mechanics that they proposed actually went through.  I was super looking forward to doing Sniping fleets again, especially with these grid sizes. Would mean more people can get involved in fights without having to fork out for massive numbers (e.g. a sizeable Pete fleet to 3rd Party).   ||||| My suggestion actually has multiple conditions, since it is a rework of the Criminal system.  1. NPCs including Concord now go for Pods, too. (I already can taste the tears!) 2. If your Sec Status would flag you as criminal in a system (say, too bad Sec to be allowed in 1.0) you wouldn't even be let into the system, you could not dock in NPC stations, and you would not be able to resurrect at a clone in a system of that Safety Level. But you would be able to operate from a POS or daytravel via Wormhole, to spread shenanigans. 3. CONCORD no longer comes on 'first shot fired', but on 'Ship Destroyed' OR (only available if you dedicate a high slot for it) via 'Emergency Beacon'. Reason: You would be able to bring a miner or hauler down and hold them down, for a ransom. But if they wanted actual rescue, they would have to rely on players OR sacrifice a Highslot for a 'CONCORD Emergency Beacon Uplink' Module. ||||| Highsec/Lowsec to become variable, the more players rat/mission in a system the higher security gets and less concord patrols the space, the less players do these things, the lower security gets and the more concord patrols the space. Varriance will impact quality of mission/rat rewards higher sec worse < lower sec better, and can move from Low to High Security depending on usage.  Ganking/Acts of piracy will lower security and encourage more concord patrols. Concord still stays in .5+ but Empire Navies will patrol .4 and down, remove gate guns and station guns. Systems will slowly degrade towards .1 sec status if unused for missioning/ratting. ||||| I've always thought this was a cool idea, but you could never make it actually work, there's too much room for exploitation. You would have people like Goons gank 10,000 rookie ships in a system just to crash the sec and gank everyone for free.  And what would be the benefit of getting higher sec status? That reduces mission, site, and ratting rewards, leading to less people doing those things, and so the change stagnates.  No, while it sounds cool, its just not viable from a gameplay perspective. ||||| I wish the Solitude region had a high-sec to high-sec connection to the Verge Vendor region, and also that Verge Vendor region had a High-sec to High-sec connection to Everyshore.  Also, i would like to fix every region who has a constellation not connected directly to the rest of the region:  * The Spire  * Syndicate  * Querious  * Malpais  * Esoteria  It just doesn't make sense to have gates arranged like that. ||||| Remove Concord for a few hours once a month at random. Call it the purge.

5258	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	8	Hi! I am just getting my husband ready for a business trip to Helsinki. I am running around trying to find him a good coat. Would a wool coat do the trick, or is something more robust needed? He will also be wearing leather cashmere lined gloves, a cashmere scarf, cashmere sweaters, lined boots and a faux fur lined hat with ear flaps. Is there something major that I am missing? Thanks, All! ||||| He'll be fine as long as he remembers to dress in layers and wears boots that won't soak the snow or rain right through.   So get him a pair of long johns, a nice pair of ankle length shoes with a gore-tex coating, and a couple of shirts under that handsome new woollen coat and he'll be both dashing and warm throughout the trip. :) ||||| Helsinki is not a terribly cold place as far as Finnish cities go, but the wind can be a serious pain sometimes. December and January temperatures can vary greatly from one year to another. A wool coat should be perfectly ok unless he has the bad luck of being here during the one or two weeks when it's < -25C, in which case he might regret not having a warmer coat. However, a good sweater underneath will help a lot.  I assume the gloves, scarf and hat are good enough, unless he plans on staying outside for very long periods.  One very important factor is having shoes with high sides. Helsinki can be one of the most snowy places in Finland outside of Lapland (or it can have next to none, depending on the year), and the snow plows just can not in theory be able to keep the pavements clear since it may be snowing heavily all the time for several weeks. Not having to worry about snow getting in your shoes is a huge thing. You might also want to pack wool socks for him, just in case the shoes by themselves aren't warm enough. ||||| This really isn't the arctic pole. If it's a business trip it propably consists of trips from hotel to a meeting in a taxi, to lunch and back to hotel. Good windproof jacket is a good start and some shoes with good outsole. Dress shoes will be slippery outside for more than a few meters.   ||||| Wear warm stuff underneath and gore tex on top and dont forget to turn that smile upside down! ||||| As others have pointed out, good shoes are the most important thing, since streets will be covered with either soggy, slushy snow or slippery ice, and wet socks & fractures suck.  I'd suggest shoes or boots that extend above ankle and have a goretex shell or good hydrophobic coating. Detachable spikes for soles can be very nice (typically sold separately, rubbery spikey things that can be quickly drawn over the boot's own sole). Indoors, you can wear the proper Business Shoes like a boss. :-) ||||| If the stuff can hold water/snow/wind he should be fine. No dress shoes but proper boots or something on those lines
3403	1,3,3,3	5	I drive a 2013 impreza manual transmission, this morning when I took it out of underground parking into cold snowy weather, the car would jerk a few times as if I just tapped the brakes or didn't make a smooth gear shift. It was happening in 2nd 3rd and 4th gear. The jerking will go away after a while, and this is the second time I've noticed this happening. Any ideas what it could be? ||||| Take it back to the dealer, whatever it is they pretty much should cover it under warranty. Don't ignore it and let it get worse. ||||| Sounds like your clutching needs work. Alternatively it could be that there's air in your clutch line. Does the pedal engage at the normal point? ||||| That seems like a clutch issue. Could be the clutch needs work, which should be covered by the dealer, or your foot needs practice in winter.
3990	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3	37	I was wondering where to start? How to get my hands on some Doge? I dont have money to invest right now but id like to in the future.  ||||| Use exchanges like Kraken, that's all I can tell you. Here's some to get started:  +/u/dogetipbot 500 doge verify ||||| [URL]  welcome (:  +/u/dogetipbot 50 doge  ||||| Where to start? Meet us at the MOON! lol, jk. Read some posts, invest some fiat, kick some ass. ||||| Alright, I'm gonna give you the new-shibe-rundown. Please save all questions till the end.  -----  **(What is Doge? How is it made? How does mininng work? ELI5 explanation):**   Imagine a huge chunk of iron sitting in the internet. This iron is not forgable. Anyone can mine it, but how you mine it is with your GPU or CPU. Your computer uses these to send algorithms to each block of iron in a attempt to be the first person to solve it. If one of your algorithms is the one that solves it, you are rewarded with the coins inside. The odds of you solving it are VERY low(as only one block is available to be mined at a time, so everyone is competing for the same block of iron as you), so what most people do instead is they join a mining 'pool', which 'pools' together all the algorithms of the users to try and be the first to solve the block of iron. In pools, the block rewards are split based on your hashrate(how much work your GPU/CPU contributed to mining the block).   **(How To Mine):**  Mining is setting up a program to either use your CPU or GPU to try and solve blocks. Mining guide for Windows users is [here]([URL] while that for Mac users is [here]([URL]  You can also mine for free(or free for the first month basically) using Windows Azure. It is a cloud program, basically a virtual machine, that you can set up to CPU mine. When you first start a account they give you $200 worth of credits, meaning about a month of mining for free. If you set them up to CPU mine Dogecoins for you then you will get about 40-60kh/s I believe. The more efficient way to do it is too set it up to CPU mine Quarkcoin(a coin that is built around being better to CPU mine then GPU mine) and exchange that for Dogecoin on a exchange.   (Remember, the numbers in these two guides are from when Dogecoin was worth less, but also when the difficulty was lower to mine it so the numbers in these guides will be off by a bit in how much you make).  [Windows Azure to CPU Mine Dogecoin Guide]([URL]  [Windows Azure to CPU Mine Quarkcoin and exchange to Dogecoin Guide]([URL]  **(How To Buy Doge):**  **Most $ Efficient Way**: Buy Bitcoins via Coinbase(or a Bitcoin exchange), transfer it to Cryptsy, exchange for Doge on Crytpsy and then cash out to your wallet. Downside is this uses two sites and can take a few days.   **Fastest Way**: /r/DogeMarket, downside is they have a huge premium and you need to be wary of scammers.  **Direct $->Doge that is 100% secure:** VaultOfSatoshi and Kraken. Downside is the initial setup for Vault Of Satoshi can take a bit of time and they ask for private information. I do not know if Kraken has that same set up as Vault Of Satoshi, but be prepared that it might.  **(Other Ways To Acquire It):**  * Getting tipped. People here love to tip people who provide good information and content. Art. Graphics. Information. Graphs. Games. Whatever your skill set, if you can provide good content people might tip you.  * Selling goods/services. If you have a skill set, you can sell your skills or goods in places such as /r/dogemarket, stuffcoins.com and similar sites(if you go this route say so and I will find the other sites that do this stuff). ||||| Welcome to the community! Glad to have you! :D ||||| For you. :)  +/u/dogetipbot 5.75 doge ||||| you can follow where the coins are coming from using the [block chain info]([URL] .

6710	1,3,3,3,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2	41	I've been involved heavily with social VR for quite some time now, bringing quite a few rooms into an app called VRChat.  From enthusiasts to developers, there exist quite a diverse community that spends countless hours/days bringing in rooms and worlds.  Here is an excel sheet I made with almost 200 total rooms/worlds and the links to open them in VRChat.  VRChat currently support the Rift and Vive, although a headset is not required to experience the content.  **The spreadsheet below will have the room name with a link next to it.  Clicking on the link the first time will prompt you to install VRChat.  After installing you can click on any of the links in the spreadsheet again and it will launch you directly into that room.**  [URL] ||||| Zounds! This reminds me of the early days of the internet when you could go on all these different text-based MUD's ... there was one for Middle-Earth, another one for Disc World. I see a Hitchhiker's Guide room on your list that would have fit right in.   Exciting times, before we are swamped by 11-year-olds and cheating husbands.  ||||| For anyone going into the Sword Art Online room, go up close to the blue NerveGear and click on it... ||||| Thanks for this! It would be great if we had a voting mechanism for this so people new to VRChat could find the highest rated experiences quickly.  ||||| Sorry I don't have anything to test with, are these rooms where people are interested in the named topic, or 'rooms' where you explore modeled virtual environments based on the named topic?  ||||| Rawr! ||||| Tried to join with the HTC Vive Pre, but have been unable.  Downloaded the windows vive version, open program, headset turns on, i see the motion controllers and the menu floating in space - but none of the buttons on the controller seem to do anything.  I've heard trigger is supposed to give a laser selection tool, but that's not appearing for me.  If it helps to diagnose, about every 20 seconds, i'm seeing a soft white fade/flash that lasts about a second.  Any ideas what may be going wrong? ||||| I just finished reading Ready Player One, and the first thing I see on Reddit is the equivalent of Aechs basement.

4153	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	24	Finding vet dungeon groups is almost impossible.  **EDIT:** Or even adding a "group finder" channel so you don't have to port around (in the process losing group lead intermittently) spamming different zones. ||||| They have been asked, but I have not see any answer to that question since like 2 years ago. Answer was no, it will not be possible because of how the lore works.      That's still true. But if they want to break that or not, is another question.     There are quite a few players, who spent a long time, 3-4 months, in the game, but was in the "wrong" alliance, then their friends.      I've lost of a few, who likes the game a lot. But does not feel like doing their char all over again, for another few months.      So they rather quit.      * Before anyone say anything. Not all players even want to "level" up a character "fast". Even if its very possible.      * I see it as work. I'm here to play, thanks!      * OP, if your ONLY problem is you do not find a group? Um    Have you tried to join a guild? Get friends? Join in zone chat?   I am sorry, but I play tons. Unless it's 3-7 am, at any day, there is 0 problem getting a group.      If you only use the group tool and don't search for a group, then yeah.....it would not matter what alliance you where.      Most groups are made by pickup in Zonechat, friends you have or meet and guilds. Or a mix of all 4.      Some public sucks....some don't.      Most great guild members in our guild, I found doing public groups.      Most of them in a group that "failed", or had someone rage quit and leave us there needing another and having to leave the dungeon.      Have you tried that? ||||| No announced plans. I think eventually they allow group dungeons to group cross faction. They are after all run by the Undaunted which is alliance neutral.  ||||| It's tough to find sometimes, but not impossible. For whatever reason, I see a lot of people finding groups by going to the zone that the vet dungeon is in.  Personally, I don't see why not allow cross faction grouping. Especially with the Explorer's pack, people could be any race. It would make grouping quicker. So I say a +1 to you my friend in hopes that Gina sees this. ||||| True, no one commands using the LFG tool anyway.   Best option = good / big / helpful Guild.   Second option = zone chat. ||||| The LFG tool needs improvements.  For a start just selecting '6-10 VR dungeons' rather than a specific.  In addition people should be able to see the party LFG and select to join it, should also be able to let it be very clear what roles a group currently has. Not a fan of cross faction grouping, though I can see the benefits.  But when Rift allowed the factions to join together it kinda killed the game a bit for me. ||||| I really hope they do. It's a shame that areas like crag don't allow cross faction participation. The storyline has merged at that point and only pvp actually needs to remain separate.  ||||| The factions are at war.Why would you ever group with another faction ? That would completely undermine the rationale for AvA. ||||| They just need to take off the level restrictions in the group finder.  They're so annoying.  I can't tell you how many times I missed the limit and then had to beg guild mates to help me.

A bunch more ratings will be coming in after the Pilot airs though.  ||||| I think there's two reasons why it's doing so well critically.  1) Dark and gritty has been around for a while, and is kind of wearing thin. ESPECIALLY for DC products. (As much as I love them) It's nice to see that trend subverted. This is the same reason GoTG did so well.   2) It's exactly what a Flash series should be.

The problem with kayle is that although her damage output early game is hella high, she falls off a bit later on where you are required to ult the ADC or APC, leaving you relatively squishy.

Jewel kings are for selling and selling only.   ||||| Same colour fuse will grant additional experience, off colours won't  Nymphs are evolution materials   Jewel anything is used for selling to make Zel ||||| As other people have said:  Try to fuse like elements (bonus exp)  Do not fuse Jewel or nymph/spirits (evolution materials)  Also try to fuse like brave bursts (offensive, stat boosts, or healing brave bursts) because that is what levels up your brave bursts.  Higher brave burst level means more damage or healing.  Most people don't seem to know that.  It's not greatly important till later levels, but its  a good habit to learn.
570	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2	41	In the idea that if he presents you with a ring that he believes you like but don't, it means he doesn't know you and thus should you marry him?  Also if the ring is an heirloom would you say no if he knew you wouldn't like it or would you wear it as it was in his family for years?  EDIT: guys of reddit. would you get offended if the lady asked to change the ring? ||||| [empty] ||||| If the woman said no because she didn't like the ring, there would not be a second proposal.  **Edit:** That downvote must have been from my ex-wife. LET ME SEE MY KIDS YOU BITCH ||||| I'd say yes to a bit of twisted wire - it's a symbol of eternity, not wealth.  Having said that, I know a guy who bought 2 because he thought she'd turn the first one down.  She did.  He should have run. ||||| I proposed with one of those awful Ring Watch things. I gave it to her and said "This is because I hope you'll always have time on your hands for me. Will you marry me? /openbox"  Then she said yes and took the ring, not really knowing what to think of that. So I said "let me help you" and took the ring back from her... and pulled the real ring out of my coat pocket and put that on her finger instead.  She, of course, still wanted the ring watch for luls. ||||| I'm marrying the guy not the ring. I will say yes if I want to marry the guy. ||||| I should have..... but didn't.    Second marriage.  We had been talking about getting married, and I said that I did NOT want a diamond engagement ring.  There were very valid reasons for this....It would have reminded me very much of my first husband, who had passed away.  We were older, had kids, had careers, and it was not going to be a "traditional" marriage, so I did not want a "traditional" symbol.    When he proposed, lo and behold, there was the diamond ring.  I said yes anyway.  I missed, or over looked, the warning flags and sirens alerting me to the controlling, selfish, abusive jack-ass he truly was.  Things just got worse.  Marriage was over in less than a year.  Biggest mistake I have made in my life.  It isn't like everyone talks about what type of ring they find attractive.  I don't care about jewelry really, I just knew I didn't want diamonds.  He knew that too.  So if he had given me what I perceived to be an ugly ring (pearls), but it came from his heart and he believed I would like it, YES.  But, purposely giving me a symbol we had talked about, and I said I did not want..... I was a fool for not seeing the reality. ||||| A - In my experience when it was getting to that point of the relationship, it was talked about beforehand. I took the liberty of showing my man the type of style I liked. If he came home with something completely different after that, I may question it, but would still marry him. B - If it's a family heirloom and it's ugly as shit, I tell him that. I do not want to be wearing a ring every day that I hate. That being said - I am not the type of woman that needs a huge diamond or fancy ring. I would be happy with a plain band and nothing flashy. I just don't want something I find hideous. ||||| I've told my boyfriend of many years that I'd prefer just a band and **no** engagement ring. I'm not a big fan of jewelry and wearing a ring with a big, shiny gem on it just makes me feel *weird*, if that makes any sense. Of course if he proposed with one, I would gladly accept and would try getting used to wearing something shiny and bright on my finger. Although, I really, really, **really** hope that doesn't happen. *Ahem, I know you're reading this* ||||| You know what, I'll say it: under certain circumstances, I *would* say no, because to me, that could be indicative of the existence of much larger problems in the relationship, like for instance **lack of communication** and **not knowing the other person** and **not remembering or paying attention to conversations**.  For example, I'm both morally and aesthetically opposed to diamonds.  I dislike the artificiality of the demand for them, I dislike the manipulation of the market, I dislike the methods used in their extraction, I dislike the fact that they fund wars and atrocities, and I think they look like ugly little chips of glass.  I do not like them, Sam I am, and I have made my opinion on the subject clear.  So, if my boyfriend proposed to me with a diamond engagement ring, that wouldn't be a situation to put on a smile, tell myself it's the thought that counts, and say "Oh, my love, yes, yes, a thousand times yes!"  Rather, it would be a pretty blatant sign that he valued tradition and/or convenience more than he valued my (very strongly-held) beliefs, and that just doesn't strike me as a very good foundation to build a marriage on.  I wouldn't say no if the ring just wasn't quite the style I had in mind, and I would *never* say no if it wasn't above a certain threshold of price or bling - I would honestly rather have a tiger's eye stone set in a simple silver band than any elaborate ornate confection of diamond-studded yellow gold.  But if my future husband doesn't know me well enough to avoid getting something that is the complete polar opposite of what I'm like as a person, what are they even doing dating someone they don't pay any attention to? ||||| Protip : propose with a cheap ring. If she says no because of the ring, you just dodged a bullet. If she says yes, buy her a better ring. She deserves it.  ||||| Girl here: I would not say no, however I would be a bit disappointed that he didn't pay attention to the conversations we had concerning a ring.   But then again, unlike like a large percentage of women, I have asked that if he does want to propose (and I hope that he does) that he do so with a small non-flashy ring.  He on the other hand argues that an engagement ring must have a high value (at least higher than the $5,000 ring my sister demanded of her now fiance)   It actually makes my tummy turn at the thought of lugging around some rock with an artificial value that high... ||||| I had a friend who proposed to a girl... she accepted and showed the ring to her friends... they made fun of how small the 'rock' was, so she went back to him, saying he had to get her something bigger.

I've watched videos of "how to make steak" or "how to cook pasta" but got different answers from different videos.  Can I cook steak in a non-stick? Can I cook pasta in a non-stick? Questions like that.  I also want to know what types of pans and pots I should buy. (What are most useful?)  Thanks in advance guys. ||||| Since you are new, start off with an inexpensive set of non-stick from Target or Walmart. This should include a large-ish sautee pan (14"), a couple of smaller 2 quart sauce pans, and a big pot for soups, boiling water, etc. They should have lids, also.  You can cool steak and pasta and just about anything else in these, no problem. BUT: there are a couple of things you should and should not do with them.  First: Always **only** use plastic or wooden spatulas and ladles, etc. If you use anything metal, it will scratch off the non-stick coating and ruin the pots and pans.  Second: Be very careful not to burn the pans. This will remove the coating also.  In general, non-stick pans heat up very quickly, so don't heat them until you are ready to cook, and then, give them only 2 or 3 minutes over a medium-high flame before you throw the food in.  (To test, get your hands wet, and drip a few drops of water into the pan, it should sizzle but not evaporate immediately.)  Some of the newer pans have a red indicator on the surface of the pan that will indicate how hot they are.  Finally, although you don't 'need' it, for flavor I generally use a teaspoon of olive oil or butter when sauteing something like vegetables, but if what you are cooking has fat on it already (like a steak) or you have marinaded it (like chicken breast) you can skip the butter/oil.  Good luck and good cooking!    ||||| Basic rule I use to decide which pan to use  Anything I want crunchy/crispy, that doesn't start out so, or anything I want to burn a bit, use stainless/carbon steel/cast iron. Things like steak, scallops, certain ways to prepare vegetables.  Anything that's wet and/or sticky, use nonstick. Things like eggs, spaghetti sauce, and poached stuff.  Of course I don't follow this a lot of the time, but it's a starting point.  ||||| If you are really low on funds check thrift stores; a $20 pan from Target might be $2. Obviously don't buy non stick that's scratched or pots that are wobbly, but you can outfit your kitchen for $10. You can also find vintage cookware that's better quality than what you could find today on a budget. And you don't have to take cooking videos or recipes literally; like if you're cooking pasta for yourself a 1 quart pot should do.

1729	1,3	5	Hey, Marry Christmas first of all.  So, Im on my longest streak, yes I experienced many benefits, but I want to talk about one thought that has been in me since yesterday.  Since I moved to Germany, about 5 years ago, I don't have any friends. It wasn't a big of a problem for me since yesterday,but then it hit me.  It's strange, how is this even possible. It's not like I'm weirdo, I look slightly above average, people seem to like me at school and all that, but I think I've been moving all of them away. It's a little bit hard to put it into words for me, but I hope you know what I mean. It wasn't much different before I moved here, I just had bigger social circle, so I had few mates, but not really friends. It's sad for me, and I don't even know where to start, how to change it. Anything.  Even when I meet someone I like, which is pretty rare, they don't seem to have much of interest in me. Hmm, probably that's the thing, I don't like people? Idk anymore. ||||| Hey, SAME problem for me. I look GOOD, Im very muscular and your random joe would instantly think Im some popular dude.  But I havent had any CLOSE friends since 10 years ago, and now I have almost no friends at all, maybe like 1 but he lives in another country now ..

2488	1,3,2,2	5	Just a random thought -  No doubt iOS 7 is a major update / upgrade in the OS' history. No other time has so many changes (both aesthetic and functional) been implemented at one time on such a large user base.  When I first had a chance to fiddle with it, I noticed straight away how annoyingly slow the animations and transitions were. It didn't seem that the timings of these animations were optimized for every day use. What if Apple has implemented certain functions and features to ease their users into the new OS, which are designed for to be temporary and just help in the transition from iOS 6 to 7?  What if with each update, Apple increases the animation transition timing incrementally and imperceptibly? What if the UI simplifies over time and sheds certain elements such as the horizontal notification and control centre indicator bars on the lock screen, or the bar at the bottom of banner notifications. Obviously Apple would modify the OS where needed if there was enough user feedback, but maybe this has all been planned.  Not to say I think this is going on, I just think this would be an interesting concept in UI design - as the users mature to the OS' functions, so too does the UI. I wouldn't put it past Apple to be capable of doing this. ||||| Something I've noticed over the years with Apple UI, is that one version will be colorful and shiny. The next versions will be more and more muted and subtle. The they'll come out with a colorful version again.  Not sure if it's planned that way or if it's just a natural progression. ||||| What about new users who have never owned or used an iPhone before?   ||||| You think they didn't already do this with iOS 1 - 6? ;)
3809	1,3,3,3,3,3	11	So a discount store in my area (NJ) Ollie's had books 5-8 on sale for $3 each. Unfamiliar with the series, I checked amazon. Had some great reviews, saw a film is on the horizon, said "why" not and grabbed them.   Read Wind, and was steered by this sub to just go back to #1 and go from there. I'm in love. I purchased a collection (books 1-4) on Amazon for only $20 (paperback, unfortunately. The Ollie's books are all hardback) and have been breezing through the series. I can't wait.  Are there comics or a special order in which I can read it to get most out of the series? Right now I'm just going 1-8, but are there some good fillers? Thank you guys. No spoilers, naturally :) ||||| I'd stick with books & look at comics & other bits & pieces after. For now it's all about The Tower, come reap. ||||| Stay away from spoilers. Enjoy the ride. It has the power to change you. Charyou Tree. Come Reap.  ||||| Basically Keyhole was an afterthought. You wanna read 1-4, keyhole, 5-7.   There is a ton of other material that fits in various places within the timeline. It's all worth reading but I'd get the basic 1-7 down first.  ||||| I would suggest reading Salem's Lot and Insomnia, maybe between 4 and 5. ||||| Read all 8 books. Then read them again. Then start with comics and such.

Lurking here taught me how to change my lifestyle in healthy and positive ways, I use the loseit app to track my daily calories. In the past I'd try whatever juice cleanse I found while googling, lose 20 pounds and put it right back on. I was grocery shopping this morning and had flashbacks of a year ago when I would be ringing with sweat just from walking the aisles. Last June I was 300lbs, today I weigh in at 232.4Lbs.

9143	1,3,3,3,3,0,0	25	Three years ago, Joe was a brand new owner; the first big move he made was to trade Monta for Bogut.  [The entire fan base literally booed him out of the arena]([URL]  I was among them.  At the time, I felt that Monta was worth a lot more than a perpetually injured center.  I'm still not entirely sure I was wrong about that, but, when Bogut is healthy, he's definitely a critical piece on this team.    It doesn't really matter.  Every move he's made since then has been the right one.  And now, after decades of mediocre teams, the warriors are among the favorites to win the title.  It's the most fun I've ever had as a warriors fan.  Just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, *thank you*, Joe.  I was wrong about you three years ago, and no one is happier about it than I am.  Hopefully someone on your PR team will see this and let you know.   ||||| My cousin and I attended that game. We didn't boo because we knew we just fleeced the Bucks with that deal. Hell, the game before, I believe in Sac, as we were headed to Arco, we heard the trade on the radio and we're pumped.  But we did duck our heads because we were embarrassed for Lacob.  ||||| i love lacob but myers deserves most of the credit tbh ||||| Definitely Lacob. He's done a good job not just with the product on the floor, but the entire organization as well, including the business side. They didn't win the best organization in sports 2 years running for nothing. And Steph doesn't get the #1 vote for All Star without the organization putting out a tremendous effort to get the people to vote.  ||||| I'm still in daily disbelief over how good we've become in three years, Lacob and Meyers are geniuses in my book. But sometimes I wonder what we'd be like had we never traded Monte. We probably wouldn't be as good, we probably wouldn't have landed Barnes, and all sorts of other things would have turned out differently, but god damn a back court of prime Curry, Klay, and Monta would be a thing to see. ||||| They haven't done shit yet.  Let's get to the WCF before saying anything. ||||| Nice of you too say this about Joe Lacob, but in all *honestly* we still got a lot more games to go. Im not gonna lie, im still a little bitter with how things ended with Mark Jackson. 
5456	1,3,3,3,3,3	8	Has anyone ever been in a situation where an ex friend has bad mouthed you to all of your mutual friends to the point that you have become estranged from an entire group? This happened to me 3 years ago. I know I made mistakes, but so did this other person, but I chose the high road & didn't drag her name through the mud. I choose not to talk about it. I found out that they were all at a party recently & are still speaking badly about me. I have written most of them off & try not to focus on the hurt feelings because that can send me into a downward spiral. But I wonder why they waste their energy on old grudges. Is their hatred of me the glue that holds their friendships together? I know I don't need any of them. I have other friends. But it really hurts to have that much negativity still directed at me after 3 years of trying to just get past it. ||||| Some people are fueled by bringing others down to ignore their own faults/unhappiness. If that is what inspires them to hang out (hating on you) I wouldn't even call those friendships. Glad you don't have them in your life anymore, and hope your new friends are making you happy. =) ||||| Those were never your 'friends', I'm sorry. They sound like sad little people :/ If I were you, I'd pity them. From afar, I mean. You don't need them in your life again. ||||| I agree, I had this happen to me and then there was no where for me to go because they had been my friends for so long. I'm still struggling about it and I don't really know what to do still because no one seems to have an interest in getting to know me that well. Like I have a lot of acquaintances but no friends that I would trust with anything besides 2 people who were around before this all happened. ||||| I have an employee like that. He believes that I did something to him and now holds a grudge against me even though I have talked to him about it. I hate confrontation as much as the next person and I usually let things go if they're not a big deal. I think holding grudges is part of what makes people, people.   Edit: And yeah just move on. Like you said you have other friends. And if they were your real friends they wouldn't hold anything against you.  ||||| I had a group of friends like that a few years ago. I don't think all of them held ill feelings towards me, it was just those few "leaders" which pressured them into running away and isolating me. After some messy friendships and hanging around with the wrong crowd I reconnected with that reformed group and the people who actually cared and respected me once I had matured a bit and was just that little more wiser. I found interesting people who were weird just like me. I don't really hold grudges that much. They're too tiring.

Taking it out of the country doesn't change that. Same with Club Nintendo. It would still work too.
8825	1,3,3	13	I am looking at the requirements online, and it said I must apply in person; but the requirements just state a photo and a form. The online form seems to request a birth certificate; is this a necessity for getting a new passport? I do not have one and I am not in America. It also does not explain how long this would take; could I do it within  a few days?  ||||| If you don't currently have a passport, yes, you would need your birth certificate.  You could get one in a few days, but you must go in person and you must show proof of travel. ||||| I guess it depends on the consulate but it is possible to get a new passport in the same day (within the hour, even) once you have all the documents at hand. I had an emergency situation in Kuala Lumpur a few years back and got it done.   I did not have my passport, btw. I suggest you speak to a consular officer regarding your specific case.

4960	1,3,3,3	4	Hey guise,  So I spend a lot of my time on the road (Usually 2-3 weeks a month, sometimes 1-3 months at a time). As such I don't really get a chance to game much anymore. My backlog of games I need to get through is pretty big, and I've recently started getting back into it with a decent chunk of time "home". However living the nomadic lifestyle means it's a bit tricky to keep it up on the go. I've brought my PS3 along with me sometimes when I knew I was going to stay at a hotel that had an HDTV in the room that you could actually use. (A lot of hotels/casinos totally nerf their HDTVs so all you can do is watch crappy standard-def channels on them. The hell?)   I've been thinking about buying a small HDTV and an ATA case or something similar and essentially bringing that around with me where ever I go since I already live out of the trunk of my car anyswayze. Pretty much I'm wondering if anyone out there does/has done something similar, and what are some things I should be looking into investing in to do this? ||||| Just buy a DS... thousands of games.. good prices... actually portable. ||||| How about doing something like [this]([URL] ||||| Game boy Advance, and a crapload of GBA/GB games.

6837	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	29	Hey all.  I plan on starting a game with the new Old Gods start and playing through to the end date.  My goal is to blob to cover as much of the map as possible and then possibly convert to EU3 or EU4 and challenge the Eastern world.  Are there certain starting kingdoms that would be good to start as?  Any blobbing tips in general?  I'm fairly new to the game but am pretty familiar with the mechanics by now.  I just don't know what "good blobbing strategies" are really.  For those who say blobbing so much may make EU3 or EU4 too easy, I'm okay with that.  It's going to be a rule-the-world roleplay game essentially.  Thank you! ||||| Well for eu3 the main problem is infamy. You lose infamy for releasing vassals. So one of the more expoiltable ways to blob is to release a vassal that you already have all cores on and then cancel the vassalilation at a cost of prestige. You can them rexonquest the country for no infamy gain  ||||| For Old Gods, start as any Norse duke.  Use the become king ambition. Use coastal conquest on the Baltic coast and British isles, then move inland. Use subjugation every 10 years on the largest pagan kingdom or duchy.  Once most or all of the major pagan territories have been vandalized, reform the Norse faith. Start holy warring against western Europe. I'm not sure If reforming changes the marriage penalties (that just may be a normal thing with the new patch), but If possible get some dynastic claims on the remaining kingdoms and empires. Press claims. Repeat. ||||| I give you 100 years before you get bored in EU ||||| >starting a game with the new Old Gods start and **playing** **through** **to** **the** **end** **date.**  Heck, you'll need plenty of luck to do that *alone.*  Joke aside, The traditional Ireland start is generally seen as a good way of learning to blob. Just start as a count and work your way up until you're king. Then, you can just holy war your way to territorial gains, in addition to arranging for other duchies and/or kingdoms to be inherited by your heir.  EU3 does in fact make blobbing incredibly easy. The issue comes from the penalties that arise from blobbing, chiefly from the infamous BB (now called infamy). Infamy rises whenever you take territory from your enemy that is not considered your core province, and unfortunately infamy increases very easily when blobbing, mostly from annexing entire nations. Too much infamy, and the whole bloody world ends up declaring war on you... out of fear. I haven't much experience yet in EU3 to say more, but I believe there are ways of blobbing without accruing infamy. I do know, however, that over-expansion results from having too many territories that are not considered core provinces, and therefore your political and economic efficiency suffers for it.  Good luck in your conquests! Keep us updated. ||||| Your biggest problem is going to be vassal management. Im sadly of little help here.  You can start as the king of France and try to inherit the HRE, while you bring cristianity to heathens.  Good luck ||||| I think starting as the Byzantine Empire is the best way to go.  Use marriages to get as much land as possible, but you should definitely take advantage of the lack of infamy in CK2.  Once you form the Roman Empire and mend the Great Schism things should become a lot easier, since you can then Holy War on Catholics and start re-conquering all your de jure territory.   ||||| >Blobbing in EU3  The key is keeping your infamy low. Only attack if you have good CB, Get the Infamy adviser, Take their territory but don't annex them entirely, expand using Royal Marriages where possible. ||||| I don't have any experience with OG yet, but prior to that, I was able to blob basically the entire map minus Byzantine and HRE as the king of Sweden. It really is as simple as Holy War, shape your marriage claims to make an Empire as quickly as possible, make an antipope, conquer papacy, Holy War the Muslims for every scrap of territory they own, win all the Crusades that get launched, and further leverage marriages to take over as much territory as possible each time you declare war on somebody.  Literally the only reason I can't paint the map is because you can't take over an empire by installing a claimant, even if they're you're vassal and relative. Chipping away at the HRE and Byzantine empires is just too time consuming compared to the massive gains (both geographical and financial) you can make elsewhere for less cost and less long-term risk.  If you get really lucky with marriages, then you can exploit intra-empire conflicts that temporarily release chunks of the two aforementioned empires into kingdoms. But it requires you to dedicate a fair amount of your retinue to "just in case" positioning, because once you declare that war, you need to move *very* quickly to rack up maximum warscore while also making sure that the HRE/Byzantine WS against the same opponent remains very low so that they don't reunite. ||||| When it comes to blobbing in CK2.  Hapsburg that shit up.  Figure out the inheritance laws of countries, marry daughters and kill the other heir.  Just do whatever you can to inherit thrones for your sons (preferably the one in line to inherit your throne).

Kvothe did end up getting a bit of amber:  > On his first hand he wore rings of stone, > Iron, amber, wood, and bone.  I searched a bit and didn't find much speculation, any ideas what powers amber holds? ||||| All we really know is that amber supposedly gives power over demons. I'm going to add that amber from the fae may well be significant. All the references to amber could be related to the references to Faen wood as well, the Leoclos box, Devi's strange smelling room and the Ctaeths tree. Essentially Fae trees are "magic" and their sap is magic too, maybe. ||||| From reading a number of crystal related websites, Amber (when worn) typically provides the bearer with protection against any type of negativity, especially from psychic attack.   Oh, and it also has an electromagnetic quality, i.e. it will build up an electrical charge. Perhaps it could also be a source of energy for sympathy? Though I doubt it would hold enough of a charge to be very useful (unless enhanced).  Hopefully that helps a bit. ||||| Also, Wil, Sim, and Kvothe are walking home from the Eolian drunk.  During their banter, Wil says that he wishes he had a ring of amber that allows him to control demons. It might have been during the same conversation that they discuss "If you could go anywhere, where would you go?" and Wil says that he would go to the Faen Courts.   ||||| Could it be the [Spoiler](/s "ring that Auri has down in the Underthing? She even thinks about giving it to Kvothe when she thought that he was early, but then decides not to because there's no reason that she can think of that he would need to control demons.")  EDIT: I'm only half way through A Slow Regard For Silent Things, don't kill me if she does something else with it. ||||| Well, he wears a wooden ring because he's ruh and wants to spite his aunt, the bone one is from stapes, iron... The Maer? But he returned it so maybe he learns the name of iron. Amber could be for the wind, or something to do with lighting. It's associated with him strongly already, so he could learn the name in b3.  I wouldn't be surprised if the rings aren't actually to do with naming at all and he just happens to collect them during his adventures. 
2935	1,3,3,2,3,0	7	 So this is a project I'm very excited about.   I'm sure a lot of you have already heard about RISUG in India.   It's a male birth control that's supposedly extremely effective, and very reversible.  Well they're doing studies now to bring it live in the US.  They just finished their rabbit studies (it's super effective!) and they're moving on to studying reversal and then a monkey study.     They're an awesome group, and they're crowdfunding the research to try to keep big pharma out of the works (so they don't have to jack up the prices).   Anyway, they have a target on-the-shelf date of 2015.  I'm a little skeptical because of how slowly the FDA / clinical trials can be, but regardless I'm excited.    They are also now accepting donations!  So if you do donations for science, or just cause you think it's awesome - please donate and help this project to move along!   Check them out, and consider giving them some dough - even a few bucks goes a long way in crowdfunding.  [URL] ||||| This is awesome! I learned about RISUG a few months ago. My boyfriend said that he'll do it as soon as it comes out in the US. :P ||||| Oh, yes! I'm also very happy for this. I just received their update which I subscribed to the first time I read on Vasalgel/ RISUG on reddit. I will be making my small donation to help the funding on this wonderful birthcontrol method. Here is the update available to anyone:    Success! Twelve Rabbits,   Six Months, No Sperm   Yesterday the 12th of 12 rabbits marked six months with Vasalgel™, the long-acting non-hormonal male contraceptive -- with no sperm at all since the second semen sampling!      We were nervous about this study, because it's crucial in determining whether the technology transfer from India went right. Does the new version of the gel (Vasalgel™) work as well as RISUG® in India? Did we successfully adapt the technology for production on a larger scale? It looks like we pulled it off -- so we're breathing a sigh of relief!   Next Steps   Some of the rabbits will now have the Vasalgel reversed by flushing it out with another injection; we're looking into adoption for them for afterwards. (We also require animal housing to meet the much stricter and more humane new European standards; for more information on why the European standards are better than the U.S. ones and what we're doing to try to create change within the system, see the FAQ section: [URL] .)      At the same time there's a flurry of planning: Our small team is choosing manufacturing sites, figuring out final issues around syringe filling and sterilization, looking for a facility that can do a monkey study to our housing standards and within budget, preparing to talk with the FDA, and more.   Timeline to Clinical Trials   We are still aiming to start the first clinical trial by the end of this year, and to have Vasalgel to market by the end of 2015. (It'll be tight -- that's less than 3 years!) Some milestones:          Starting monkey study, and talking to FDA:       Next couple months       Crowdfunding: late spring (probably May)       Knowing more about clinical trial eligibility:       Summer or fall       Starting first small clinical trial (about 50 people):       End of year       Reversibility study and second, larger clinical trial:       Next year    Note: The first clinical trials are likely to be only open to men who are finished having children, since the reversibility studies haven't been done yet. (So far reversibility has only been studied in animals and a handful of men with RISUG® in India-- we're just starting reversibility studies of Vasalgel™.) Realistically, for most men it's going to be at least 2-3 years before Vasalgel™ is an option. Getting frustrated with current methods? Check out the Male Contraception Information Project's page about least-bad current options while you wait.   Finally: A Way to Support Development   People have been asking -- and demanding! -- to contribute for a while now.  But we didn't want to take contributions until we were sure we were on the right track. Well, now we're pretty darn sure!    Parsemus Foundation (the nonprofit foundation developing Vasalgel) has set up Vasalgel as a "social venture," so that the contraceptive will be affordable rather than at big-pharma prices. But that means we don't have big-pharma resources! Here are some of the bills coming up we are raising money for:          Reversal branch of the rabbit study: $10,000 - $12,000       Production and manufacturing: ~$120,000       Toxicology (safety) studies:  $110,000 - $150,000       Monkey effectiveness study: ~$120,000       Initial human study, about 50 men: $150,000 - $250,000       Pivotal human trial: $500,000 to multi-million, depending on the number of sites and the number of men who get to take part      We'll be relying on public support to get this to market. Will you help us get to the next step, clinical trials?      Paypal Secure Donations   [URL] ||||| Why don't you cross post this, or get some more visibility in another subreddit?

3051	1,3,3,3,2,3,2,3,3	13	So I got this crazy idea while reading all the talk on benefits of eccentric exercises. I've hit somewhat of a stale period in workout growth and I'm looking to incorporate something new into my routine. I'm basically planning on pretending that I'm hugely overweight by adding on a weight vest of 90 pounds. I doubt I'll be able to do any pull ups or push ups with it on but I intend to focus heavily on negatives until I can achieve full ROM reps. My stats below   Weight: 190  Height: 5' 6  Age: 28  Max pullups (full ROM, no weight): 11  Max pushups (full ROM, no weight): 40   Anyways, I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on the subject. Also, if someone could answer the following before I start, I would greatly appreciate it.    What are the negative (heh...) consequences to doing a program like this? (higher risk of injury, unbalanced workouts, etc)  Are there any obvious benefits/drawbacks to training like this as opposed to traditional set/reps programs? (X% of max reps for Y sets, 6-12 for strength gains, etc)?    Before people start with the nay saying, I want to point out that I'm not suggesting or advocating this program over traditional body weight programs. Nor am I saying this is better/worse than other programs. This is more of an experiment on new methods of training. Thanks in advance. ||||| I've trained with weighted vests and I thought I should point out that you shouldn't start off with 90lbs unless you want to risk injuring tendons especially with weighted pullups. ||||| I would start lower and work your way up but I say go for it. Ive been training the same thing for a couple weeks now and its been going well for me. ||||| Interesting question. I have wondered the same myself, so I hope we get some good answers here.  That said, you might find this post useful:  [URL]  Also, I believe I have heard their is a greater chance of overtraining or injury with eccentrics, but I cannot source that.   Edit:  [URL] ||||| Why start with a 90-lb vest? Couldn't you do progressive increases in weight by loading the vest with smaller weights and then gradually increasing the total load? Or is the vest fixed-weight? ||||| I would still do both concentric and eccentric, but develop a way to add weight to the eccentric without stopping. ||||| Why not just do one arm eccentrics? Save money and time lugging around 90lbs. ||||| Weighted eccentric is a good way to progress if you can do it in a controlled manner, or you can do eccentric one arms with a rope/towel as support.   For source, Google eccentric tendon strengthening. If you're here asking for source you're not using internet as intended. Educate yourself. Anything that will strengthen tendons has a high possibility to damage them if overloaded. Let the downgrade commence  edit: take care to not bust your elbows.  ||||| Bit late here but eccentrics are great for breaking plateaus in my opinion. I wouldn't do them a lot though because it's easier to burn out and get injured on them.  A couple of heavy ones before workout sets can also be a workout potentiator getting the fast twich fibers active.
7780	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	14	So, first off I should probably say I'm only 17, so I'm definitely not the most experienced in this department. However, I have been with two different girls and they said the same things.  Basically when I am fingering a girl I am a pro at it (is that a thing?) I made my most recent ex cum three times in ~15 minutes. But when we actually have sex they say it isn't nearly as satisfying.   I'm writing it off as inexperience right now but I just wanted to make sure I'm not failing at this stuff. :( ||||| You all are my new best friends :') ||||| I wouldn't worry about it. I can do things to my gf with my fingers that no cock can do. She cums way harder with finger than cock, and I can give her endless orgasms. My fingers don't go flaccid, and I can massage her A and G spots with precision and control. I'm just happy to be able to make her feel that good. ||||| Not sure if this goes for all girls or just me, but when I first starting having sex foreplay was definitely more enjoyable than actual sex. Sometimes sex was painful or uncomfortable for me. As time went on sex became more satisfying. It may just be that the girls you are having sex with are less "experienced". It's probably them, not you. Hope this helps :) ||||| I often cum from fingering, but not PIV.  Fingers can move much faster. ||||| She may have a natural preference for that kind of stimulation. Most girls can't cum from penetration alone so I wouldn't worry too much, especially since you'll get better at that over time :) Why not combine the two and touch her clit while you're penetrating her? ||||| PV insertion isn't that great for some people. And fingers can curl, twitch, tickle- whatever.  A penis can only thrust so much.  But fingers.   Man. Fingering can be awesome if you're good at it. Consider it a compliment. Practice sexual techniques and hey- it might be your positions too. ||||| You shouldn't be upset. Making PIV more pleasurable than fingering can take a lot of time, depending on the woman, and it might very well be that a woman will always find fingering way more pleasurable than PIV sex. ||||| I'm the same way, me and my dick are besties, but I probably couldn't make a woman cum without my fingers. When I was your age it would bum me out, but now I don't sweat it.   Really it just makes sense:  1) Clit stimulation can be a big deal for a lot of women. It's not impossible to do during piv, but you can rarely put the same focus on it as you can when you're just fingering.   2) fingers have muscles, joints and tendons, so you can bend and twist them into all kinds of crazy shapes to hit her spots and drive her crazy. With your dick you can adjust your angle and your depth and then that's about it.   3) with your fingers you have way more control over how much force you apply (or don't apply) than you ever will with your dick  4) fingers can't cum. keep up with your bicep curls and you should be able to finger for days without stopping.   5) [somewhat controversial] when it comes to PIV sex, size matters. My dick is on the lower side of average in terms of length and girth, so I may not be able to hit all the spots for some gals, or give them an overwhelming sensation. My fingers allow me to really *fuck* a girl, and punish her in a way I just can't with my D.   Hope this helps.  ||||| As long as it makes them come back for more, why be upset? ||||| Dude, if you're good at something, do it.  Just don't neglect to work on the other things too.  There's no shame at being better at one thing than another, and you can always practice, practice, practice. ||||| Fingers can control the angle and pressure better.  A dick can make them feel more full, and while that is nice it wont always hit the right spots.  I always find if you get her off gspot wise from fingers first, they will usually be so sensitive after they can get off that way from sex right after that.  Most girls dont cum from piv at all, so dont let that get to you... ||||| Fingers are the only thing that do it best for me. That's just how I'm built. DON'T FEEL BAD! It's a good thing you are concerned, but it doesn't mean your penis-sex is lacking. Some girls just do best with hands :)

I'm not even asking him to consider radical things, these are things quite obvious . He simply wont hear it. ||||| The relationship the U.S. government and the church has historically tends to gel people within the church. The government will say something is wrong with the practice Mormons do and the persecuted people believe that the persecution is a result of their righteousness (i.e. polygamy and taking over Missouri). I think there is a hint of that today. Some members of the church need what they perceive as persecution to justify their belief. If they aren't being persecuted then are they really doing the right? Opposition in all things was something I heard from this past conference. Because of the need to fight back I think it blinds people to critically analyzing what they really are fighting for or about. Plus many members live in a bubble and have no idea what its like other places.  ||||| My favorite are my FB friends that bitterly complain about something that the government does but their heads are so far up their asses they can't see that the church does it as well. ||||| So true, so true. ||||| I think this goes for Americans with religion in general  ||||| Special pleading ftw!

178	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	37	[deleted] ||||| I enjoyed my engineering education from day one. Sure, some classes were frustrating: The professors didn't explain things clearly, the math was a meaningless mess of symbols you had to juggle... but at the end of each chapter, you should be able to look back and say "Wow, I can now do some math and predict exactly how... this wing will flutter as a function of how thick the structure is, how this current will spike as a function of what goes past the sensor, how this engine's emissions will change as a function of the fuel-air mixture and the valve timing, how this rocket engine will produce more or less thrust over more or less time as a function of the area of the channels in the fuel grain, how much fan power this computer chip needs to stay cool as a function of how much processing it's doing, how tight this car can turn before it skids, how big a rocket has to be in order to put this payload into this orbit, how fast this jet can go before the turbine blades melt, how hot things will get along the leading edges of this re-entering space capsule..."  This is really powerful stuff! You can look at almost any physical thing in the world and do some back-of-the envelope calculations and come up with masses, sizes, forces, temperatures, and distances! That’s like a superpower.  I think you should be able to keep a big-picture image in your head. You should look at the machines out in the world and ask yourself what advances are being made in their technologies, what compromises their designers have to struggle with, why machines optimized for different missions (a dragster versus a LeMans racer, a pair of headphones versus the huge speakers at a rock concert, an iPhone versus a server rack, an office building versus a stadium, a 787 versus an F-22 versus a Pitts) look different, why certain designs from fiction aren't practical, etc. You should pay attention to all the machines around you all the time, you have to ask yourself "Why?" . That way, the equations you learn in class are an answer to a pre-existing question, rather than a whole new thing you have to learn from scratch. You should be able to imagine enough machines, know enough (or guess enough) about their mechanisms and limitations and about the physical phenomena they exploit, so that when you learn something in class, it fills a gap in your map of knowledge, so that your homework assignments are not the first time that you contemplate what determines this or that design feature, so that your homework is just the first time you *quantify* the question.  This makes learning easier, more fun, and more useful.  Ok, I confess I have spent almost no time thinking about how buildings or electronics have changed over time, or about the compromises that must be made by their designers. But I have always loved airplanes. LOVED airplanes. Since I first could read, I have read everything I could find about airplanes. When I learned that, as things fall/slide up and down, ½mv²=mgh (in like 9th grade), this revealed to me why airplanes need to be able to be going a certain speed, and/or turn in a tight-enough circle, in order to be able to do a loop. When I learned that x=vt+½at² (I think in 10th grade), I realized why, when you come in to land just 20% faster or take off just 20% heavier, you need like 50% more runway. When I learned about moments (around 11th grade), I understood why ailerons are out by the wingtips and why the stabilizers and elevators and rudder are as far back as possible. When I learned about circular motion (around 12th grade), I understood why a slower airplane can turn much faster (in terms of degrees per second) without having to pull too many Gs. When I learned about the Brayton Cycle and the Otto Cycle (freshman year of college), I understood why the efficiency of a jet engine relies so heavily on how much the compressor can raise the pressure of the air (and the same for the efficiency of piston engines and their compression ratio). When I learned about PID control systems (sophomore year), I understood about why it's so hard to avoid [pilot-induced oscillations]([URL] the need for yaw dampers, why [Dutch rolls]([URL] happen, etc. When I learned about resonance (senior year), I understood [flutter]([URL] (These were all things that I had wondered about for years). And by that point I was also learning things where the classes themselves included plenty of aeronautical examples: Bernoulli's equation, labs involving jet engines, working in a wind tunnel, etc.  So if you're passionate and knowledgeable and *curious* about some kind of machine or building or software, then most classes should reveal something that feels enlightening about your area of interest.  And like I said, the math can be frustrating. That's fine. We’re not mathematicians. A lot of times, an analysis method will have so many parameters, so many operations, and so many variables seemingly invented just so the operations can be performed, that you’ll get lost in the math. Like I said, at one point you will no longer have intuition about what behavior the symbols model, and about what changes in their values tell you about the real-life system. But push through. Learn how to do the math, solve the equation, and look back and interpret what the result reveals about the system. Now do another example, using some slightly different initial parameters. Start asking yourself what combinations of numbers would cause some equation to fall apart (i.e. to force you to divide by zero, to end up with a triviality like 0=0, etc), and what situations give you those combinations of numbers. Eventually you’ll be able to bridge your intuition through the entire mathematical mess, to have each step *mean* something, to no longer see a difference between “This equation has two solutions” and “There are two stable configurations for this mechanism with these settings: The one where it points up and the one where it points straight ahead”.  Wow, I wrote a huge book here. Procrastinating from doing a homework where I have to write about a functional. Do you know what a functional is? Yeah, I don't either. But in a couple of days, I will. See, that's another important trick: Just before your class is about to start a new topic, start out by reading the problems at the end of the chapter in the book. Realize that, intuitively, each question has a unique solution, which depends on some parameters that you can probably guess, but you don't know how to calculate the answer yet, even if you knew all the parameters. That will motivate you to pay attention to the lectures, and to want to learn the analysis methods being taught. The professor will say something and you'll think "Oh, so THIS is how I can figure out how much that lump of material is going to deflect!"  What I wrote so far may have been harsh or gloomy. So now on to the positive part.  Being an engineer kicks ass.  Any company that hires engineers is developing something that does not exist yet. You will design or analyze or test something that will become a product that people use. If people do actually end up using your thing, then that's because your thing is better than any other thing like it, whether it's because your thing is cheaper, more reliable, more available, faster, stronger, more efficient, cooler-looking, or easier to use. Your thing will be the best in the world! (Otherwise you would not be paid to work on it).  You will be surrounded by people who have been immersed in your field for decades. They will have intuition about what works and what doesn't work. At first that intuition will seem like magic, but as you work more products and hear more stories, you'll find yourself being able to make these seemingly psychic predictions like your coworkers can: "Yeah, that's not gonna work". As soon as you start your new job, you'll be faced with an absolutely real problem, and an experienced engineer will sit down next to you and show you how to deal with it. (Kinda like classes in college, but simpler and more immediately useful and probably not as mathematically rigirous). You will watch your skills grow and be increasingly proud of your work.  You may get to play with cool toys. You may have a lab where you push things to the brink of failure, and (if you're lucky) then some. You will watch the predictions of your models come to life in the real world, you will see things use the amount of energy you said they would, deliver the force you said they would at the time when you said they would, and break at the point you said they would. All while surrounded by extremely expensive computers and sensors, powerful generators and actuators, screens full of numbers, maybe a high-speed camera.  You may go out into the field. An airplane, or a bridge, or a car, or a power station, may be doing something unexpected, and it might be because of your product. As soon as you see your product's physical environment, the understanding will hit you like a bolt of lightning: My models never took into account the fact that my product is exposed to this material, loaded this way, heated and cooled so quickly, or slammed into by this other thing. Ok, NOW what do you do?  Most importantly: You will go out into the world, be it as part of your job or just as a normal person who travels and sees interesting sights, and appreciate so much more about everything. It'll be like Neo seeing code in the Matrix. You will look up at the truss that supports the roof of your sports stadium, see the flaps deploy as your airplane comes in to land, watch a piece of software spit out an error, hear a funny noise in your car, take a ride in a boat or train, even just look at how your computer case is put together... and you'll go: "Oh. That's interesting. I can see what they were thinking".  So hang in there. It'll be worth it. ||||| As for myself? I work next door to [the biggest building in the world by volume]([URL] I walk through it and see some of the largest and most complex machines ever created by our species [be put together]([URL] like they're Ikea furniture. I have been inside huge rooms when we [ripped apart some structure]([URL] that was able to support tens of tons before it snapped. When it snapped, it was like a cannon had gone off - at just a few percent over the load predicted by my models, using modeling techniques taught to me by [the previous generation of engineers]([URL] I have walked around and through the world's most modern airplane structure as it was strapped to [a torture machine built to test its durability]([URL] - or, rather, to test the accuracy of the durability-prediction models that my coworkers came up with. I have gotten to crawl around airplanes in the field and look at structural aging phenomena, so that I could come back to my desk and see if I could simulate it on the computer. I have designed, and watched, and crunched the data for, hundreds and hundreds of tests where we broke a small component in the lab, so that I could refine the equations that will tell you when and how something will break as a function of its shape and materials (especially when using new shapes and materials), including the impact of manufacturing flaws. I have been in touch with airlines and airplane mechanics to tell them how to do better maintenance, and now I teach engineers how to figure out how an airline or mechanic can do better maintenance. I am part of the group that figure out why [this]([URL] and [this]([URL] and [this]([URL] happened, and designed and ran tests to validate our hypotheses. Some of the older people in my group figured out why [this]([URL] and [this]([URL] and [this]([URL] happened.

I was only here for the tail end of that project, but you know what they say, that last 20% of the project takes 80% of the work. ||||| Civil here.  A year ago I managed a project that removed a 100 year old steel railroad bridge and moved in a new steel span with less then 12 hours from last train on the old bridge to first train on the new.  Each span weighed approx 1 million pounds.  ||||| It does. School will get better. Then your first job will likely suck. Then after paying your dues and getting noticed...then you start to get some really interesting assignments...play with big expensive toys, lead large teams of experts, make something that's never been made before, etc. ||||| Stick with it, bud.  I just finished my undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering last spring and have begun work as an applied research engineer with a medical device company designing cardiac pacemakers and cardio defibs.  I've had the chance to take part in a number of implantation procedures on swine models to observe behavior of a next-generation pacemaker design.    It's tough to see the merit in much of what you learn.  Granted, the vast majority of it will never be seen or used again in your day-to-day.  But remember - engineering is a very big place.  You don't know what you'll be called on to learn and so it helps having as broad of a background as you can possibly have.  Cheer up!  First two years suck for EVERYONE.  We all got through it; you will too.  ||||| My first job (out of grad school) was with a large company working on military electronic warfare (GPS jamming, anti-jamming, spoofing, etc.).  I had a top secret security clearance and frequently found myself on military bases doing testing with lots of toys.  We did testing in the back of a van that reminded me a lot of those FBI surveillance vans that you see in movies.  One whole wall of the van was filled with electronic equipment.  The most interesting testing I ever did was done in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere (literally) because we were jamming GPS signals and we didn't want to/weren't allowed to interfere with any overhead air traffic.    When I wasn't out testing things I was in the office/lab working with half million dollar equipment that our team built ourselves and that didn't exist anywhere else in the world.   ||||| If you go work for a large company (speaking electrical engineering here) right out of college, you'll actually get exposed to lots of very nice toys and get to use them a ton.  Even as a co-op, I've gotten to play with $250,000 (40GSps) oscilloscopes, a $35,000 PCIe bus analyzer, and some intensely dense prototype hardware. 22-layer boards are a bitch to analyze.  You'll also have to do TONS of paperwork (especially if you're working on a government project), but that's inevitable with nearly every job in existence. It gets fun, you'll most likely get a very well-paying job (like talking $55k+ per year right out of college), and you'll make a good presence in no-time. ||||| EE here with a focus on software. I've been out of school for about eleven years.  Lots of cool stuff!   * The classes do get much more interesting, btw. The labs in your fourth are especially good. You start to feel like a "real" engineer. * I got to travel a lot for both my co-ops and my full time jobs, including work in Mexico, Canada, and lots of places all over the U.S. * I worked behind the scenes at several airports designing their baggage screening systems. That also meant working with the TSA, which was interesting. * I mostly worked in industrial automation in the automotive industry, but I once had a four month project at a Pillsbury plant. It was neat to dress in a lab coat and hairnet and smell sugar and cookie dough while I was programming. Plus they gave us free products every week for increasing productivity. * I've attended a lot of trade shows. Typically vendors will load you up with free meals and other stuff to get you to keep buying their stuff for your projects. * But overall, it's been very interesting to just get in and see how things work. And it's even cooler when you figure how to make it better.  Stick with it. We always need more engineers. ||||| I'm not going to lie. I loved majoring in EE from the very start. ||||| [stuff I did a while ago]([URL] I now use this awesome material under my PS3 to avoid the vibrations going into the wooden cabinet. Works amazingly well. ||||| Civil by degree, but I'm working at a shipyard building drillships. Everything is on a massive scale - crankshafts the size of tractor trailers, BOPs with snips that can slice through solid steel, propellers the size of small houses, and winches than can hold hundreds of thousands of pounds. I get to play in the driller's cabin with Star Wars-style cockpits and use 150 mm wrenches on massive holding tanks.  It gets interesting. And if you don't like engineering, you can use your degree in banking, business, research, education, pretty much anywhere. ||||| Every now and again I get to go out in the field and oversee convoy or road closing operations. I always find this stuff exciting.  Also, road-side accident investigation. ||||| School may be tedious, but it does get more interesting as you advance.  As far as cool things in my job...I love what I do, so everything seems cool.  I get to help major companies design materials for their next-generation products.  This includes phone bodies and cases, high density plastics for golf club weights, and high-tech things like neutrally buoyant cable jacketing for underwater rovers.  Every day I find new projects to work on and each one presents its own challenges and obstacles.  The fun part is solving those problems.  ||||| I am currently working on integrating fluid dynamics and structural dynamics codes to predict the onset of flutter instability.  I get to use monster computers everyday which take up whole rooms and get to make really cool videos like [this!]([URL]  I really love my work. ||||| I have a job thats only 40 hours a week and pays me enough to live in Hawaii.  Comfortably.  It gets better when you get to pick your courses, I promise. ||||| I felt the same way and switched to a science rather than stay in engineering.  I enjoyed it way more and get paid the same as a civil engineer. ||||| I have to echo what nearly everyone else here has said. School will probably suck for the first little while. I know I really only started to get really interested in my classes when I got to third and fourth year (with the odd few in second year that were focused on my degree). I had a blast with my third and fourth year classes though. In third year when my classes started to focus on my degree, things got much more interesting and I got to do several really interesting projects including my senior design project where I helped redesign a data processing system for a local engineering company. School will be tough but it will get more interesting and it will be **so** worth it when you're done.  Currently I work for a university and maintain their data network. This includes working on various projects such as a wireless infrastructure upgrade, troubleshooting interesting problems, and maintaining their network day-to-day. I really enjoy what I do every day. ||||| Redesigned the lane markings when they repaved the road outside the local high school. They now have two miles of bike lanes they didn't have before.  First year of engineering sucks. My buddy used to call it "liberal engineering." Hang in there.

3108	1,0,3,3,3	6	**Investing in the units of tomorrow today- 6* review reeze tier**  * Vishura(6**)   Leader Skill: Chance of inflicting a random status effect and increase to crit damage   BB: Multiple target, 11-hit combo that has a chance of inflicting curse   SBB: Multiple target, 13-hit combo that gives a chance of increasing BB gauge when taking damage for 3 turns   Stats at 6* (Lord): 5900/1999/1823/1500   -Disappointing percentage on that leader skill boosting crit by a mere 50% meaning that he cannot take over from zebra as the crit leader with gd stats.   -interesting sbb effect but high fill requirements means that it is nothing amazing(unless boss with 10 hits a turn comes out in the future)   -Overall impressive stats however the lacking leader skill and situational sbb effect puts him as a tier 3 unit     * Reeze(6**)   Leader Skill: Prevents abnormal status effects and gives a small chance of increasing BB gauge when taking damage.   BB: Multiple target, 11-hit combo that has a chance of causing paralysis   SBB: Multiple target, 14-hit combo that increases Reeze's atk, def, and rec.   Stats at 6* (Lord): 6404/1905/1601/1522 (10 hit count)   -Look at that health, wtf 7.19k with anima typing without sphere. That is insane.   -Selfish sbb effect makes her?/him? less viable as he/she does not offer anything extra to the team.   - Interesting leader skill but bc generation seems low at around 1.5 bc per enemy attack(not hit count, attacks). Overall his leader skill is lacking unless you do not own elsiel.   -All in all, meh, better than twins but far worst then elsiel putting it firming in the middle of the pack of tier 3.    * Dilma(6**)    Leader Skill: Increase to BB gauge each turn and increase in spark damage   BB: Multiple target, 2-hit combo that ignores enemy defense for 2 turns   SBB: Multiple target, 2-hit combo that ignores enemy defense for 2 turns and fully heals Dilma's HP for 3 turns   Stats at 6* (Lord): 6000/2203/1481/2000(4 hit count)   -Boosting insane stats and the lowest bb refill requirement for defense ignore and a massive multiplier (higher than lilitth sbb and logan sbb) to his sbb,  Dilma is definitely a powerhouse.   -However bogged down by his 4 hit count and 2 hit sbb, his ability to generate bc is gimped especially in this bb focused meta. Moreover people overvalue his sbb’s heal which while powerful is inherently selfish and even if he survives, he does little if his team dies.   -Overall Dilma’s 6 form is pretty impressive but critical flaws in hit count and selfish buffs puts him in down to tier 2.    * Rashil (6**)   Leader Skill: Increase to BB gauge each turn. More BC are generated during spark   BB: Restores HP and increases chance of critical hit for 3 turns   SBB: Restores HP, increases chance of critical hit for 3 turns, and angel idol buff to self.    Stats at 6* (Lord): 5721/1522/1868/1983   Hit Count: 7   -Extremely gd stats for a healer. Angel idol buff sorta relevant to prevent him from dying when he heals.   -While his bb effects are extremely random and does not seem to synergies well unlike elimo, he does not have much competition. Other premium healers like lancia and world tree are just outclassed heavily in the stats department. Themis and tillith are outclassed as rashil at least provides some utility as compared to next to non that themis and tilitth provides. Thus he is the second best healer after elimo(pretty far behind though).   -On a side note should alim decide to make a sphere that says (All enemies must attack this unit). Rashill might be insanely op overnight with his cannot be killed sbb.    * Lilith (6**)   Leader Skill: 65% atk boost to rainbow team. (5 units who are different in element)   BB: Single target, 15-hit combo   SBB: Single target, 16-hit combo that fully restores Lilith's BB gauge   Stats at 6* (Lord): 6005/1823/1792/1649   Hit Count: 9   -That sbb. What is there to say but she is probably the strongest units to have vs single target bosses. With great stats and pure dmg what’s not to like.   -Outside of single target boss fights her application are limited due to lack of utility and aoe. Making her less than ideal for FH and such. Tier 1 vs single boss. Tier 3(low) for others.    * Logan (6**)   Leader Skill: 65% atk boost to rainbow team. (5 units who are different in element)   BB: Single target, 13-hit combo. Absorbs target's HP.   SBB: Multiple target, 16-hit combo. For 3 turns Logan's atk is increased by 300% at the cost of losing 50% def   Stats at 6* (Lord): 5844/2100/1774/1471   Hit Count: 9   -O how to mighty have fallen. Alim continues their tradition of nerfing loved units and buffing overlooked ones. At first glance it seems ok with amazing stats. However on a closer look we see the most impractical sbb in the game. While the multiplier is high and fill rate low, the lost in defense makes him unusable in raid battles and hard boss fights. It’s a mere winmore – useless when you are losing, useful only if you are winning by a large margin and its only to save time.   -other than that there’s nothing to say unlike faron he has no niche in arena leaving him to be probably one of the weakest 6* with no place where he can serve well. Tier 4.   ~~**Are we at the edge of Anima frontier’s heydays?**~~   ~~Most current players will agree that for the most part, anima is the best type for most units in BF. However I think we will soon have to face the notion that anima would be the worst type to pull for future units, maybe even current ones.~~    ~~With the rise of 25% legwend sphere, grah, tesla and stats imp it is likely anime units are hitting the hard cap. The maximum value of 9999 hp usually an unattainable goal now stands possible. With 2 grah leader and legwend sphere equipped, we would be hitting the 9999hp cap with merely 6060 base hp or 5560 base hp before hp imps. Most anima units that we claim are the best easily go pass this limit and any hp stats after is clearly wasted stats. If grah get a 6* or if the elusive 30% sphere becomes commonplace (maybe in 6 more months?) we could easily be calling oracle the best type and anima the worst 6 month in the future.~~    ~~Some notable numbers: Assuming 6* grah is 30% stats 2x5*grah + legwend (5560 before hp imp). 2x5* grah+ 30% sphere(5381 before hp imp) 2x6*grah with legwend(4904 before hp imp) and lastly 2x6* grah with 30% sphere(4762 before hp imp)~~  thx cyhlalala dam i thought it had a cap.   **VP exclusive spheres and how they may impact our meta.**    Truth is most people think they suck and I agree. Golden aegis and silver aegis while nice are extremely outclassed by medulla, legwend, 30% spheres and even legend vortex sphere. However I believe that blood scythe is far more useful than the aegis series. The aegis series are without a doubt stats spheres and thus cannot stack with medulla and the likes. However blood scythe is not a stats sphere and thus can be used to stack with another stats sphere. Secondary sphere has far less competition and the reliable lifesteal from blood scythe makes it a somewhat desirable sphere for some situation. Imagine 6* Lilith with legwend and blood scythe. Perma SBB with heals and great stats. ||||| Pretty sure HP can go [over 10k]([URL] And regarding Logan, I **believe** the SBB is still ok if you use an angel idol coupled with a tesla, who would be used a lot in raids anyway. Anyway, appreciate the write-up, some interesting views there!  EDIT: skip to 3.02 if you don't want to watch the whole video in that link ||||| 6 months down the line with JP Frontier, I predict that Guardian typing will be best since, as you stated the 25% stat boosting spheres and eventual powercreep of future units boosting stats will be more beneficial to boosting HP than Anima. ||||| This is interesting to see Logan's SBB being called bad. In another thread, everyone was praising a new fire unit for the exact same skill.   Still pumped for these units, min/maxing be damned.  ||||| Nice writeup, thanks for this, interesting view on anima typing !
9482	1,3,3	3	[deleted] ||||| I would like to preface this by saying I'm not an expert. This is just what I got out of my reading.  The Impossible is the traumatic aspect of the real (small r) which is focused in the *objet petit a*, the central symbolic gap of desire transforming the real to the Real of an ideology. It is the radiating middle which can never be approached without utterly destroying the symbolic universe (hence its Impossibility).   The Master-Signifier is the in-itself signifier, the ultimate point at which any further push into the symbolic order becomes semantic. It too is a radiating middle of the symbolic universe, because asking what the Master-Signifier signifies is Impossible, because (as you're asking) the symbolic universe is constructed around it.  The difference is that the Master-Signifier in a way stands in for the subject whereas the *objet petit a* is an object of desire, but both of them are encounters with the Impossible glue which unites the symbolic order through an ontological gap. ||||| The failure to know the world is not (only) a question of a split between the subject and the world or of a split within the subject. The world itself is split and divided.   Something exists because nothing fails to be nothing. Then there is an irreducible multiplicity. This multiplicity cannot be reduced by positing a totality or by positing discrete objects/subjects, i.e there is no big one (the all-that-is) or little one (discrete beings).   Object a is the lack shared by all (supposedly) discrete subjects/objects, the lack within the other which mirrors my own lack.   The master signifier is the chosen signifier of the irreducible antagonism of (ultimately physical) reality, experienced as our subjective existential and social antagonisms.   directly answering your questions: 1) object a directly is the impossibility of the subject. A good example by Zizek is that instead of desiring the other despite its flaws, they are actually the cause of our desire. The lack within the other is desirable because in it we see reflected back to us our own incoherence.  2) the master signifier creates social order by providing a cognitive mapping for our situation. It postulates a cause of the antagonism we experience, and can meaningfully harmonize social life around this understanding. The master signifier ultimately fails to manage this situation as the cognitive mapping it provides because less and less plausible. No master signifier is able to escape this fate because there is no discursive formulation possible to explain the radical antagonism constitutive of being.

6597	1,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,2,3,0,0	16	[empty] ||||| Way to sensationalize the title, jackass.  According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, there were 643,067 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons nationwide as of January 2009. Additionally, about 1.56 million people used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program during the 12-month period between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009. This number suggests that roughly 1 in every 200 persons in the US used the shelter system at some point in that period.  312 million people divided by 200 = 1,560,000 homeless.  Walmart's efforts will be $1282, if we make the mistake of assuming zero overhead costs, distribution costs, and assuming that every single person will somehow get equal food as the next homeless person.  Either way, $1280 is $106 a month, which means that walmart has made a humongous and generous contribution here.  Dumbass. ||||| Editorialized title ||||| [empty] ||||| I guess that's cheaper than actually paying their employees a fair wage, so they wouldn't be relying on food stamps.  Seriously, fuck Wal-Mart.  [URL] ||||| To be fair, you could get a shit load of food for six bucks from Walmart. ||||| In other news, Walmart attempts to drown out negative press about their recent union-busting efforts in California by pretending they care about hunger in America.  Edit: If they really cared about hunger in America, they'd pay a decent wage and quit gaming the system to avoid providing employee benefits for the majority of their workers.  Far too many Walmart employees number among the "hungry in America", drawing food stamps and other aid just to get by.  Also, as I note elsewhere, it appears the majority of this charitable contribution is the expired foodstuffs from their store shelves which they'd have to write off as a loss anyway, being touted around at its full retail value for the sake of good press.  While donating it to food banks rather than throwing it out is a wonderful thing, you can't give it the same weight as you would a commitment to donate $2 billion to charity from the company coffers; the bulk of this act of charity won't be affecting the company's bottom line whatsoever.  It's a low opportunity cost gesture with a high return in good PR, and I sincerely doubt it's an accident they've done this hot on the heels of the recent bad national press surrounding the distribution center strike. ||||| So they're feeding all of their employees? ||||| So, they're giving everyone a bag of chips and a jar of queso from Frito Lays? ||||| Why don't they pledge to pay people fair wages and provide them a fair shot at some fucking benefits? I don't shop at Walmart and I most certainly would never work at one but Walmart definitely doesn't do Americans any favors and their treatment of employees is well established.   This is more bullshit self-promotion. If they cared about humans, they would start with the ones who have helped make them trillions of dollars over the years. They went in to small towns across America, destroyed the mom and pop stores that were paying fair wages and were able to offer benefits and Walmart became the only employee option for most people in those regions.   A local newspaper from my parents' town chronicled the changes over a 3 year period after Walmart came into their area and 18 established independent businesses (in a single county) ended up going out of business in that period along with a loss of over 250 jobs.  These were businesses that sold groceries, they were butchers, tire stores, sundry type stores, bakeries, etc. All independent and none could keep up with the 'falling prices.' Of course the problem is with the consumer and where they choose to spend money but that's the one thing you cannot compete against. If you're paying normal prices wholesale for food and supplies, you cannot compete against the prices the world's largest retailer is paying for what they sell.  ||||| I'd rather they pledge to stop selling hormone infused food.  Look into how many kids are starting puberty at ages 6-7 and ask yourself if drinking milk with all those extra hormones is actually safe.  Sure, Walmart food is cheap, but what is it doing to all of us who can't afford to eat "real" food anymore? ||||| why dont they start with healthcare for their own employees and not shitting on the people that make them money.
7849	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	19	The hardest moment of my life was today, when I had to put down Rex.  You raise them and wean them from their mothers so you can become their mother. Their new family. Their real family.  You walk them and feed them and you follow the rules. You fast them once a week to keep their digestive systems in shape.  Clip their toenails.  House train them.  Sleep with them...  Pet them.  You love them. Because you saved them from whatever horrible life they could have had. Without protection, without your special brand of love. They would have never made it. You were their hero. The one they couldn't wait to see every day.  Sometimes you had to discipline them, but it wasn't because you enjoyed that. Chaining them up out back, maybe fasting them an extra day. It's important to be able to see their ribs, anyways. And the look in their eyes after they finally learn. It's not about the power or the control. It's just about the love. You want them to love you and you want them to follow the rules.  But, having to say goodbye.  If they bite, you're supposed to put them down. We live out deep in the country, so we don't have anyone else to do those sorts of things. We have to do it ourselves. And looking into those eyes, knowing they don't quite understand.  Today, in that moment, I could barely keep it all together. I just sobbed while I stood there, about ready for the end.  "I love you, Rex." I said.  "I love you too, mom."  And then I pulled the trigger.  [+]([URL] ||||| I knew where it was going but that didn't take from the good writing. Good job! ||||| All I have is a *shudder* ||||| I kinda saw this coming with the word "babies" in the title, but I liked the story a lot! ||||| Wow, that was great/creepy!  ||||| Top notch story there. Must share with others. Very well written. ||||| That was amazing!  I was confused for a second because the title had baby in it and the story was clearly about a dog (or so I thought.) Good foreshadowing! ||||| Change the title. When the title indicates a human child, but the story begins with the description that makes you think it's an animal, you knew the ending was going to actually be a child. Misdirection is used quite often in SSS so you reader will constantly be trying to guess the switch. Make it less obvious.   Otherwise, good story.  ||||| I read this in no sleep. Still good.  ||||| I knew it was a person from the beginning, but this was still pretty good.

I'm guessing WD-40 isn't the best thing so I thought I should check with people who know more than I do.  Also, are there any good maintenance tips that can keep me and my bike awesome? ||||| I used Crisco on my Huffy when I was a kid. I don't recommend. ||||| I use [Rock 'n Roll Gold]([URL] You can see my [chain wear rate history]([URL] and judge for yourself it is doing the trick or not. I think it is but I am testing out a bottle of [Squirt]([URL] as well on one bike as it seems degreasing the chain is not required and this appeals to me on the touring bike, well on all the bikes actually :). ||||| I use WD-40 to clean the chain, it helps drive out water and debris, it's not good lubricant.  I use [Tri-FLow]([URL] as my chain lube.  My chain clear method:  Spray chain with WD-40 Spin a few times Wipe chain with cloth until not much dirt or oil still comes off Put Tri-Flow on the chain, like a drop per link joint Spin a few times Wipe chain until not much oil comes off  Of course, someone will post that this is wrong.   But I am right, this is the best/simplest way, and they are wrong. ||||| I personally use [Rock n Roll Gold]([URL]  Actually there was just a thread discussing this earlier today where I typed out a long response to this same question!  Here is my [Reply]([URL] I would be glad to give you anymore information if you have any questions. ||||| the WD in WD40 stands for water displacement. WD40 is more of a solvent than a lubricant. it would be effective for cleaning your chain, but not lubricating. if you do use WD40 on the chain to clean, wipe it off as thoroughly as possible, and lubricate appropriately. Oils attract dirt, which can penetrate the pins in your chain, and cause more friction than it prevents. This will decrease the life span of your chain. Personally, I use silicone lube for my gears, chain, and bearings. There is one downside to silicone, which is that water washes it away easily. As a remedy, I make sure to lube my chain frequently. Fortunately, it does NOT rain more than it does rain where I live.. upside to silicone is that it penetrates easily into the pins, does not attract dirt, prevents rust, and it is pretty cheap.  ||||| You don't oil gears. :)  You might pack the bearings with grease, but these days that's pretty rare.  Any old motor oil will do for the chain as long as you wipe off the excess.  A quiet bike is a beautiful bike. :) ||||| Whit Lightning dry lube works great on my trail bike  ||||| All of these are good suggestions but it really does depend on climate and what type of riding you do and where you are riding. ||||| I use Pro-Link.  I think that all oil-based chain lubes are probably about the same, and are superior to wax-based chain lubes. ||||| 30 weight motor oil. ||||| I use 3-in-1 oil until it's running smoothly, then wipe it off the chain with a rag and apply thicker chain lube. ||||| I use chainsaw bar oil under advice from my father, who rides to work every day in the rain or snow. He said once a week he applies a drop to each ring. I smeared some on a rag and ran the chain through it. So far it's working quite well. ||||| First thing! Go to your local bike shop and ask them what they think is the best - the "best" lube varies by region and climate, as well as how much salt/sand is put on the road if you're in a part of the world that has that issue.  Secondly, NEVER use WD-40. It's not a lubricant. They do make a bike line now (which is pretty rad, I demo-ed some today actually) but it's only available through bike shops, so there you go.  Thirdly, I recommend [Chain-L No. 5]([URL] ||||| Use [T-9]([URL] It's the perfect combination of a wet and dry lube, so your getting the best of both worlds! I work at a Bike Shop and this is what I use and recommend daily!
1577	1,3,3,3,3	10	I am new to the Demon class, and I started an Avenger, but how are they compared to the Slayer? Which is more fun? I am enjoying the lack of death and pots on the Avenger at the moment but are they good at all late game? ||||| They're amazing! Very high damage with little funding. I have both a 12x Demon Avenger and Demon Slayer and I much prefer the Avenger. Avengers use an exceed system while Slayer uses a soul system and I find the exceed system much more interesting.   Downside to Demon Avengers, no matter how much health you have always keep an eye on your health because your attacks are based on health percentage and often I find myself low health even when I have over 80k health. Oh and, % health gear is rare.  ||||| I got both to 120 for their link skill so here's my opinion. Demon avenger just seems like a funner class with more skills and a better system(exceed) and is great all the way to and through 4th job. Demon slayer was particularly mindless and that is due to their only good mobbing   skill, demons cry. It's great and all and it makes training from 100+ very fast, but it literally takes no effort of thinking to use it because of the large AOE. ||||| DS can outclass DA with a little funding due to Blue Blood. The main issue is Demon Slayers have really low damage % skills (420% on main skill impact) and DS only gets 1 damage buff. Obviously the other issue is getting %Str. But IMO DA is better than DS without funding.  Edit: fury isn't an issue late game for DS as with hypers and fury regen you never really run out. Also I don't even use potions as leech aura with demon impact and dark metamorphosis keep me at full hp. ||||| My main is 174 DA. I love his Thousand swords skill, and 117k HP. Very little funding and i have a 142k range and HP% equips are relatively cheap. Also getting Decent Hyper Body is a VERY good investment.

3438	1,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,1	37	I suppose it depends on your definition of "pride".   Don't get me wrong. I can take pleasure in learning and taking part in my country's history, traditions and values. But to take PERSONAL satisfaction in such an abstract notion as nationality, something in which I had no choice, to me seems perverse and rather silly.  ||||| When people say that they are proud to be X, then can be saying one or more of these ideas:  * I love my country * If I could to choose were I would born, I would not change it * I have no shame of being X  They are not proud of **themselves** because they had luck to be X, they are proud of **their country.**   A American may not mean to say "I am good because I am American". He is just saying that he loves America.  ||||| In some cases people *do* have a choice in their nationality. Specifically, immigrants. Arnold Schwarzenegger often says that he's [proud to be an American]([URL] and he had to go through a lot of effort to become one.  Even those who were born here have a choice in that they could immigrate elsewhere. When someone says they're proud to be [American/British/Canadian/whatever] what they generally mean is that, as a result of some fundamental aspect of the country, something that they are proud to be associated with has occured. Is that not something worth being proud of? ||||| How about if I say that I'm proud to be American because of the principles upon which it was founded and for which it stands, like freedom of expression, and of the press, and from mandated religion? It makes me damn proud to be a citizen of a country that articulated these ideas in a governing document that has been able to withstand the inevitable strains of progress and modernity, while also recognizing the flaws in the document and allowing for their [eventual] correction. Go America. Go Titans. ||||| While I agree that many people state this pride blindly because it is expected of them, some do it because they do believe they are personally responsible for many of the positive aspects of their nation.  When an individual pays taxes, votes, supports businesses, and participates in activist causes, they are shaping the long-term state of their country. They feel pride in what they consider to be a team effort to improve some small chunk of the Earth.  This pride also serves a pragmatic purpose; Namely that if a person experiences positive reinforcement whenever they improve their environment, they are more likely to continue doing so in the future. ||||| You can think of it as similar to taking pride in your family. If your father was a Nobel prize winning, cancer curing, war hero philanthropist, you'd probably be pretty proud of that. You didn't choose your father, his accomplishments have nothing to do with you. Still, your average person would be proud.  Similarly, if you found out your father was a child molesting, serial rapist literally Hitler, you might feel some shame about that even though your father's crimes have nothing to do with you.  Now I'm not saying that any culture or nation is better than another. But I don't see anything wrong with an American/Briton/Whatever taking pride in being a small part and heir of their nation's great history. ||||| Just checking to see if you're logically consistent.  Do you also think poorly of people who say that they are/events make them ashamed to be their nationality? ||||| It all has to do with in-group/out-group relationships, which are not necessarily a bad thing. It's true that you had no choice in your nationality, but you didn't have choice in a lot of things.  Pretty much what it boils down to is this: I feel closer with my brother than I do with my friends, I feel closer to my friends than I do with my classmates, I feel closer with my classmates than I do with the people in my city, I feel closer with the people in my city than the people in my state, I feel closer with the people in my state than the people in my nation, and I feel closer to the people in my nation than the people in the world.   If you are going to claim that nationalism is silly because of its arbitrariness, the  you must also claim that filial loyalty is silly because of its arbitrariness. I'm sure you have a particularly strong attachment to your family, and you had no choice in that relationship.  But, you might object, my family has had a profoundly personal influence on my life. To this I would respond by saying that so has the nation in which you live. The institutions in which you grew up in profoundly influence the way in which you think. Your parents might have wiped your baby bum when you were a child, but the nation's institutions (such as laws) taught you how to act.  You can be proud to be a part of a nation for a variety of things: history/culture/language/power/morality/constitution/geography/whatever. I take personal satisfaction in being American because, like it or not, I am a part of the American tradition. I have a small piece of power in America, and as such I am responsible in some way for the way America behaves.  Am I always proud to be an American? Of course not. Just like when I feel less satisfied with my familial connection when Uncle Bobby gets drunk and starts hitting on his attractive niece, so too am I ashamed when my country does something which I feel is utterly wretched. ||||| You can be proud of someone else. If you look up "Pride" in the dictionary, it'll say so right there:  >A feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements, **the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated**, or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired  (Source: Google)  When people say "I'm proud to be an American" they mean it in the same sense as "I'm proud of you, son." The word has multiple usages, and we *do* draw a linguistic distinction between them.  Basically, the equivalent situation would be if you told someone at a funeral "I'm sorry for your loss," and they said "Why? You didn't do anything." The word "sorry" can be used to apologize, but it's also a synonym for "sorrowful", so that person's being silly. Pretty much the exact same thing here. ||||| The love of ones country depends on where you are born, you don't see anyone saying i am proud of America, i am French, for example. In this way it is much like religion, which one you are depends where you are born so someone is naturally going to support the one it is born into.  Pride in your nation comes as a result of:  * Agreeing with the way your nation conducts itself in the global stage and what reputation it holds as a result.  * The customs in your nation which you think are a credit to you and other countries envy.  * The people who represent you have special qualities that you can aspire to.  It really boils down to personal preference, you can have national pride about some topics and disdain about others. ||||| you are correct; nationalism is an extension of tribalism.  to quote george carlin:  I saw a slogan on a guys car that said "Proud to be an American" and I thought "What the fuck does that mean?"  I'm fully Irish, and when I was a kid I would go to the St Patrick's Day parade and they sold a button that said "Proud to be Irish", but I knew that on Columbus day they sold the same button only it said "Proud to be Italian", then came Black Pride, and Puerto Rican Pride. And I could never understand national or ethnic pride, because to me Pride should be reserved for something you achieve on your own.  Being Irish isn't a skill, it's a fucking genetic accident.  You wouldn't be proud to be 5'11". You wouldn't be proud to have a pre-disposition for colon cancer.

1422	1,3	11	**Richard**  Richard traced the lines of his father's palm, examining every groove and wrinkle with great care. He'd done it a thousand times before, when he was younger. Whenever Arlorn held him in his arms, he would count the lines in his palm and silently count the ever increasing number.   *So many.*   Seven and sixty years Arlorn had seen; a plethora of summers and countless winters. *How many suns have these eyes watched set?* The Lord of Crow's Nest stirred lightly as Richard gave the weathered hand a slight squeeze. Old eyes blinked open as if hesitant to gaze out of their darkness, but they did all the same. "Jon..." He murmered lightly, "...Jon. Oh, Jon...I dreamed that I was old."   Richard pursed his lips, but gave a soft nod as his father continued to murmur mutely. Jon Morrigen had been dead for decades, though Arlorn called out for him near every day. *Does he still live in his dreams?* His father blinked again, and - for half a moment - seemed disappointed. "Oh, Richard." He greeted warmly, "I was...dreaming is all...dreaming. I, I think that I need to find Helena."   "Mother is away," Richard assured him. "Maester Anders is tending to her, she's caught another cold." His eyes wandered to the nearby window, where powdered snow clung to the stone ledge and frosted on the glass.   "Well, no wonder." He replied, giving a shiver. "Cold...cold like this, in, in, in, in summer? Unheard of...inconceivable...."   "It's winter, father."   "Well yes, I know." He stammered, trying to form words. "I, I, I, I need to get Torrance...because Jon...Jon thinks that we're going to Grandview, but Torrance lost the melee there, and, and..." His voice trailed off as he suddenly found interest in some corner of the room. Richard found himself enjoying when his father could regale times of his youth. Sometimes they made sense, and it seemed as though nothing was wrong with the man. Other times - most times - it was nothing more then an incoherent string of sentences that held little or no meaning with each other - a ball of mismatched yarn.   "He'll be back shortly, I'm sure." He said, trying to calm his father down. Arlorn ceased his stirring for a moment, and his eyes met Richard's with a new found sense of realization. *Does he remember me?*     "Torrance." He stated plainly, "Oh, Torrance...mother was worried about you. Said...said, and you were at the melee at Grandview...and Hugh didn't *mean* to..."   Richard turned as a hand gave a firm squeeze on his shoulder. Maester Anders loomed over the bedside with a heavy head and weary eyes. *He's been tending to father near every day and night...no easy task I am sure.*   "Now, now, Arlorn." the young Maester began with a smile. "Tell us again about the time you sailed the Sea of Dorne in that storm."   "Oh, well Torrance, Callidan, and I...we had set out from Nightsong with a galley...rusty old thing...*The Dornishman's Wife*, Torrance...Torrance called her..." He gave a wheezy laugh, not paying any particular attention as Anders pulled a small vial from his robes. He swirled the liquid about before pouring it into a small cup of wine.   "*The Dornishman's Wife*, did he really?" He replied with a chuckle, though he'd surely heard the story half a hundred times. "And what of that storm?" He gingerly held the cup to Arlorn's lips, urging the liquid forward in small drops.   "We...we were miles from land," He said between sips, ",and Callidan wished to turn back...but...but Torrance had been so worried that Alyssa would think him craven. He pushed *The Dornishman's Wife* past her limits, the winds....winds blew down on us like the, the, the *Gods* were trying to blow Storm's End down!" He finished the wine, and quickly enough, his eyes began to sag and flutter. "And I told Torrance...told him we had to turn back, but he didn't...didn't want to. Was so worried about Alyssa...*craven*. Didn't want to be a *craven*."   A moment of lucidity seemed to creep onto the Lord of Crow's Nest's face as he looked from Anders, and then to Richard. "I wish he would have stopped worrying about what others thought. He just wanted to be like Jon, but...but father...father didn't think *anyone* could be like Jon. Not even Torrance." He paused, lips trembling as his throat caught the words. "...and I think that killed him."   After a few more mumbled words, Arlorn Morrigen drifted off to sleep again; to a place where his mind didn't need to torture itself with half remembered truths. *I wonder if he dreams...*   "Milk of the poppy." Anders stated matter of factly as Arlorn's chest began to rise and fall. "And a bit of Strongwine, all to help him sleep...and dream." Richard passed a hand through his fathers thinning gray hair, remembering how he had once done the same - long, long ago.   "Does he hurt?" He asked, no more then a child.   "No." Anders replied softly. "Not while he sleeps."   *It's not fair. The Gods see fit to put a decent man on this earth, only to torment him in old age.* He ground his teeth as tears formed at the back of his eye. *It's not fucking fair.*   "M'lord?" A Septa called from the door hesitantly. "M'lord, it's Lady Genna."   Richard stood, feeling his gut drop like a stone. *Does she know?* He hadn't told her of Forrestwatch...of what had happened there. When he looked into those swirling sapphire eyes, he couldn't bring himself to tell her of the countless babies he'd killed. "What's wrong?" He asked hurriedly. "Where is she?"   "At the top of the Keep, m'lord."  ||||| /u/pauix

2066	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	9	Sandow is more over than he's ever been, and the general audience seems to be getting behind him as well, not just the attending IWC smarks. But let's say that he does turn on the Miz. His "character" as of late has just been clever mimicry of the Miz. Even before that, he was coming out in weekly costumes with his own spin on them, but did not really have his own defined personality since dropping the intellectual savior bit. Granted he's shown a lot of personality and talent, so where does he go from there? Damien Mizdow won't have staying power because it will be out of context. Does he go back to weekly impersonations, Charlie Haas style, or try something new altogether? ||||| damien sandow. serious role. push him to the moon. ||||| It's a shame Miz doesn't have the Intercontinental Championship still as I'd like to have seen Sandow turn on Miz claiming that he was only helping Miz win because he wanted to keep the title close to himself. When they finally have a match Sandow wins with ease as he literally reverses every move that Miz throws at him; thanks to all the months being his stunt double he can now read Miz like a book. ||||| The Miz becomes unwatchable again. ||||| He goes after a title. ||||| Damien Mizdow takes over The Miz's life, and actually becomes him. Some psychological horror movie type thing I don't know. ||||| Becomes intellectual savior again... Brings back robe, holds mic like wine glass, I can dream...

1090	1,3,3,3,3,3,2	15	Last year I went to Identity festival in Toronto and was looking forward to it this year aswell, but it seems that no information is being released and that the festival site now just appears as a large company logo for sge (the production company behind the festival). I hope I am just jumping to a conclusion but it looks like its not touring this year. It's a shame really... it was 40 dollars and had tons of great headliners. ||||| Hopefully that just means that they are building this years site. ||||| I went on their site to see if they had announced anything about this year's festival (which I think they had, the venue is different from Echo Beach) last week, and it wasn't the SGE logo. My guess is the SGE is there while the're building the website for this years festival. Keep checking back, it might not be done for! ||||| I check that site every week and before it went to the company logo it said "2013 dates and locations coming soon!"  Don't worry guys it's happening.  ||||| I got early bird tickets last year for $25 bucks. It's the best festival for that amount of money, and me and my buddies end of summer tradition. I hope it's still happening ||||| It might not, it didn't make as much money as expected. I worked as a sound tech for them, and when I got paid at the end of the tour, a few of my bosses had a meeting and they did not sound happy or mention/ask me or any other techs back. Just sayin, not that it won't,  but like skrillexs train tour that got cancelled, It may be the same or they may announce it soon :) ||||| Doctor P, Noisia, and Excision back to back?

7420	1,2,3	4	Why hello there. I didn't see you come in. I appear to have a conundrum.  I'm trying to make an instant messaging type of program using Java. I have the client set up and the server almost set up. I'm just having trouble getting the clients IP address. This is throwing the exception:      MyStreamSocket myDataSocket = new         MyStreamSocket(myConnectionSocket.accept());          String ip = myDataSocket.getInetAddress().getHostName();     //it's declaring the "ip" String that hits the error  Also, could this have anything to do with it being "localhost" as I only have one machine at the moment?  ****EDIT**** Had the wrong code in. Was just experimenting with some stuff just to try to stumble upon the answer:     //String ip = myDataSocket.getInetAddress()..getHostName(); ***********  The error is a NullPointerException ||||| Why do you want to grab the IP of the server hosting? ||||| Ok this is where it becomes intresting, depending on where you are trying to talk to you will have a different IP address. if you are after your "local" ip address (i.e. the IP on your local network) use somethings along the lines of:  Enumeration <NetworkInterface> allInterfaces = java.net.NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces() ; while (allInterfaces.hasMoreElements()) { InetAddress addr=allInterfaces.nextElement().getInetAddresses(); // Do something here. } You have to remember that a machine can have multiple interfaces and a interface can have multiple IP addresses. ..  now if you are after the 'public internet' ip then you should probbably query a 'whats my ip' service to ensure that you can get ahold of the public IP..  Now...... a quick read of your design shows that there are flaws because it will probbably not survive going through NAT..  My advice would be refactor your design so you only need to know the IP of the central server.

1359	1,3,3	4	  Dave was a man who lived in a standard house, he played many games, including this very game.  He would play it over the weekend during his free time.  He absolutely loved it.  The repetitive farming, grinding, and every now and then your average spending, it was delightful.  Maxing his characters was his goal, to complete all quests and achievements.  He, however, did not check his message box, for he knew what was inside.  Hatemail.    Of the worst kind, all because some people breathed this game and lived it.  It was their holy grail of video games.  Dave, however was not as serious, when he lost, he wasn't that pissed.  All of those people would vent their frustration out on Dave, a hapless soul who tried his best.  All of that hate would build up inside of his unchecked messages, he never went into it.  Until one day, he had to clean it out.  Is.    The moment he opened the message box, salt poured in, and in a matter of seconds, his entire house was filled with salt.  Dave was doomed; his body dehydrated instantly, and he became a dried out shell of his former self.  The people of his town decided to burn his house, so the salt could never hurt anyone else, because it was still flowing out.  The people mourned for his loss, and they decided to burn his body along with it, because the people knew he would want to go out in style.  It was in his will, which included division of wealth, land, etc., but something seemed to be off about the last line.  H__R__L, __ey _r_, _h__ sha__ k__w m_ _a_e!  *Dave*  What people didn't know was that he had placed a curse upon us, The Curse of Dave.  This curse changed the game forever, causing many to leave due to the lag never ceasing despite Toylogic trying it's best.  The spenders were screwed with horrible rates, they rarely got what they wanted.  And all this time, the people blamed Toylogic, but it's not them.  They can't control him; they can't fix the problems he cause.  It's DAVE.  And he watches you play, every single day you get on.  He controls you.  You will spend for useless crap, lag for days, and play mindlessly for hours.  While he watches you curse the name Toylogic, he rolls in his grave.  For we never consider this man, watching us from afar.   *Hurtful, they are, they shall know my name!*  **Dave**  And that's how we got screwed over.  Jk, Jk.

4140	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,3,2,2,2	23	I was wondering what would the best way to go about starting to get noticed would be? Would it be wise to put out vocals of me singing popular EDM songs on SoundCloud? Or would it be better to just ask people if I could sing on their tracks?  One of the biggest problems I, personally, notice people having is looking for singers to sing on their tracks, hence why I was wondering if asking people if I could sing on their tracks would be effective. ||||| I'm going to tell you a little secret.  Every one I know who makes electronic music wants one of 2 things or  both.  * A good rapper to work with.  * A good singer to work with.  If you're a vocalist with range, can write their own lyrics and is able to work WITH a producer on a track (not just send acapellas and expect them to be slapped over a beat) you could be on 20 releases before the years out.  Vocalists are always in demand because quite frankly, a lot of them think they're 'above' electronic music, don't realize its a good way to get on a range of music very fast or expect to be on a clone of *insert popular artist name here* 's track.   ||||| Do you have any examples of you singing?  ||||| Having a SoundCloud account like you said might not be a bad idea. I, for one, specifically keep an eye out ("ear out", so to speak) for vocalists on SC who are doing good work but seem like they might be approachable. A YouTube account can be good for a similar reason.  If nothing else, such an account is a convenient place to link people to when they want to hear samples of how you sound.  Even so, the other strategy of straight up asking producers if they're interested in working with a vocalist would probably be a good way to go too. I mean, singers are always in demand for EDM. ||||| Hey,  You can try asking producers to sing on their tracks here: /r/NeedVocals  Personally I have found my singer there :) ||||| you should post some of your accapellas on here so people can actually get an idea of what you sounds like.  ||||| i am currently free to work on a new project. so if you are into pop-ish edm just pm me. do you have any demo of you singing? ||||| To start with, I suggest putting up a few covers of popular songs. Then I guess just try and find producers to work with. Network well and build a social following or become friends with producers, as well as join facebook groups aimed at music production etc  If you're a good writer/ vocalist and you work with someone who has a decent following you can start to branch out I guess  If you're keen to do some vocals on a Melbourne Bounce track then send over a preview of what you can do and I might consider working with you in the future. I have a little over 2k followers on soundcloud but there are heaps of producers that want to work with vocalists :) ||||| Where are you from? Maybe you can find people on this sub that are in your area.  ||||| thats what i do i suggest make sure you dont spend time hopping on just any edm record best thing is to find a producer around you who is good and contact them. try to get in the session with them so yo can work together. artists are always looking for vocalists. also if anything try to if your going to sing a popular edm song or you own song put a video of your singing it on youtube maybe acapella. so you can hear the voice clearly ||||| Before looking for producers to work with, I suggest making a soundcloud, uploading some examples of your work and (most importantly) creating an image for yourself. Make yourself look legit. I suggest you take a picture of yourself that identifies with the sound you want to be apart of. Also a logo wouldn't be a bad idea either.  Personally, I feel like the EDM scene is based on more than just the music. It's about personality and image as well. ||||| please pm me  ||||| Message us ||||| I find quite a few vocalists and I am thrilled with the results. A few times I had to tailor projects to their style more than to mine but overall great experiences. I can't give away my secret, though.

Plenty of producers post online that they are looking for singers, just start networking. ||||| If you have a acapella around can you post it.

In MUN, students will be assigned a country, where they have to research problems of the country and propose a solution.  Well I'd like to hear any problems or pet peeves you have about anything related to Taiwan, that I could possibly implement into one of my speeches or position papers. I think it'd be a good form of research to ask the people of Taiwan about the problems in the country, so I came to the subreddit. Thanks!  ||||| ... a Model UN conference that has a Taiwan delegation wouldn't be a very good model of the real thing, would it? ||||| I recommend meeting up with the PRC reps and taking them out for KTV and getting them very drunk before the event.

But unlike yours, our delegates were actually from their respective countries. The experience resembled real life so much it was uncanny.  The first thing the Chinese delegate tried to do was to expel us from the conference, on the grounds that Taiwan is already represented by them. The constant nagging never ended throughout the entire conference. The U.S. delegates have no clue what's wrong between us, the Koreans won't help, and only the Japanese sympathize us and helped us whenever they can. It was a constant struggle to wrestle influence from the Chinese, and we ended up in a coalition with an African pact for mutual support on numerous issues.   If I learnt anything, it would be that Taiwan's position in the international community won't really improve much even if we are properly represented. The economic power China welds is too great for most countries to ignore, and even for those countries that sympathize Taiwan, eventually must cave in to China's demands. ||||| Sigh.

Also, any agreements made with pre-Mao China also are invalid.     Allow Taiwan into the IMF. (and the UN)    Never, never, never refer to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei."

1571	1,3,3	5	Hello MUA's! I'm  looking for step by step instructions on how best to apply my foundation, and I need it as ELI5 as possible. No matter what I try, I cannot get it to work properly for me. I have dry skin (mild exzema, mostly on my legs but roughness on my face) and try very hard to make my skin look okay. My face is also a little red, some freckles and very pale.   I will update this post with pictures of my skin and with foundation applied.    Reason for this post is I've  had a major stress-breakout and want to tidy up my face. Looking for contructive help and quickly, I'll  be up getting ready for work at 5am tomorrow!       Rundown of products I have that would be for this:     Maybelline fit 115 liquid foundation (this one feels like its a bit strong/dark for me, not too sure how to explain better. May be because I've typically applied  it heavily.)   Also in stick version and 130 that I've kinda attempted with contouring      NYX Invincible in FAIR (INF02) This one feels closest to my skin color but applies horrribly, looks super flaky    Maybelline DreamLumi touch highlighting concealer      Covergirl simply ageless cream foundation in 215. Little dark but applies better than others with primer   Elf mineral face primer - the green one, definitely notice it helps neutralize and it feels amazing     NYX matte finish setting spray     Random green concealer thingy from drugstore, no idea the brand.     Mary Kay timewise moisturizer for face- most effective moisturizer I've found for myself.    Beauty blender   A few different brushes for application (just tell me recommended ones and I'll try  and find best one.)    Thank you lovelies! All help is greatly appreciated :)  [URL] No makeup barefaced from a week ago, just had upper wisdom teeth out a day or two previously   [URL]  Foundation weird spottiness. Was wearing NYX invisible with elf primer underneath. Can spot some of the acne.

Also I work in a bank with awesome big windows and decent amounts of natural lighting so not super heavy needed ||||| Make sure to exfoliate and moisturize! This will go a long way in helping to combat the dry skin areas that look flakey when covered with foundation. I use a clarisonic for daily face washing/exfoliation, but there are many similar products available on the market. I also suffer from mild/moderate acne and I find that physicians formula concealer in green (sorry not at home to get product name) works amazingly to cover my redness. The tiniest bit goes a long way, and make sure to blend it out. As far as foundation application goes, I feel every girl has their own technique. What works best for me is dabbing several spots on each area of foundation then stippling and blending it all out with a thick brush (I use urban decay's good karma optical blurring brush) and it gives me an almost flawless coverage. A lot of people love the beauty blender so you may want to try that as well! Ps you have amazing cheek bones! Don't be afraid to add a slightly darker contour just underneath them and up into your hairline! Show those puppies off! ||||| Your skin naturally is in better condition than mine. I'd suggest a good moisturizer to keep the eczema and dry patches at bay.   For apply foundation try a nice brush. I love the eco tools custom buffing brush! I find its much more hygienic and less harsh on my skin versus using fingers.
4314	1,3	7	Hi,  This is a little hard to explain, but I'll do my best to keep it simple.  Exchange Servers - Roles - Site EXCH01 - MBX/HUB/CAS - Site1 EXCH02 - FSW/HUB/CAS - Site1 EXCH03 - MBX/HUB/CAS - Site2  We are planning on moving EXCH01 and EXCH02 to a new datacenter, "Site3." I have already moved the FSW (EXCH02). I'm already aware of the DNS changes that need to made during the move as well as the firewall rules, my main concern is the Outlook users. Each of the Exchange servers are a member of the same CAS Array. Does that mean if I properly take down EXCH01 (the first mailbox server) by switching the owner of the database to the second mailbox server, EXCH03, and stopping replication, users using Outlook will still have connectivity? Does Outlook look towards the CAS Array for it's information on what mailbox servers to connect to?  I'm sorry in advance if this is confusing or was not explained very well. I wanted to keep my question very simple to avoid unneeded complexity.  Thanks ||||| A CAS Array is per AD site, so all of its members are automatically added based on AD site. However, this has nothing to do with how you load balance CAS.   Having said that, Outlook will still continue to connect to the CAS Array name as long as it resolves to something. This is because the RPCClientAccessServer value of their Mailbox Database has not changed (still pointing to the old CAS; assuming it was setup correctly in the first place). There's some other weird stuff that could happen & it's easier to just have you read these two blog posts  [URL]  [URL]    Now it would seem you could just use the Set-ClientAccessArray command with the -Site parameter to change the AD site of the CAS Array when you perform the relocation & everything **should** connect fine; assuming it's still resolvable to one of those CAS.   Interesting scenario as I've never had to do it but the articles should get you started in the right direction.  also, you might want to look at modifying the AutoDiscover SiteScope on the servers when you perform the move  [URL]

He's had every chance to build a decent relationship with me my entire life, we've lived in the same house for over 20 years, but he still ignores me and refuses to pay any attention to me.

And no, I do not ask for his birthday because I want to give him a present or do anything for him. It's just awkward not knowing if today is his birthday or not.   He's a lazy sack of shit who refuses to do housework and spends his time playing iPhone games and watching TV. I was about to say he does all of those things on his freetime but only people who do shit around the house really get to use have that. He has an obligation to help out but he doesn't do anything besides the stereotypical "masculine" duties like mowing the lawn or destroying the lawn with shitty grass growing tactics.   Being around him creates this ultra shitty mood where everyone has to watch their mouths if they don't want to set him off and it's not even scary when he is set off. It's extremely annoying like someone's child is in your face screaming and you know you'll get into too much shit for stopping him so you put up with it.   I really wish my mom would realize how much of a scumbag he is and I want him out of my life. If they ever divorce, there is no question that I will be no contact with him. I will never if my life have an urge to ever contact him. Is it too much to ask my mom to divorce him? I think it's very much possible that she'll listen to me but I'm not sure. I know this path won't be easy but it's really difficult as it is being near him or knowing that I will have to deal with him for the rest of my life.   Can anyone give me any advice? I'm scared that cutting him out of my life would mean I'd have to spend less time around the family that I love spending time. I don't want a useless dirtbag getting in the way of my family or any of my happiness.  ||||| You will drive yourself insane by trying to influence your parents' marriage; that craziness is all between them, no matter how they try to drag you in. I am in my mid 20s and my mother has flirted with the idea of divorcing my NDad for 18 years! My dad was and still is a walking bomb with random temper tantrums.  You need to get yourself out of this toxic environment, and then you'll be in a better place to help your family. But even then, if your mom wants to stay with him, all you can do is offer varying levels of support.

My current setup is MVP T Davis, base Lavonte David, and 2 Lamberts in the middle. I guess my question is, is it best to have 2 rushers (Von millers) on the outside, or 1 rusher and 1 coverage guy? Also I'm looking at TotW Mack and he looks like an amazing run stuffer and good (85) zone coverage. Anyone who's used him, how is he?  Edit: Thanks for the advice.  ||||| TOTY dumervil and TG suggs. ||||| I run 94 Khalil Mack at ROLB and 95 Justin Houston at LOLB.

HIGHLY recommended. Got me two pick 6s and 3 sacks in a single game today. As far as LOLB, I'm a bit unconventional and use MLB Clay Matthews for his speed and hit power even though his awareness is super low. At MLB I use 97 Keuchly and MLB2 is 95 Peppers for usering. The two Lamberts work just fine though so I wouldn't worry about that.

I used to have violent fantasies about hurting women, and at one point tortured animals, but I'm in therapy, and I hope to one day get those urges completely under control. I'm going to be 100% certain I would never act on those urges before I get into a relationship.  Should I admit that to a future SO?  Should I also admit that I was sexually abused when I was younger?  Would that be too much to handle at once? Should I confess one thing first, and then wait a few months before telling her the second? Which should I bring up first?  Assuming that the relationship had otherwise been going great, how would you react?  Please be completely honest.     **tl;dr**: When I get into a relationship, should I mention that I used to have violent sexual urges when I was younger? Should I tell her I was sexually abused as a child? ||||| If this is real, it seems like a perfect question for your therapist.  ||||| You posted this already.

7524	1,3,3,3	12	Me and her have been long distance pen pals for 3 years. She's shy, not a lot of friends, and has past anxiety issues. She told me, in a way, that she loved me and wanted me to visit last year. I couldn't, because I was barely making payments month to month (Americorp salary). Maybe I could've skipped on some common luxuries, I guess I messed up because I didn't. We agreed again to meet last October, but I was robbed of my phone and wallet (with monthly transport cards); I lost and had to replace $600 dollars. Money that I saved for the trip.  &nbsp;  I want to say that maybe she moved on, because she started dating a lot of guys and tell me about it on the regular. I treated it like I didn't care and just went on asking her how it went and such. So I assumed I was out of the picture for now as a potential, which I was ok with; I could've pushed for an LDR, but her being in college for another 3 years and me still interning for my career, wouldn't be feasible to be together anytime soon.  &nbsp;  That didn't stop her from texting me almost 24/7 and FaceTime probably 5 hours a day this past month; more active than usual. I was ok with this and gave her attention, because I liked it. I assumed I was either a really good friend or still a potential, leaning more towards just being a friend.  &nbsp;  Until three days ago when I noticed she never asks me about my day or how I am. Not only that, but I went through our message history and she never asks anything about me; over a year of messages and FaceTime conversations. It was usually about her, her dates, literature and random small talk. So I lead her into the conversation when she said she wanted to talk to a cool stranger. I asked: "Why?" "What questions would you ask them." She said "IDK it depends." I pushed it with "Depends on what?" She said IDK again, then got suspicious and asked if I'm trying to find something out. I said yes. I told her, "I started to notice you never asked me questions and I don't remember a time when you ever did."   &nbsp;  She agreed with what I said and started to get defensive and asked why was I looking at our chat history.   &nbsp;  "I explained that I was trying to find out a time when you did." I couldn't believe it when she said "Oh well, so what?" I said "Yeah, so what." She said **No I mean, what's the point?** I was still astonished and said **The point is that it comes off as you don't really care to know me. It' makes me feel like you're disinterested about my life.**  &nbsp;  *A couple days earlier she mentioned she gets bored a lot and said "Sometimes she feels like she uses people when she's bored," regarding to the people on tinder she talks to. I brought that up and said, "It reminds me, when you told me that you use people when you're bored."*  &nbsp;  We talked more, she took what I was saying as a joke. Until I said "Look at what we talk about" she replied "Boys (heart eye emoji)" I replied "Even then when I ask you about them your descriptions of them are 'fluff'.  &nbsp;  *Which is true. I thought maybe she was trying to protect me, but she really is shallow in how she explains someone; they are cute. She's always telling me how everyone just wants to fuck, but I think she's oblivious that in her not getting to know the other person, the only thing left to off by is attraction/lust.*  &nbsp;  She then got angry and said ok, but I pushed for her to tell me what she understands. She avoided answering me and then starts to say she isn't in the mood to go through this. I thought we were adults, like what mood? She said goodnight and left.  &nbsp;  After writing this, maybe I was too direct (?) in me questioning her, but it still is of importance. No matter if I'm her friend or crush, to not be asked "How was your day?" or "What did you do today?" makes me feel unappreciated. I don't think any person was ever this direct with her about a personal issue and maybe she was too scared to deal with it.  &nbsp;  Maybe she didn't ask me personal questions for the sake of saving it for when we met. But after writing, I'm now assuming she stopped seeing me like that years ago and just readily used me as someone to fill her time.   &nbsp;  I tried messaging her a few things and got back one liners, her tumblr is full of quotes about rejection, heartbreak, people leaving. Jeez, it sounds like I'm talking about a child. I just told her that she never asked me any questions like inquiring about my day and this shit happens.  &nbsp;  I do like her, but I don't think she's good for me anymore. Not like this. I even asked her "Do you not want to talk to me anymore?" And she said "No" and decided not to say anymore than that.  &nbsp;  **I'll give it a couple of weeks to see how it ends up.**  &nbsp;  My friends suggest that she's just young and inexperienced in friendships/relationships, which is unfortunate for me. Which meant to move on and forget her. If she comes back around and changes that's good, if not, oh well.  &nbsp;  However, was I out of line about approaching her for a reason why she doesn't ask me questions? Could it be that she's dealing with it as if she's hurt by it?  &nbsp;  I also realize that brevity hasn't flowed through my written, apologies. One thing that isn't brief is how much time we've spent together, and although I don't want to completely abandon her, temporarily abandoning seems like an option; but a seemingly childish one. What to do?   &nbsp;   Similar experiences/stories would be much welcomed.  &nbsp;  **TLDR:**  &nbsp;  **I told my friend/crush that she doesn't ask me questions about my life and she got defensive and stopped talking to me. Wtf?**       ||||| Friends for three years and she doesn't know anything about you?  She's using you for attention. Don't play into that shit.

There's a deal on /r/gundeals that has it for around ~350 shipped which is a great deal for a sight that:  1. Leave constantly on for about 2 years so its always ready to go.  2. Has a very well hidden emitter that rarely (if ever) shows up in your view.  3. Has a lower 1/3rd mount that uses an auto torque limiting thumb screw that lets you mount it without having to break out any tools.  4. Is night vision compatible if that's your thing.   Or a 1-4x.

I would start off with lots of running and bodyweight, but then move on to something like SealFit (SealFit.com)   Before you do anything, read a couple of books about the whole selection process.  It's much, MUCH more than just physical.  I'm sure you're aware of it, but you should have all the information before devoting so much time and energy to the physical aspect.  For this purpose I can recommend the book "Chosen Soldier."  Best of luck!

I can't see no hoverchairs though :) ||||| Very impressive Kaddak! Now give me a key so I can visit everyday. ||||| I took a break so some of the pack collections I fell behind with as now obscene prices, I still have lots of parts ready - so Revans helmet etc (no bracers or belt) - but here is my collection - just missing the ridiculously priced mounts, 100% pets, emotes and toys though :)  [URL] ||||| Wow.. not sure I could stand the noise of that many materializing at once when you get in/out of range. Or is that not what happens in your SH?  I had started a speeder collection in my Nar Shaddaa SH, putting them in the lower "garage" including the balconies.  Whenever you got to the spawn point on the upper level it was a crescendo of speeders materializing noise. Take a few steps and de-materializing.  Head into one of the upper rooms, same deal.  You were just on the edge of that range threshold that it wanted to render or remove them. Was nuts and ended up removing them.  Since speeders are "parked" thought it would be easier for them to just be static non animated displays but that isn't going to happen. 
6590	1,3	6	A few months ago I saw the last two presentations out of a six-part neuroscience series, and it's finally occurred to me to look for the others. It was on the University of Arizona channel, but it seemed much too big to be exclusive -- someone's gotta know something about it.  The lion's share of the fifth episode was about serotonin genetics; long copies and short copies of serotonin genes.  The sixth episode went into sensory error margins, particularly those of bats' ears and humans' eyes, and described why neural filters must exist to take care of background noise.  It was a powerpoint type presentation, with a team spokesperson on stage and a large screen in the background. Each presentation was two hours long, IIRC. I don't recall any videos included, except for maybe a few short clips. It was five-star entertainment, and I'm sorry I couldn't find it in searches of the subreddit -- there's no way it flew under the radar.  ---  Solved in comments, thanks Bearsnare!

It should handle most games at high to ultra settings at 40+ fps. ||||| Assuming you get the rebate, yeah its a very good deal.  ||||| considering amd just dropped the retail price of the r9 280 to like $200, it seems like a "standard sale" with rebate.
5859	1,3,3,3,3	6	So me and a few friends created a 5v5 team just to see how high we could get placed and we played our 5 seeding matches. Keep in mind we all have high silver low gold MMR. We won our first 3, closely lost our second, then rolled the 5th roughly 20 kills ahead. We were expecting to get placed close to where our MMR is based (high silver low gold) and got placed Bronze 4?! This doesn't make much sense to me, is there something im missing here? ||||| Ranked 5's has it's own MMR. Your team mates probably have shit MMR from lozing way too many games so you placed low by playing with them ||||| No, this makes perfect sense. I've gone 5-0 with all High Plat - Low Diamond players and got placed in Gold 2. Also winning by a certain amount of kills is irrelevant. Even if you had gone 5-0 you probably would have only got Silver 5 at best. Ranked 5s is a lot different than solo queue. ||||| I'v won 5/5 with avg gold v mmr like during the summer when i was a pleeb lol, anyway gotplaced silver 1 but had gold 3 mmr  ||||| You have to have really high 5's MMR to get placed anywhere above gold 5 at best. The highest I've placed is diamond 5, and that was on a team with 3 d1 players and two challenger players, all whom had season 3 experience in "higher" elo (plat +) 5's teams. 
6058	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	16	So let me start this off by saying I've actually been doing Youtube let's plays for about 3 years. My friends and I had a channel that got pretty big for us (200 subs, about 50 views a day).  However, when I left for college we all split up, the channel died and we deleted it out of sadness and stupidity. I've started a solo channel now, and I'm doing an experiment: Before, I did one video a day with a lot of editing and cuts. Very low attention span stuff, very jumpy, very almost Markiplier-like if I had to make a comparison to a top dog. Now with my new channel I'm uploading six videos a day that don't even ever touch premiere. I just record with audio raw into OBS, then change the number on a thumbnail preset, and upload. I haven't done it long enough to see if this is an improvement or not for me, but I'm curious what you all think. Should it be quantity or quality when starting out? ||||| It's always about quality mate, doesn't matter if it takes 2 weeks to make one video, if the quality of the content is good-the audience will come. Now i'm not saying that if you spent 2 weeks on making your next video, you'll suddenly have lots of people watching it. It takes time to figure out your own style of editing, once you have established that style and made a few videos (20 possibly), and gone out to get some exposure to the videos, the i believe you will slowly but surely attract an audience.  ||||| Well, for starters, I admire your tenacity at uploading 6 videos a day. That's pretty impressive. So kudos to that.  However... 6 videos a day, is A LOT of content for an audience member to consume. I don't know what length of video you're going for but if you are aiming for the "golden time" of 10-15 minutes that's at least an hour of time someone is spending on your channel. That's great for your channel metrics and analytics, but the likely hood of a user staying around or coming back to your channel for those videos can't be all that high, I would imagine. 6 videos a day is a lot of content to consume. Personally, I would cut that back to maybe 2 a day and get yourself a good backlog going in case issues arise when recording.  For quality vs. quantity? Quality trumps it. Easily. This doesn't mean you have to spend 8 hours a day editing your videos, throwing in graphics, crazy text flying everywhere, lots of jump cuts, or anything like that. But you need to make sure, at the very least, that your voice audio is synced up with gameplay, audio levels are good, and maybe any other minor video corrections you may want to make. Personally, I probably spend about an hour editing my videos and I don't do much for editing and I'm happy with my quality (but I'm not saying I'm the highest quality channel out there either).  On the topic of time to edit and what not, this brings me back to the backlog. If you record a bunch in one go and only release 1 or 2 videos a day you'll be able to give yourself some more breathing room when it comes to editing. Record a bunch one day. Next day, use that time to edit. You can still have videos released and not feel stressed out about missing a day.  Quality over quantity. Always. There are a lot of things that will turn an audience away really quickly and sub-par quality is the quickest way to have someone nope out of video.  You say you're a music producer so you probably do have the equipment and skills available to make sure your audio is great on the first go, but I would still at least look through the tracks to make sure all is kosher.  Your Titan should handle everything so I don't think you should be too worried about video quality. OBS does a pretty good job. You may want to tweak settings to make sure you're getting the very best though (if you're shooting for 1080p60fps).  I guess my main points here are that you should probably cut back on how many videos you're releasing a day and give yourself a backlog. Make sure to run your audio through Premiere for at least a quick glance to make sure everything looks good. Maybe tweak video settings to make sure your video is up to snuff as well.  All this being said...I'm in no way any kind of authority on what's good and/or bad. Just my experiences and observations from other channels and the advice given here.  Hope some of this helps! Good luck and have fun! ||||| Being the perfectionist that I am I always strive for quality, it's part of the reason why I haven't uploaded anything in about a month. Nothing I've recorded strikes me as interesting or entertaining enough to actually spend the time editing and posting lately. ||||| Quality. If you're starting out and want to just get people following you, you need to make sure that every video is the best it can be to grow your community from nothing to something.  Making the latest video your best video is a really good mind-set in general. ||||| I've been doing a video a day, every day a week, but with each set I schedule to upload, Improve each video. Ive onlybeen lets playing since late november, This week I have decided to switch my schedule as I am starting to get a groove on simple editing and feeling better about the audio, and even got a little intro . Its all very basic but the point is, I'm glad I released video how I did, (one a day) just to improve and get expierence. If I did one a week, I feel like the improvements wouldn't be the same in the same amount of time.   Now I'm aiming for 2 videos 3 days a week.one in each series. This gives me a bit moretime to focus on each one a bit more and be more creative with editing.  ||||| Quality quality quality. 6 videos per day is a massive amount of content. If I were a viewer, I would never be able to keep up. In my opinion, I'd rather watch 1 well edited video than 5 videos that haven't been edited.  That said, perfectionism is also bad. Don't get so focused on quality that you never release anything. Strive for perfection, but understand that it is not achievable.  ||||| quality. 2 reasons. 6 videos a day is excessive, and you will barely get any views. and those 6 vids a day probably dont look that good. so quality all the way ||||| Quality, always quality. ||||| I'm going to buck the trend here a bit. I don't think quality is quite the be all end all ppl are putting it out to be. That said, you should be looking to improve it, but it has to work within your own process. Everyone is different and has a different audience. People watch youtube because they feel connected to the creator. If it was all about quality, they'd be watching netflix or cable since as small budget creators we can't compete on the "quality" front with them. But the results don't lie and the results are a majority of young people watch youtubers. So quality isn't everything. Being who you are, finding your voice, being the unique version of yourself. This is what attracts people. Should you strive to improve? Yes. But don't think it's just about getting a better thumbnail, better software and better editing that it will make you better.  All that said, 6 vids is a lot of videos. I do 5 vids a week and I feel like it's too much sometimes, even though I don't edit them that much. I think you'll want fewer than that since as Break of Day said, it's a lot of videos for a viewer to consume. Focus on who you want as an audience and make the videos to suit that. Try to get engagement on the videos and interact with them in the comments. You'll find what works and how many videos your audience wants.

1705	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	27	My FLGS has a championship coming up in a few days and I literally just purchases the core set this week.  While it would be fun to nab the participant prize and possibly play a couple of rounds, I don't want to cause aggravation by playing slowly and probably asking several rules clarifications.  Do I enter the tournament, get blown out, learn along the way and get my first ever alt art card?  Or do I just go as a spectator, keeping two core decks in my pack just in case someone gets a bye  and has time for a side match?  ||||| Go! Just make sure your lists are legal. You can find the Most Wanted List [here]([URL] ||||| I would encourage you to come.  In general, I've found the Netrunner community to be pretty friendly.  Assuming you have a few games under the belt to avoid playing super slow, it should be fine.   So if you want to play in the tourny, get more play done before it starts. There are a few online ways to play, I prefer jinteki.net personally. ||||| [From the Netrunner Tournament Rules]([URL]  > Competitive events require players to have general knowledge of a game’s rules. While experienced players will come to these events to compete for prizes, players should not be punished for their lack of understanding in the finer points of Android: Netrunner rules. Players can come to these events expecting a consistent experience from store to store. This tier includes Store Championships and unique, one-off events such as the Chronos Protocol Tour.  So I say go for it! ||||| Feel 100 percent free to come.  In fact,  I encourage it. Just realize that if you do,  it will be a learning experience.   You will get your butt kicked.   You will make mistakes. You will learn a TON about netrunner and get a lot better and a lot of ideas really quickly.  You will meet a lot of awesome people.   But if you are disheartened by losing a lot,  don't go.   If youre not willing to play at a decent speed and just accept you'll make mistakes or bad decisions and sometimes lose because you're new and playing faster than you want,  don't go. If you want to agonize over every decision,  don't go.    I recommend going.   Go in with the right mindset, having a blast seeing some more competitive netrunner,  and take a lot from the experience.     Also,  they pair people by win/loss record,  so at the bigger events the last round always has a few really new players playing each other,  so it's not like you'll always be slamming your head against people who placed at world's.   Have a more experienced player check your decklist earlier in the week to make sure it's legal to the new mwl rules,  and bring your decklists to the event.   Nothing ruins a tournament faster than realizing you didn't bring a legal deck!  ||||| > I don't want to cause aggravation by playing slowly and probably asking several rules clarifications.  Here in NYC, every Store Champs I went to has had at least one person who it's been their first tournament, and everyone was very welcoming, at least in the ways that I saw. ||||| For a Store Champ, I would say go for it. Those events are usually still pretty casual. If it were a Regionals or Nationals event, I wouldn't recommend it. People travel pretty far for those events and a single slow opponent can sometimes destroy their chances at placing well.  Edit: just make sure you bring decklists and you're playing with legal decks (according to the Most Wanted List posted on the FFG website). ||||| Definitely enter. I've never seen anyone get annoyed by playing someone new. Just make sure your deck is legal so that you can make sure you play all the games you can. Playing a competitive game, letting them know you're new, and just seeing what other people are doing will help you make some friends in the community, and some directions to explore in deck building. No reason not to. ||||| If you can get a couple plays in before the tournament then go and sign up. If you haven't played at all please don't sign up for the tournament.  ||||| If you have not actually played before I strongly suggest that you go but not enter the tourney.  If they are using prestige ranking your getting killed all day could hurt your opponents standing in the end, also if your matches go to time it will hurt your opponents standing as well.  I suggest that you go, bring your decks and your lists, talk to the TO and I am sure there will be people there who would be happy to play with you.  A store championship is not the proper environment to learn the game in my opinion, but it can be a great place to find people to play with regularly so you can start competing soon. ||||| Go for it I say, and many others here by the looks of it. Being the local "community pusher"...hmm that sounds wrong...I can say having brand new players at tournaments is a GREAT thing. The netrunner community is VERY friendly so don't be afraid. If the games are over fast your opponent will most likely want to have a chat and talk about things anyway.  As for slow play. Don't worry about winning. Don't over think things. Plan ahead and just go on feel. Don't get too caught up with the result. Just play, if you make a run and it kills you...so what. Learn from it. Enjoy it. Be ready to go each turn, pay attention and the games will go to time. The more that show up now, the bigger the events will be later. Get stuck in and have fun ;) ||||| If you have literally never played a game, I would advise against entering. Maybe you can still get the promo by going and being involved. ||||| What kind of time limit are they running with? How experienced are you with the game?  Most tournaments should welcome all participants that at least know the game. Some rules questions shouldn't matter, as you're unlikely to ruin someone's chances in the tournament with that. ||||| I agree with "you should go".    With core only decks, you aren't likely to win, but seeing if you can nab a few games while meeting the community sounds like fun.  My first even ever was regionals (effectively a SC) in 2013, and I've played new players at store champs every year since.    Just out of curiosity, where are you?  I'm probably TOing the event in Danbury - always on the lookout for new players.   ||||| Heh, good thing I looked over the NAPD list.  I selected two decks from the New Player's Guide and it turns out the runner deck would be illegal.  5 cards out of the list of 11 are from the core set.  This is going to be a challenge. ||||| I went to my first tournament only a couple months after learning the game. I only had a single Core set and C&C. It was the experience that got me hooked on Netrunner.  I brought a decent Kate Atman/Parasite deck and the most atrocious NEXT Design you've ever seen. I got my butt kicked hard. It was the most fun I had ever had in board/card gaming. Everyone was very patient and nice, answering questions and reminding me of various upkeep (I'm terrible about Parasite tokens). I got my first promos there (A Chaos Theory ID, which just so happens to be my favorite Shaper). All around it was amazing.   I highly encourage you to give it a go. Also, if it's the Realms of Gaming Store Championship you are talking about, I will see you there and I'm bringing a couple newbie friends of my own :)  If you are looking for some strong core set only decks to bring, I highly recommend going to netrunnerdb.com and look for decks by a fellow named Trypios. He has some excellent builds on there that are very balanced and easy to pilot.  Have fun!  ||||| My first tournament was a store championship. Got crushed, but learned a lot.  ||||| I would say attend, with the caveat that if it's obvious you are going to time due to your slow play, concede the match...Oh wait FFG doesn't allow that. ||||| I'd say go, but try to get in a bunch of games online between now and then.  Various rule situations should come up, and you can get some questions answered.  Alternatively, you could watch a bunch of games on YouTube and probably learn some things. ||||| Most stores that hold tournaments have regular Netrunner nights. I'd recommend going to one of those before diving into tournaments. At my FLGS, a handful of us have single core only decks specifically to play beginners with.

An unexpected delay waiting around trying to be silent at the end of a hard 14 hour day when you'd really rather be getting shit put away and GTFO can be much more difficult than it might seem - and I'm sure can do much to turn other departments against sound on contentious sets (as I just saw happen this week).  I'm not looking for guesses, I want to hear from those that actually know for sure. ||||| Editor's call.  Should be specifically requested in specs at start of job.  If there is a sound that is intermittent or more present in some shots and less in others it may make sense.  That's the recordist's call.  A good editor should be able to find roomtone for a shot somewhere in the shots in the same location.  Whether he has time to do this depends on the schedule and budget.  There is a story about some junior editors getting a very haired, beyond competent mixer fired off of a long running episodic that was known for getting in closer to schedule than most for not recording room tone.  The scheduling just didn't allow for it, and post for whatever reason (maybe just to throw their weight around or to justify their looping budget) started sending emails to the right people and got their way.  I've been on both sides and find the lack of communication between post and production to be almost laughable (if it wasn't so pathetic.). Tons of wasted hours created by both sides for each other which could have been solved by a conference call with no egos involved.  The biggest culprit lately is spec sheets requesting contrary, impossible (camera does not support,) or flat out non-existant formats  ||||| I'm a re-recording mixer (used to be a dialog editor). Roomtone is normally useless. The ambient sound of a location changes from shot to shot, and even take to take. Plus by the time you call for room tone one or more of the actors might be off set. For any room tone/fill to work it needs to be recorded on ALL mics, not just the boom. Imagine asking Mel Gibson to just stand in the middle of a room so you can record his lav.  We have our editors create room tone from individual takes and mics by extracting the bits of tone from each angle. So 3-5 seconds of "silence" either before Action or Cut is the most helpful. Also, I remember when I was a production mixer... there was always that one grip who would quietly walk or put up a c stand during room tone. ||||| A director I work with always calls action as "AANNNDDDD................action"   The big pause to help sound get room tone, and the quiet action as to not startle anyone. It's also a very zen time. Not often do you have 30-50 people standing around being perfectly silent. ||||| The purpose of room tone is to bridge the dialog from one shot to the next, in scenarios where the noise floor would be noticeable at nominal dialog volume. Shooting room tone can be very helpful if, for example, there is a long break in the dialog during which non-diegetic sounds (sounds not appropriate for the world of the film, i.e. crew moving around, director calling cues, etc.) occur.  What isn't useful, generally speaking, is shooting room tone from a randomly selected single point in a given space. Imagine your ear is a boom microphone, listen to someone in a room from any given perspective. That perspective has specific acoustic attributes. Now, move to another perspective and you should notice that the attributes of the room from that new perspective have changed.  Shooting a scene where the mics are moving, the room tone to match that shot must be changing as well. Most dialog editors would tell you that the best fill comes from within a take. A small pause between words or phrases, duplicated and attached to the out-point of that take works best to transition from that shot to the next. And for the next shot, using the same procedure, but attaching the pause to the in-point of the shot gives you good fill for that side of the cut. Finally, fading the a-side of the cut out while fading the b-side of the cut in should give the aural illusion of a natural change in the acoustic perspective of the space.  A little anecdote: I worked with one of the boom ops from homeland, who told me that on that show, they ask for 5-10 seconds of tone at the top of shots after everyone is rolling, but before action is called. This intrigued me, though I have never put it into regular practice (I've found it to be a hard sell to antsy directors and ADs). ||||| >Is it's necessity a myth spread by film school and the inexperienced?  Yes and no. It was historically more critical, because editing analog audio was both more time consuming and also degraded the quality of the recording each time it was transferred/duped, or even just played back. The advent of digital audio makes it an easier and less time consuming process, and non-destructive, to grab a very short piece of tone from a take and loop it to fit your requirements.  It also used to be common on fully funded productions for the sound crew to go and record atmos tracks and spot fx without the rest of the crew in tow, scheduled entirely separately from the shoot. Obviously that costs more and wasn't viable on tight budgets.  Plus remote/online access to sound libraries makes the possibility of creating an artificial room tone more viable, whereas it used to mean getting your hands on a physical copy of stock recordings, or making your own, if that's the solution you chose to go with.  But there's different workflows and it may still suit a production to have a tone track. It's a communication that should be made ahead of time but some recordists may just do it by wrote anyway, depending on how they were taught. ||||| As a DX editor, I absolutely hate when I don't have room tone.  It's not a myth, and it's not a waste of time.  Creating my own tone out of gaps in speech sucks.    I just edited a short where some of my employees went out and did location sound, and they got room tone.  Great!    The project before that I was a million dollar feature where I had no room tone, and it sucked balls.  Moral of the story?  Always get room tone if you can, which isn't always possible when busy 1st ADs get involved.  ||||| I ask for world or room tone based on the environment we're shooting in. Generally speaking if we're shooting in a sounds friendly environment, I skip tone. If we're in a location with intermittent noise or one where it's changed for some reason (rain, crickets etc.) I might roll room tone to help post.. But EQ, noise reduction plug ins and ADR are all usually more effective at reducing or eliminating noise, etc. ||||| I've noticed a trend with my sound guy. stages no.  locations yes. Isolated locations maybe.
9367	1,3,3,3	4	Every now and then there is a post about RP, people wondering what it is, encouraging others to try it, sharing stories of Goldshire that put them off it forever...  Honestly, this part of the game is extremely fun. If you're bored with the content it is actually a great thing to try out, it can keep you entertained when quests, raiding and PvP just aren't enough!  So if you're like me and love the RP element of the game, no doubt you have had experiences that will stick with you for a long time. What are they? ||||| In my old guild we had a fantastic priest/mother/woman who would always come up with random and exciting things for us to do out of thin air. Most of them were short lived and random but quite fun, one event she organized, "The Healing of the Dead Scar." (Belves and Belf centric guild btw.) Had a huge turnout, many other Belf groups and even other players came to the event and a forum post was created of the event and such it was pretty cool.   I guess in the end this story isn't that cool but it was enjoyable for myself and most people involved. RP realms usually have tight knit communities which is awesome when everyone is getting along, just be careful, sometimes you will get little cliques that form, usually some mean girl and her henchman who want to have sex with her, or suck up to her because she is popular. It's kinda like high school.  Take the good with the bad, enjoy the game, make your character your own, regardless of what others say, and ultimately have fun with people you enjoy! ||||| My blood elf worked as a bartender in Falconwing Square, the little park just in the ruins of Silvermoon. Every day we would have more and new people show up, and it was the most fun I've ever had in WoW... The grand opening was the largest RP event I've ever seen.  Unfortunately the guild's moved on, but I'm never going to forget how much fun it was being in such an active and friendly community. If anyone here recognizes this guild on Wyrmrest Accord, give me a shout!  ||||| I recall a special little encounter that happened right after I joined an RP Guild on MoonGuard a few weeks ago. A Human Death Knight approached me, my new Guild Leader, and a Guildmate (all of us Dwarves) for a favor, and I made some sort of In-Character wisecrack along the lines of "if ye want my soul get in line". My fellow Dwarves laughed...  ...And this woman got **PISSED**. She went on a tirade about how insensitive I was about the soul she no longer had. (It was "ripped from her") The anguish she expressed I could only compare to a rape victim after someone made a rape joke. She made me feel like a royal asshole and I was hella nervous, In-Character *and* out. I tried to beat around the bush, stand my ground, 'cause that's how I felt the Dwarf would react. She eventually left in a huff, and I apologized to my Guild Master that I'd already made him some enemies.  It wasn't a pleasant experience, but *hot damn*, it was highly entertaining. I never did get to find out what she originally wanted. Sometimes being a douche causes that. It was a sobering, but very valuable, moment in RP for me.   I remember another moment. I was role-playing a "Grave Digger" Draenei. This "Alterac" Worgen was talking to an ally of his in Stormwind's Graveyard, and I just happened to be nearby. He eventually turned his attention to me, questioned the odd circumstances of my character, and I was already prepared with her story. I was *not* prepared to actually show him around my "workplace", but he asked and I delivered. I showed him the grave of a prominent Alterac member who died during the First War, and he was humbled and thankful. It was overall pleasant and I learned more about my character and how she should work.

9156	1,1,3,3,1,2,3,3,3,1,0	19	Hi everyone,   As this is a 'sister' festival to the wonderful Bonnaroo, I would hope that we would also partake in the wonderful concept of 'radiate positivity'. I've been to Bonnaroo twice before and I believe that is what makes Bonnaroo so great, you don't have a bunch of hot heads in a pissing contest, you just have people who are happy to be in one place and listen to great music. I think that should also be a mantra for this subreddit, I mean take a stroll over to r/Bonnaroo and everyone embodies that in each post and comment, this sub is new and seems to need some guidance. I was born and raised in Oro-Medonte, like my father and his father and his father and so on. I wasn't old enough to attend live aid, or the other concerts that made Molson park famous, and put Barrie and surrounding area on the map, but I certainly hope that Burl's creek has a better fortune than that.   Tl;Dr be happy for this wicked event and try to let everyone else enjoy it in their own way.   ||||| This guy gets it! While I haven't been to Roo, as an electric forest veteran I'll be brining the positive in all my posts and all interactions at the festival :) ||||| I posted this in the roo subreddit! 100% agree - highfives, WAYHOMEEEEE!!! shouts, beers with camp neighbours, + everything you need! and hopefully they have SPICY PIE ||||| I've only ever participated in /r/bonnaroo and branching out has been a sad awakening to the real internet. Hopefully the good can conquer the bad here at /r/wayhome. ||||| Totally agree and will promote/support/love all positive vibes on this sub ||||| Can you sticky things on Reddit? If so, I think this should be stickied or at least re-posted every now and then. I haven't been to a festival before but I've heard that the environment can sometimes make or break the festival. Hopefully everyone will follow this and make WayHome even more amazing than it already will be. ||||| Amen! ||||| Well said.   Aside from the heat, 'roo is one of the best places I've been. Live music and happy people.  ||||| This was the only concern I had coming into this festival. I knew we were in good hands with the organizers coming from Bonnaroo, but the attitude and overall feel is what's going to make it or break it for me. High fives all around!!! ||||| I agree! ||||| I think the whole bonnaroo connection is being played up a bit too much.  Its fair to say that this is a sister festival to boots and hearts, but not bonnaroo.  Superfly, not AC, is really the entity behind the culture and identity of bonnaroo. 
6665	1,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2	34	I've been thinking about this as a career choice and was wondering what it's like, and how the road to becoming one was. ||||| I am an army nurse. What did you want to know exactly? In terms of how the road is to becoming one, theres a few different paths you can take. I did ROTC right out of high school, got my BSN,and commissioned active duty, so I know a lot about that path in particular. Its a bit different if you pay for school on your own, and its a LOT different if you go the LPN route. Also, the active army does not accept ADNs.   In terms of what its like? I guess its essentially just like being a civilian nurse except you're expected to meet the army standards. You won't have organized PT sessions like 99% of all other soldiers, but you will be expected to take and pass a PT test (which includes ht/wt) every 6 months. You will also be expected to perform the basic soldier skills, like qualifying with a weapon, once a year (though, its my understanding that the army can be quite lenient on the soldier skills for people in the medical field). Also you will live where the army tells you to live, and sometimes that can really, REALLY suck. There are army bases in some pretty shitty places. And, of course, theres always the potential for you to deploy.   The career path is quite different in the army. Once you make CPT, you will start moving into leadership positions unless you become a nurse practitioner, or CRNA, etc. The army really is all about leadership, so once you make CPT, don't expect to be doing to much more bedside work--you'll be put into management positions. If that's not your gig, you can always just get out when your contracts up.  In terms of the actual medical care...well, that really depends on the hospital you get assigned to. Some are great hospitals, some not so much. The army has a lot of very small, very limited hospitals, and quite a lot of people aren't very happy when they end up assigned to those hospitals. In terms of patient population, this is going to change a lot depending on where you're at also. In my opinion, you tend to see more surgical than medical (especially at the small hospitals) because your patient population is generally young, fit, and healthy. If you happen to have a large veteran population nearby, however, you could potentially have a lot of geriatrics.   Three big problems I've seen at every army hospital:  1. Because your patient population knows their medical care is free, your ER will always be slammed with people there for stupid shit  2. The physicians admit people that should not be admitted all the freaking time  3. Dealing with the spouses is a lot, LOT worse than dealing with the soldiers  Theres a lot more I could say about this. If you could be more specific about what you want to know, I'd be happy to give you some more info. ||||| Navy Nurse here. Can confirm essentially the same thing as /u/MaybeMoustache. Pros: the opportunity to travel the world and advance as a nurse (or advance in leadership nursing), potential for graduate school to be funded by the military. Cons: no overtime, year round military training not related to nursing (staying after work or coming in on days off with no payback), patient/nurse ratios are more guidelines than rules, potential middle of nowhere duty station. I could also add go on for days. Rock on military nurses! ||||| I have looked in to military nursing mostly because they have the highest rated CRNA schools in the nation. From what I've learned and experienced as a civilian contractor working with the military hospitals I can only echo what has already been stated here but also include that the military demands payment for your training. Getting in to a military CRNA school is supremely not guaranteed no matter what that recruiter tells you. I'll also echo you go where you are told; period. When I was in germany everyone was GLAD to be there because it was like famous middle ground. You were either in the states, germany or turkey, or in a tent in a sand pit. Point being, you were where you were told you would be. That was several years ago IDK what it's like now. I wouldn't do a civilian contract for the states now if it was paid upfront. But I will say I did enjoy my coworkers. They treated me well and it was one of the best experiences I've had as a nurse except for the difficulties getting paid appropriately; which was extensive. Yet in the end, I eventually, got paid VERY WELL (as a civilian). One of the most famous quotes I got from my military counterparts was that for the amount of time they worked they'd have been better off working at McDonald's. But IDK about that to be honest. As a civilian I got paid well but the shit I had to go trough, bureaucratically, made me vow to never do it again.  ||||| What specific questions did you have? ||||| I was told by a recruiter that it was difficult and unlikely that a nurse would get deployed. She said that she had been asking for deployment for many years (as have many) but she hasn't been, yet. In your experience, is that true? ||||| RN or LPN? ||||| Out of curiosity, what would my LVN be good for in the military. I used to fly drones for the Army, thought about going back in with my LVN, or getting my ADN (happening whether I go in again or not) and trying to bridge through the Army to my BSN.  Main question though is what is my LVN worth in the military? ||||| I've always been curious about AD nursing practice overseas. How do you or how does your unit get chosen to go overseas. How would nursing practice and responsibilities change if you were assigned to a hospital like at Kandahar or camp bastion (UK). As a military nurse how likely is it to end up in some of these combat zones? The way military nurses are portrayed in the media make it seem like you're all at deployed at forward hospitals but obviously that is incorrect. 
5952	1,3,3,3	7	Hi,  What is the biggest problem about rankeds? The champion select. I'm sure you saw the [Im tridanemer]([URL] post and a lot of similiar ones.  Oftentimes people type bad english and insist on picking a certain champion (which often is a carry-type champion) saying they're really good with it and always win.   These situations are quite complicated because usually when someone types bad english and only knows how to play one champion, you get sceptical wether he really is good or not. And if it's a carry role he wants, his performance will have a big impact on your chances of winning.  So what I suggest is; Being able to check teammates Ranked Stats in champion select, so if someone goes "let my ad plz i very good tnx" you can easily click on his name to bring up his ranked stats which in turn shows that the person has mostly played AD carries in rankeds and has a 65% win ratio on Caitlyn so you can trust him and give him the role he wants. I believe such feature would be an enormous help and would most definitely make the arguing in champion select more meaningful because everyone can see everyones ranked stats so you can't lie about your win ratio on certain champions.   Sorry if this post is a little messy and came out a little too long, I just woke up a moment ago.  **TL;DR:** Make it possible to check your teammates ranked stats/profile in champion select. ||||| Now that i read this i think that alt-tab to check leagueofstats could help a little in some matches. ||||| I support this feature 100%. Getting to see the stats of some ass who says they're a good tank with singed and see that he has a 2% win ratio with him would really help. ||||| They should put this feature into the game period, regardless of normal or ranked. 
9154	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2	20	Ordering one t-shirt is expensive... but if we team up together and order like 20+ at a time, shipping price will seem cheaper. Of course, the price would be at-cost, so that way every redditor benefits the greatest.  So, we either mass buy from the official reddit [store]([URL] and pay for shipping & try to negotiate a group deal, or if the reddit logo is not trademarked, etc., we can have a clothing company like Gildan to make some sweaters or simple t-shirts.

I also refuse to roll them @ 3 HEDT per one mod, when gear costs the same and you can reroll a stat with PC.

7044	1,3,3,3,3,3	7	Is it "OK" if I use my vision insurance to buy a glasses frame for somebody else? Or would that be considered some sort of insurance fraud? ||||| Definitely fraud. ||||| Yes, it's fraud. Your insurance is to cover *you*. *Your* health, *your* glasses. You can get into big trouble if you would do this. Thus, I wouldn't do it.  ||||| How exactly would you get glasses for them, unless they happened to have exactly the same prescription as you? I suppose you could get two sets of glasses, one for yourself and one for them. But most insurance only covers one new set per year, so you would pay out of pocket for the exam and glasses... they might as well just get their own. ||||| It would be insurance fraud. Eye exams and glasses are not that expensive compared to other healthcare costs. I recommend going to America's Best. They have the commercials for 2 pairs of glasses plus an eye exam for $69.99 (at least it was that last time I went, maybe the price has changed). The first time I went, I thought it would be a scam or the frames to choose from would be awful, it really wasn't anything like that. I got two frames I really liked and paid the $70 plus tax. I think they are quite reasonable there and have a great selection of frames covered by that two pair deal. Plus if you want to upgrade either frame to a nicer one, opt for improved lenses or choose a pair to be sunglasses, they allow you to just add that onto the two pair deal, it's just an up charge rather than full cost with the deal being void. Paying $70-$80 for an eye exam and two pairs of glasses is much better than the possible consequences of committing insurance fraud.  ||||| Try buying your glasses online instead. They are much cheaper. You will need to know the Rx and pupillary distance. This is the distance in millimeters between the two eyes' pupils. You can measure this yourself with a tape measure or ask the Dr. for it with your Rx.  A few sites to consider:  eyebuydirect.com  39dollarglasses.com   There is a whole racket going on in the eyeglasses/contacts business. An Italian company called Luxottica owns pretty much all designer brand glasses frames like Ray Ban. The markup on these frames is ridiculous. $400 glasses should not even exist. Many doctor's offices must keep these inflated prices or Luxottica will not allow them to sell any of their products. A good number of vision insurance companies are owned by Luxottica and control what will be paid for the frames (usually it's just enough to annoy people but they will suck it up and pay the rest anyway). Some of the more well-known retail eyeglass and sunglass shops are owned by Luxottica (like LensCrafters, Sears Optical, Target Optical, Pearle Vision, Sunglass Hut) and only stock their products.  I choose not to support this awful business. Buy online, avoid insurance, and save a bunch of money.
6004	1,3,3,3	6	I'm just wondering what the Reddit's opinion might be regarding the placement of import lines.  Specifically I'm talking about this:      # start of file     import re     ...          class Something(object):         ...         def x(self):             regex = re.compile(r"whatever")             ...      class SomethingElse(object):         ...          ...   vs say, something like this:      # start of file          class Something(object):         ...         def x(self):             import re             regex = re.compile(r"whatever")             ...      class SomethingElse(object):         ...          ...  Is there any substantial penalty involved in importing `re` inside the `x()` method?  What if `x()` is called 1000 times? ||||| There is a penalty, it isn't in itself substantial because the module is only compiled and executed on the first import. Subsequent imports just do a look-up and bind in the function scope, which is relatively quick.  But don't do it unless you really need to, say if you are working around a circular dependency and can't reorganize your code.  And in general if you have code that gets called frequently then you should move anything that needs only a one-time computation outside the code. In your example, as well as moving the import to the module scope, it may be a good idea to move the `re.compile()` to the class or module scope (assuming it is always the same pattern). ||||| Yes there is. Not only does it violate PEP8 and makes your code a bit non-standard Python has to reload the re module every time you call X vs just once when loading your module. ||||| I believe it's 15 yards from the spot of the foul and an automatic first down.  If it's in the last two minutes of a half, it's an automatic 15 second runoff of the clock.
8524	1,3,3	7	I had some MP3s and I converted them to WAVs then tried to burn them onto a CD but it didn't work. So I looked, and it seems I have the wrong bit rate or something (fairly illiterate when it comes to stuff like this) and I need to convert the WAV file to one with the correct bit rate or kHz or something. However, I cannot find any programs or guides for this sort of thing.  Edit: I have CD-RW's [](/solved) ||||| First, a word of warning, not all CD players will read CD-RWs.  The CD player in question will also matter since newer players can read/play mp3 files, but since you are trying to convert them I will just go with it is an old/limited CD player that doesn't play mp3s.  Okay, onto burning. It can depend on what software you are using, but in most cases the program will do the work of converting the songs from mp3 to the appropriate WAV configuration. If you are using a particular program, let me know, but for most of my light burning (it has been a while since I have actually burned a disc), I use the free version of [Ashampoo Burning Studio 6]([URL]  To burn a music CD using this program you:  1. Start the program (this assumes you have downloaded and installed it first) 2. Select the "Burn or Rip Music" category 3. Select the "Create an Audio CD" option (description: can be played on normal CD players) 4. Click the "Add" button in the upper right 5. Navigate to your mp3s 6. double-click or click+add your songs to add them to the CD. You will notice the timer on the bottom fill blue for the amount of CD you are using (it depends on the disc, but it should be limited to about 80 minutes of music. If you go over that time allotment then it will go into the red, but it will warn you about this and won't allow you to proceed. 7. when you have the disc in order, click Next 8. Select the CD Writer drive, put in your blank disc and...well, sorry, I am at work and don't have access to blanks to "test" the remainder, but look at the "change options" and set the speed to something less than full speed. 9. Click Write 10. Wait while it burns (a couple of minutes, depends on burn speed) 11. Test the disc in the CD player.  Most burning programs will follow a similar pattern of how to do this, this is just the one I use and had in front of me to write the guide.  Some will either allow you to edit the track information or will simply pull the information for the ID3 tag - this information can be read by some CD players and will be the displayed text while the song is playing - so if it looks weird on the CD player, this may be the reason. ||||| [URL]  At least attempt to search google first.

174	1,3,3,3	9	I have about 6 zucchini bushes that have quite a few flowers on them. I remember growing up my mother used to stuff them, bread them and fry them and I'd like to do that, but I'm growing a garden for myself and my friends to take from and I don't want to harm the harvest. Anyone have any advice? ||||| If you pick the flower, you're essentially picking the unborn zucchini. The plants will keep flowering throughout the summer, but you won't get any zucchini if you keep picking the flowers. ||||| I want to carlify a little about what /u/Pitta_ said.    There are boy zucchini flowers and girl zucchini flowers.  (I think).  At any rate some flowers are on stems; others are on the end of fruit.  See [this photo]([URL] for an example.  You can pick off either and go to town.  The ones on stems won't turn into fruit; taking the flower off the fruit won't hurt the fruit - just let the flower(s) get big enough to make sure you're not picking off fruit with it.    Zucchini flowers are delicious; have fun! ||||| My experience is that once the fruit starts the flower goes away. Do you have fruit with flowers on them?
2873	1,2,3,3	8	Sometimes I vaporize Scutellaria lateriflora to ease the onset of WD symptoms. Here's something from Wikipedia:  "A number of the flavones found in S. lateriflora have been reported to selectively bind with high affinity to central benzodiazepine receptor sites, leading to the view that the flavones exert anxiolytic and other benzodiazepine effects in rats."  It was always marginally helpful in this regard. It also usually seems to enhance benzo effects for me personally. I vaporize it with my Vapor Genie. Tea works too. I'm sure people are aware of this, but I thought I'd make a post for those who never heard of it. Works better than valerian for me when desperate. I call it benzo lettuce. ||||| I have never heard of this before so now im intrigued... Do you vaporize the flower or the leaf? Do you dry it or vape it fresh picked? Does it grow pretty commonly? I only ask because I feel like I've seen them everywhere and I really want to try this as im gonna be hitting some pretty bad WDs soon and any thing that is legal and will help sounds great ||||| That is very interesting. I'm definitely going to try this once I have a vaporizer of my own. ||||| If they bind at benzodiazepine sites then potentially they down regulate gaba-a receptor. Or is it the case that there are other sites that benzodiazepines bind to that are not only gaba-a? If so this could be a very useful tool for withdrawal or an anxiolytic agent on its own.  I wonder exactly what "binding at benzodiazepaine sites" means exactly.  I found something interesting here: [URL]  "An in vivo behavioural test measuring the anxiolytic responses in rats administered aqueous extracts of skullcap showed a significant difference between treated and control rats (n=21, p<0.05) (17). In vitro aqueous extracts of skullcap induced release of [3H] GABA in rat brain synaptosomes. Inhibition of GABA reuptake in cells explains the in vivo mechanism by which skullcap has an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission (17). In vitro studies with baicalin and the aglycone baicalein from Scutellaria baicalensis demonstrate binding with high affinity to the benzodiazepine site of GABAA, contributing to the anxiolytic properties (17). The discovery of relatively high quantities of serotonin in skullcap may explain the in vitro study, which found that skullcap extracts bind to the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor "

7427	1,3,3	4	So I am an international student from Sweden going for a Bachelor degree in nursing. I am currently going for my pre-reqs to later transfer in to a university. In a year (between my associate and beginning my bachelor) I have the possibility to work for a year with something that has to do with nursing.   Since I don't have any certification.. what am I legally permitted to do? Back in Sweden I worked as an uncertified nurse assistant (which means I could only work at nursing homes, I could hand out medicine with the exception for insulin).   Oh, I live in Washington state.  Thank you.  ||||| I don't know a whole lot about US laws, but in Canada (which I'm sure is quite different anyways) you are extremely limited in what you can do. In Alberta's Chinook Health Region the lowest current classification is a Personal Care Aide and their scope includes all personal care such as toileting, bathing, feeding etc, but does not include any wound management or medication or anything like that. I imagine it will be REASONABLY similar in the US. I know some facilities have their own guidelines allowing medication administration from blister packs, but in the end I would expect to be quite limited. ||||| I would recommend going for your Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) if you'd like to get into the nursing-ish field before or while you're at school. The vast majority of colleges and quite a few branches of the red cross offer various length courses that prepare you to take the exam to become a CNA. They are generally a semester at the longest, some as short as a few weeks. Some nursing programs actually require you to have your CNA as a pre-req for their RN programs, but it depends on the school of course.

8784	1,3,2,3,3	8	I purchased a cell phone December 2012 at futureshop and I purchased the extended warranty through futureshop.  The warranty was such that if my phone broke in anyway that was not due to physical damage they would replace it on the spot for free with the latest model phone in the same price bracket as my current phone.  I've noticed that 6 months ago my credit card statement has changed from futureshop billing me for this warranty to geek squad billing me.  The geek squad warranty is crap and requires that I send the phone away and get a refurbished phone of the same kind as my current model.  Can they legally change my warranty like this without notice,  I would never have bought the warranty if I knew my phone had to be sent away and I could go weeks without a cellphone. I am on the old 3 year contract if this makes a difference. ||||| As someone who used to work at future shop, they consider warranties as "contracts" of sorts, they cannot be changed on you.  However, it looks like they've recently changed all warranty services to be from geek squad dimply by name.  The terms and coverage from the warranty you purchased would remain the same. ||||| You're paying an ongoing fee for a phone warranty? ||||| Before anyone jumps down my neck about how silly these are, I would normally not get a warranty but the phone I originally bought had broke within 2 days of me owning it, and after some research I found out there was a lot of issues with that model.  I have used the warranty twice already to replace my phone so it has come in handy.  ||||| Currently work at Future Shop. Your contract does not change, just pop into a store and so long as your billing is paid up, they will do an exchange for a new phone. However any new warranties are now the Geek Squad plan, and unfortunately don't go through the store level. 
4089	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3	16	I want to visit/maybe move to Switzerland in about 5 years, and I wanted to know if I should just learn German and then Swiss German, because I've heard that the Swiss German is very different from Standard German.  Also, another thing: How do I keep myself motivated when learning online?  This has been a major problem with me and learning Swedish, because I just feel like the words aren't staying, no matter what memorization technique I use, and I don't want that to happen with German too.  Anyways, thanks in advance for answering, and I hope you have a nice day. ||||| Swiss people will understand standard German. A lot of Germans and Austrians will have no clue what you are saying and suppress laughter if you speak Swiss German to them. So I would say just learn standard and then go from there. ||||| Generally, I'd say your best bet is to learn the language you want to learn.   Swiss German is indeed quite different from standard German and if Swiss is what you want to learn, learning German first will only marginally help with that. A decent book I've found (and basically the only one) for learning Swiss is [this one]([URL] The only thing is the method of instruction is standard German.   I would bet that the majority of learning material for Swiss is going to be from German, so that will make learning Swiss difficult.  There's also the problem that Swiss German isn't really a written language, so it's going to be difficult to find that kind of useful material as well.   There are some [resources here]([URL] but not all the links still work.  There's also the issue of every major area having its own dialect of Swiss German. Of course, those are generally going to be closer to each other than to Standard German.  On the other hand, if you go with standard German, there are tons of resources, tons of native materials, tons of movies and music, and probably more than you can ever use. On top of that, most people that you're going to end up speaking with in Swizterland will already know High German and you can use that while having them also teach you Swiss German when you're there.  **tl;dr Swiss German is very different from Standard German but lacks the necessary resources for you to really be able learn much of it. But if your heart is set on learning Swiss, go for it.**    ||||| I'd say learn them both at the same time. This may be hard, but by learning the differences between related languages, you cement your memory of them. Also, whereas you're able to count on lots of resources for Standard German, you will likely have to make your own for Swiss German, which will really really help you. Also it gives you a backup - if you really aren't motivated to learn German one day, you can mess around with Swiss German. Check message boards and comments sections of SG newspapers for online exposure to language, also youtube for videoblogs. Consider it as your secondary or backchannel education - i.e. all the stuff you learn in school outside of the classroom, where you learn from friends and become a teacher the moment you know something cool.  My friend lives in a squat in Zurich, and her 'awful' German is awesome and really impresses people in Berlin. Similarly, I was seeing a girl from Austria, and while I don't understand German I understand the difference between her cute-as-fuck family dialect and the boring standard German she speaks with academic friends. ||||| Your problem with motivation actually presents the strongest argument for learning Standard German first. Standard German has a big community of learners and speakers, as well as tons of online and print resources. Trying to bypass Standard German will only make your motivation problems worse as you get frustrated with the lack of resources.  Also, the best advice I can give you is to get involved with OFFLINE resources for your target language, like clubs and meetups. This more than anything will keep you motivated when you are using online resources - by themselves, online tools aren't enough for a lot of people. If you have a little extra money, paying a tutor for weekly lessons might help with motivation too (partially because the financial commitment tends to be a good motivator), but it isn't strictly necessary.  As a last note, the absolute best way to learn a target language is to date native speakers of that language. This would actually be the most effective way of learning Swiss German. But I realize this isn't always realistic, feasible, or even desirable. ||||| Learn Standard (Hochdeutsch) first, then just learn how the Swiss pronounce words + words the Swiss use but not the rest of Germans and tada, you now speak Deutsch and Dütsch  Edit: The Swiss have a few different grammar rules, so you might want to learn those too ||||| As many have mentioned, Swiss-German is effectively a spoken dialect. If you were going to just visit for a short while, I would just learn German.   However, if you really are interested in moving to Switzerland, there's a couple things to know that can possibly help you get where you want to be.  Firstly, [English tends to be the unofficial lingua franca of Switzerland.]([URL] You'd be surprised how far "Entschuldigen Sie! Sprechen Sie Englisch?" can get you in german speaking areas, especially with people 30 and younger. That's not to say you should abandon German all together! But in a pinch, it's definitely worth a shot.  Secondly, most courses that teach Swiss-German do so from High-German. That can be unnerving at first, but might not be as big a deal as you would think. After all, with so many English speaking Swiss, I'm sure there are plenty of courses that can help bridge the gap. If you are truly serious about learning the dialect, learn as much German as you can now and then schedule classes once you move to Switzerland. [If it helps at all, here's a link to the ETH Zurich page on learning German and Swiss German.]([URL]  Finally, and more so for your reference, Swiss German is not actually a unified language, but rather a group of similar Alemanic Dialects and can vary depending on location. For funsies, [this map]([URL] actually shows how it is distributed. I bring this up to really stress my second point on learning the dialect once you get there. Reason being, you'll learn the dialect best suited for your location.   Anyway, I hope this helps! ||||| It's the same deal in Arabic. Tried to learn some Arabic before moving, and then discovered that Egyptian Arabic is different enough that studying MSA was pretty pointless. (Yes yes, I knew they were different, but I didn't know HOW different.   Point: learn the spoken dialect, fill in the gaps and familiarize yourself with the differences when you're there.  ||||| The thing about learning Swiss German... does anybody actually teach it? ||||| Ive always been very dissapointed that Duolingo doesn´t allow for the selecting of different dialects of a language. I plan on working of French this summer, and I also want to specifically learn the Swiss variant. When I speak spanish, I speak like a spaniard. No Uds. if I don´t have to.
6301	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	37	Hi Maryland! My husband and I would like to move out of Tampa, and are thinking Maryland might be ideal. We would prefer to live somewhere that has less oppressive summer and is more walkable and has good public transportation. We like MD's proximity via train to NY and DC. But we really don't know anything about the different areas of MD.     We have an infant, and would like to be somewhere safe first and foremost. We want to live somewhere where we could easily walk to the ~~metro~~ MARC/public train, grocery store, and eateries. Walkable to museums, parks, etc, would be nice but we don't mind taking the train to get to those things. We could live anywhere in the state that fits the bill, in an apartment building, or condo/townhouse or single family home. We can afford a $1300 per month or $220,000 home (maybe a little more, but this is what we are paying now), and would consider renting or buying. Is this possible? If so what areas? Thank you in advance!          ETA: We both telecommute, so job location is not a factor for us. Changed metro to MARC. ||||| Cheap, walkable, safe, near public transit... not a whole lot comes to mind to be honest. Owings Mills has a fair number of apartments available in that range and is one of the few places that is metro accessible, but isn't really walkable for daily errands. A lot of the trendier places like Hampden, Fells, Fed Hill, or Canton that are more walkable are increasing in rent and the safety is debatable. Hampden is considered one of the safer neighborhoods, but my house was just broken into earlier this week and they stole a 40" TV.   Over in the Lauraville/Hamilton area there are lots of houses for sale around the $200k mark that have been recently rehabbed. Walkability is a mix depending on how far out from the main roads you go, but the neighborhoods are generally fine (I think.) ||||| I don't know that it's possible to get *all* of that.  Safe, walkable, cheap... pick two. I chose safe and cheap(er. Nothing here is cheap, haha.) and also work from home. Regardless of the stereotypes people seem to hold against them despite changing demographics, Pasadena, parts of Glen Burnie, etc. are a safe and affordable location. But they are not near Metro by any means. You could get on the Penn line Marc and ride down to Union Station. That's what we do. ||||| Also summers are hell here... Very humid. ||||| I live in Adelphi (part of Hyattsville, close to Montgomery County) and I absolutely love my home. I got great neighbors and a huge yard, walking distance to Safeway and the local Hispanic market. We got ridiculously lucky to buy a 5br home because it foreclosured at 180k. I know it probably isn't in your list because you have an infant, and we have made lots of improvements to the house.  Unfortunately, most nicer areas are very pricey. Houses around my neighborhood are in the 300-400s. We do have great transportation as I commute to my university (Howard in DC) and about 3 miles away from UMD. It is a great neighborhood. I wish you luck in finding a home! ||||| Check out Brunswick, MD for price range and proximity to MARC train. But keep in mind the local economy is shit, so there's no nice stores or eateries.  ||||| Germantown? Accessible to both DC and Baltimore. Probably cheaper than Rockville/Bethesda.  Fredrick is a nice little city close to outdoors stuff (and Volt....yum).  Parts of Rockville  and Silver Spring are a bit cheaper I think, and you can always go out to Clarksburg which is about halfway between DC and Fredrick. ||||| I would consider Frederick, Laurel and Savage. ||||| Ferndale in Glen Burnie is almost walkable, nearly in your price range, and relativity safe. The local school system isn't bad. ||||| You're looking in the wrong state if you're trying to get away from oppressive heat....lol. ||||| In that price range you're going to want to look at a condo. Part of the problem is that there are enough things that keep the prices up its hard to really "get away". Even in Frederick many of the houses are going to be over 300k. BRAC has pushed up prices near Laurel and Odenton but both have MARC access and probably good Condo options. Bowie is a short drive to MARC and Metro and might work. If you're ok with a little more suburban/rural you could look at Waldorf in Charles Co. Much of it is a planned community and has hopes of getting some sort of bus it rail transit to the end of Metro in the next 15 ish years. As someone else pointed out Severna Park is safe and should have something affordable but is pretty suburban. Hyattsville may be a good bet if you get in now. Prices there are already on the rise but with the newer stuff there may be something that needs a little TLC. B'more (and suburbs) is an option as well but most of the safer neighborhoods aren't walkable. You could also look at Columbia. Another planned community. You might be able to get an older condo in that price range.   (If you really are looking to uproot and want good house value, go to upstate NY. Most of the cities and villages are walkable, most are safe, and you can get a huge house. Most schools are pretty good. Biggest issue of course is winter! But Rochester area and Ithaca among others are both quite up and coming. I have also heard similar things about Cleveland.) ||||| 200k and a nice neighborhood just isn't baltimore. The only area I would consider walkable in baltimore is homewood and surrounding areas up and down Charles st but you aren't finding anything for 200k there.  You might be able to find something in lower pa for that price ||||| [deleted]
7997	1,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3	12	[deleted] ||||| Well, the answer to your predicament lies in your statement itself. I used to be a lot like you (well I still am...kind of)  , with all those negative thoughts flowing through my head. What I do is I keep telling myself each day that I'm awesome , the King of the World and the world is in the palm of my hand.  It's amazingly easy to convince yourself that you suck or are awesome. For now , each day you wake up , face a mirror and tell yourself "I am awesome. I'm a great human being. There is nothing I Cannot do if I put my mind to it". You just need to do this kind of self-motivation on a regular basis to keep your chin up.  For what it's worth, I think you're quite brave for admitting that you have a problem. A true loser would just keep it in and waste away his life without ever confiding in someone. You sir have just taken the first step towards taking your life better , and you should pat yourself on the back... or I will  *Pats you on the back*  Edited for Typo ||||| The "Im Awesome" Technique is exactly what worked for me. At first I was told to look in a mirror and, man I hated it. I had no conviction on my face when I said it. I didn't believe it, so why was I telling myself this?  But eventually I took the practice outside of the bathroom, away from a mirror, and into the real world. I started calling myself champion. "I throw spears!" I talked myself up and became my own friend. I got to know why I liked myself, and made hanging out with myself a fun, regular thing. And that made all the difference.   Find out what you like hearing, and tell it to yourself ALL THE TIME. I loved hearing that I throw spears. I don't know why, but it made me feel so good about myself. Any time any little thing went right, I talked myself up. I told myself I was a champion. I throw spears.  You do too.    ||||| Are you asking for advice or trying to solicit sympathy?  If the second you have it, my friend. Social anxiety is a debilitating problem that colors nearly every other facet of your existence.

My main problem isn't as much as not knowing that I'm great but just knowing what's wrong with me according to other people. Whether it be because I'm annoying, look weak etc. I guess I'm trying to hard to at least feel accepted by everyone. ||||| May I suggest outing yourself? Once my close friends were aware and comfortable with my disability, I started playing a game. I first saw it in the last book of The Hunger Games Trilogy. It's called "real or not". I expressed my feelings and impression of other's reactions and asked the people who knew me best "real or not?"  I ask cause I don't know, and the judgement of "normal" people makes it easier for me.  ||||| We live in a society where one's social ability is used as a criteria for self worth. If all you're focused on is how other people react to you, you've allowed yourself to become their bitch.  You should give yourself a vacation from your social anxiety by embracing it. You have social anxiety, no big deal, so do plenty of other people. Focus on what you're good at for awhile. When you feel better about yourself, you won't feel so pressured in social situations and will have much better interactions

1279	1,3	4	I really appreciate it man! It is a game I've been wanting to play since I got a PCS! Happy New Year! ||||| Great game, its the more harcore version of CS GO.
7298	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	8	Hello folks!  I've gone from 360 to 280 this year and feel really good about it but what makes me smile is the roll back in time, though I'm still 56-57 years old certainly don't feel it anymore!  So here's the pics: Before and a month or so ago... [URL]  And tonight: Sorry about the smug look... [URL]  /r/keto for the science, /r/progresspics for the motivation and /r/loseit to tie it all together, you ALL are great and I thank YOU!   Edit, lol, forgot a bunch of stuff: I started keto 01/02/13, started walking in March, then Bike riding in April, stopped chewing tobacco the following month and nicotine gum three weeks later, then got a big ol, rubber band and a couple of dumbbells three weeks ago. Ha, a lot of work to go but for the first time in a long time I believe I will do it! ||||| Nice man, so no gym huh? ||||| Congratulations...that's a lot of changes to make! Great job. ||||| Last pic makes you look like a lumberjack. Nice work. ||||| [empty] ||||| You look like a BAMF. ||||| Fuck yeah! Good shit bro, nice efforts. Keep that shit up!
1028	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	22	I think the coolest way they could go about the new doom would be if they did it open world. You wake up in a military base after the demons have attacked earth from a coma or whatever. You search for weapons in buildings across L.A for guns and level up. The shooting would be a bit like rage and fallout. What do you guys think?     ||||| IMO I think I wouldn't like it.   I'd prefer an "old school shooter" with Episodes, Missions alot of Enemies and hidden Secrets. ||||| I think they need to just get back to the basics like Doom and Doom II.  ||||| I think if it's going to be open-world, it's gotta REALLY be open world.  Biggest problem for me with Doom 3 was it felt like it was too ...on rails?  With Doom and Doom 2, there was a much greater "open" feeling, especially on certain maps.  I think that they should either stick with what worked and go level-to-level with a slight theme (maybe even stick with 3 episodes), or keep the feel the same as the original and make it more open exploration.  But none of this "checkpoint" shit.  You die, you start the level over. ||||| Id prefer white knuckle action like the old dooms  ||||| Wow no. I'm sick of these "sandbox open box" games. Even worse if they are "procedurally generated". Doom was and still is about the frantic experience. They already ruined Wolfenstein, let Doom be about fun. ||||| If like it if they took the route of wolfenstein. Decent story telling and raw white knuckle action. ||||| I think they should go with the approach similar to what Retro Studios has done with games like Donkey Kong Country. ||||| No offense OP, but I am totally against that. To the point where it ruins the desire for another game.  To me, Doom (Not so much Doom 3) was always about loading up a level you never been too, getting lost in it and trying to survive its dangers, traps, and secrets.   Open world kills one of the appeals of the classic Doom series, and that is creative map design, which I have never seen done well in a small confinement in most modern big world games.   Too many games I feel, are scared of the player being lost, which granted, is a modern design notion that is mostly positive.  ||||| What? No, god no. Are you insane?  What we need is something incredibly reminiscent of Doom 1&2. Absolutely no regen health, infinite guns, key cards, non linear level design, guns that feel powerful, running fast, variety of enemies, pure rock/metal/electronic ost, and a kickass art style. *That's* what Doom 4 needs. ||||| I think is going to be a lot like Wolfenstein the new order but with doom because in doom 2 rpg the marines name is Stan Blazkowicz and he is the son of bj Blazkowicz from Wolfenstein. So I think in doom it's going to be similar to the new order. And i hope that's what happens cause i love the new order and it would be an amazing game. the most fun things in wolfenstien are the boss battles and the guns it's so much fun dual wielding just shooting both shotguns rapid fire at nazi robots. Plus I think wolfenstien did a great job with the story. ||||| With the new wolfenstein, I bet its gonna play exactly like the new wolfenstein. And thats not exactly anything like doom, even though i did like wolfenstein   
4424	1,3,3,3	4	I've seen multiple people with dogs that do this. How does it work? How are they trained?  EDIT: I meant blood sugar, sorry. Thanks guys! ||||| Dogs don't actually sniff out blood pressure changes in people with Type 1 Diabetes, what they actually do is sniff out the blood sugar changes in a Diabetic patient. Specially trained dogs can detect something  called Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) which can indicate a change in blood sugar and thus alert the patient well before they start to feel unwell.  ||||| Not blood pressure, blood sugar levels. Can cause a certain scent on the persons breath, that even humans can detect at higher levels. I'm guessing the scent, while not noticed by humans, can be detected by some dogs at lower levels. ||||| The dogs are trained to be alerted by the smell of their owners breath, such as if their breath smells sweet their blood sugar levels are too high (not completely certain). Breath odor can diagnose quite a few things, a quick Google will give more information on this topic.
7069	1,3,3,3,3,3	6	I am currently a student so I figure I could use some flexible time with social or volunteer work. Not from this country and thus I am not sure how to find these jobs; while googling shows hundreds of work, is there any recommended opportunities you know that are time flexible?  Side note: I am a non-native speaker so probably can't do heavily talk-based works  Thanks! ||||| Have you tried volunteermatch.org? It can be good to research at least. It can give you a good idea and starting point for where to look for organizations that interest you. If there are specific organizations or nonprofit that grabs your attention you can always email them with questions. A lot of places are really open to having new volunteers. They may not have what you are looking for but it is a good way to start.  Also if you have a strong area of interest you can just look up the term. Phoenix metro is pretty big and there are lots of volunteer opportunities. I have found opportunities  by looking up "homeless nonprofits Arizona" and then just branching out and maybe sending a few emails from there.   If you are a student colleges also have good resources for volunteering. ASU has program call changemaker. The website is pretty good too.    Edit for example! Once I found some organizations to dwindle things down I found an organization that I really like that does offer volunteer work that I can do. So, I like working with homeless nonprofits and I can't volunteer during the work week. With that info I found this:  stvincentdepaul.net/volunteer  ||||| Hands On Phoenix has many one-time and reoccurring opportunities. [URL] ||||| [URL]  [URL] ||||| Habitat For Humanity is generally pretty flexible.  You can volunteer at one of their build sites (usually early Saturday mornings;) or in one of the resale shops (varying days/ times.) ||||| You should check out the [volunteer program]([URL] at the Phoenix Library system. It's a great fit for a student and may even translate into a part-time job down the road.
6059	1,3,3,3,3	5	It's a nice secret(ish) spot in Nicholasville. Its a nice place to go to. You can climb around and walk around the falls. We even climbed down. The waterfall is like 20 or so feet, but the hike down is intense. People know about it, but others say not ALOT of people have heard about it. I was wondering what you guys know.  ||||| Been there over a dozen times. It's on private property and since someone dies out there every so often (cliffs), you're not really supposed to be there, and I've been tossed out by PoPo before. And no offense to the OP, but threads like these that suggest everyone should check it out without mentioning it's on private property and you're not really supposed to be there, aren't going to help keep the place available to those of us that are local and do know about it.  Then again, I've very regrettably (you have no idea...) shown it to people that I wish I hadn't, so I'm being a hypocrite.  That being said it's beautiful, and dangerous. ||||| My friends and I use to go down there all the time. It's not too bad as long as you take your time getting down to the falls. Climbing up and down the actual falls can be dangerous if it's wet and slippery though. It is private property and the police will ask you to leave. Although, recently I've heard if you know the owner of the land and if you ask to go on his property and clean up any trash, he will allow you but that's not been confirmed. It is very beautiful and peaceful though.  ||||| I've been down there many times, my dad grew up in the area. I always take a trash bag and clean up bottles and cans...some of which have obviously been there since the 1970s. There's an old car buried up the creek a ways, and probably a few old washer/dryer units that have been dumped. I always wished it would have been opened up as a protected area with some support walkways like they have at the gorge so people could enjoy it...I'm amazed by the beauty every time I go.  All that said, it's true that many people have been injured or killed there over the years. If you go, beware.  ||||| Yup. Used to go there in high school, around 2000. The hike can be dangerous if you're not familiar with the territory and we were always paranoid of getting kicked out by a shotgun wielding local, but never did. 
1072	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	21	I have a very good source for acid. I had not tripped for two months, same with my boyfriend because we never had a day off together.   We finally had a day off together and got some of the same acid we used before, from the same 10 strip, we kept it in the dark and it wasn't bad.  Some background, a week before I had a day off, my work fired me for suspicious reasons. I talked to a lawyer and I have a very good case. Just the whole experience was and is still very traumatizing. Since that day, I barely ate or sleep and couldn't stop crying.   Anyway, one week after I lost my job, my bf and I finally have a day off together. We decide to drop acid around 10PM. We each had two tabs. IMEDIATELY after I swallowed the acid, I instantly regretted it and thought I would have a bad trip. I thought I was so stupid and thought I would be tripping about my job loss and think of myself as a failure.  I was obsessing over the idea of regret, and much to my surprise, the acid never kicked in. After an hour, my bf's pupils were huge, and he was tripping huge. Me, my pupils were normal sized, but I had no visuals, wasn't tripping, and I felt fine otherwise. No anxiety, no anything. My cheeks were a little flushed.   Did I block out an acid trip? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I don't take medication, I didn't do any other drugs, etc. it was just weird because as soon as I took it, I regretted it, and it ended up not working at all. ||||| [deleted] ||||| I don't have anything useful or helpful to say but damn that's kinda intense, if you think about it.  ||||| Whoever laid the sheet did a shitty job.  Which sucks for two reasons. You've experienced one of them, the other is that there are undoubtedly hot spots as well. You'll think you're taking one but you'll end up taking the equivalent of 2 or 3. ||||| Very interesting. My guess is that your traumatic experience resulted in a depressive episode, which was produced neurologically by depression of the serotonergic system within the brain.. So when you tried taking a drug which interacts with this system, it was less responsive then normal.  Only other possibilities would be uneven laying of sheet, or differences in how the LSD was stored.  Feel better soon :) ||||| [deleted] ||||| yea ive tripped and because of of circumstances in my life my brain was able to completely stop the trip but idk
4155	1,3,3,3	4	As the title suggests, I'm considering making a Templar mage following the Dawn's Wrath skill line. This would be mixed with the mages guild skill line and Destro staff.

Has this been buffed at all or would I be better off just going Sorc SC? ||||| there is no reason to stick to one skill tree in eso i would recommend going on tamriel foundry website and looking for templar builds with destro staff :) ||||| If you want to take a more proactive route.

Totally re-inspired now! ||||| Thanks so much for all the support! All my clothes are incredibly baggy and I haven't had a chance to show my progress to anyone yet.  ||||| Holy crap, congratulations! You look amazing!  ||||| Congrats on developing so much dedication to fitness. That has been a big struggle for me, even more so than eating healthy.   Your start weight is really close to mine and CW goal is really close to my GW - your progress pics "before" looks so much like body it is crazy, lol. Like I would double take if I just saw that somewhere and think "someone was in my room!" Hopefully my GW will look as good as you do now on me! I hope all of that doesn't sound creepy, lol.  ||||| Great job on your progress!

4967	1,3	5	A while back there was an indie game company that was promoting their FPRPG/Dungeon Crawler, and the game looked pretty cool. To top it off, there was a guy who was physically disabled that wanted to play the game, so they just added controls so he could when the game was released. It was really cool of them.  I added a bookmark for the site, but since then my old PC broke and I got a new one, meaning I don't have any of my old bookmarks. I really want to know what this game was and if it's out yet, because I want to continue to support it and get it for a friend who is disabled. ||||| I believe that was Legend of Grimrock, and it is out.
4830	1,3,3,3,3,3	12	I'll be acquiring an Ipad 2 pretty soon and I've always been curious about jail breaking. I'd like to get a bit more information on some of the goods and bads that can come from doing it. ||||| Jailbreaking allows you to add additional functionality to the device as well as open up applications from alternative sources (Cydia). There are many apps on Cydia that were rejected from the app store and are doing quite well in sales. Additionally, there are tweaks that can be made to the iOS interface (five icon dock, five icon grid layouts, etc) that become available with jailbreaking the device.  There is currently no way to jailbreak iPad2 devices running 4.3.5* or newer versions of iOS. You could downgrade if you had the SHSH keys for your device, but that would have required you previously jailbreaking the device. I purchased a new iPad2 in October and it came with iOS 4.3.5, so I was stuck and unable to jailbreak the device.  There is a jailbreak currently in the works for iOS 5.0.1 for A5 devices (iPhone 4S, iPad2), and supposedly they are very close to releasing it. Watch [/r/jailbreak](/r/jailbreak) for an announcement.  Also check out [[URL] for information on jailbreaking and what versions, etc work for what devices.   *I did a quick search on the exact version, but that is what I recall my device came with.  Edit: including information on jailbrea.kr ||||| Just an update. The iPad2 Jailbreak has been released today. It is Mac OSX only right now, but it is out. ||||| I would just wait for the ipad 3 because it's right around the corner. Should be announced by March.  ||||| Con: it's still an iPad. ||||| bads: you void your warranty

9468	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	25	I don't exactly understand why they're considered bad. Basically what I'm asking is, what do they lack that most competitive decks have in bulk? What should be added to them in order to put them on the same playing field? ||||| Have to disagree with the other comment, the boss monsters are actually quite good. What they are missing is any kind of card advantage. You are going to blow your whole hand on one boss with no kind of recovery and you cant really set 4 either. Toy vendor, which fulfils the role that brings the deck together like blaze accel mag in volcanics just absolutely sucks. It needs something to pull cards out of the deck into your hand, and draw more cards when youve already used them ||||| They don't have a consistent way of bringing out Wolf aka their win condition. You almost never have Edge Imp Sabres WITH a Polymerization WITH a bunch of Fluffal monsters in hand. On top of that Wolf doesn't have any ways to protect himself so if he dies you basically lost the game. They will get better once Frightfur Tiger comes out, but that can take god knows how long. ||||| They don't have a single win condition. Wolf can OTK if you can pump him up with something but the deck straight up dies to any and every backrow, especially the all-too-common Vanity's, has simply awful main deck monsters, their Pot thing is a giant minus waiting to happen, no inherent protection, disruption, or any sort of offensive capabilities beyond making "beatstick" fusions.   They can blow their entire hand on a single fusion, get Bottomless/Torrential/Fire Lake/Compulsed/Book Of Moon/PWWB/Skill Drain'd and they are left with 0 resources and no way to recover jackshit.  TBH the deck simply has *nothing* going for it. It needs anything resembling an engine, main deck monsters that aren't anus, fusions that can actually acomplish anything on their own, some sort of way to replenish hand ***and*** something to search their monsters more easily, and backrow support that can keep them alive. ||||| Lol viable? The question is what are fluffals' identity? Cause they sure don't have one.  ||||| A broken card.   Every meta deck has a few really good cards that make the deck viable. Examples include: Qliphort Tool, Super Poly, Construct, Dante, Fire Lake, Sphere, Sanctum etc.  Fluffals don't really have any advantage cards, all of them are 141s or minuses. They rely on special summoning and effects making them weak against Emptiness and Skill Drain both commonly run.  That said the deck would need some completely new, good cards that would make them viable. ||||| People that don't understand the deck sadden me. What they're missing from making them better is their own tuner and rank 3. The deck IMO won't ever be a viable deck competitively, it can compete at a tier 2 level at most while being able to steal games off of the big three if you play optimally and are lucky, the deck just isn't as consistent as it could be, and the ability to search a tuner would help that, preferably one that is special summoned off of discard. ||||| Good cards. 
5482	1,3,3	6	Hey I have a 12 year old and he is supposed to bring his iOS devices out of his room at bed time otherwise he'll be playing all night long. Unfortunately he keeps sneaking them back in there and staying up late. Now I know any parental control is no substitute for parenting I was wondering is there any way to impose a time limit to when his device will work...say from8 am to 9pm in order to discourage his sneaking via settings or a third party app?  Thanks   ||||| Hide the devices from him when it is time to go to bed. ||||| We take them away from him but once in a great while life gets insane and we forget. I just thought if you could make them shut off (maybe turn them back on with a parental password) it would rob him of any incentive to sneak it.

5041	1,3,3	4	This is going to be my first time attempting any sort of time lapse. So I wanted to try and get some advice before I dive in headfirst. I have a hero 4 black. I live in a very rural environment and plan of camping out on a large hill. Also, I plan on doing this this weekend during the new moon. Any advice will be appreciated! ||||| I wouldn't do it with a new moon unless you want the moonlight to drown out the starlight.  My advice: play around with the Protune settings before letting the nightlapse run, use the app to see what your picture looks like. Read up on ISO and WB and decide what you want it to ultimately look like, you could always just run it on auto but you might as well tailor your timelapse,   Have fun and show us the finished product! ||||| Try 30 second exposures with ISO at 800. Also point the camera away from the moon's trajectory so it doesn't overpower the stars. Definitely take a few test photos at different settings to see what works with your environment.

6006	1,0,3	14	[empty] ||||| I'm not sure where the other poster is getting their information from, but it's *very* inaccurate.  *Le(s)* is used for indirect objects and *lo(s)*/*la(s)* for direct objects. However, using *le* as a direct object pronoun in place of *lo* is acceptable to refer to one man (i.e. *him* or formal *you*). To summarize, the following is standard in Spanish (i.e. always acceptable, even in formal settings):  * *Lo*  = Direct object (neuter and masculine, singular): *him, it, you* (formal, one man). * *Los* = Direct object (neuter, masculine and mixed gender, plural): *them, you* (formal, one or more men). * *La* = Direct object (feminine, singular): *her, it, you* (formal, one woman). * *Las* = Direct object (feminine, plural): *them, you* (formal, two or more women and no men). * *Le* = Indirect object (neuter, masculine and feminine, singular): *him, her, it, you* (formal); Direct object: *him, you* (formal, one man). * *Les* = Indirect object (neuter, masculine and feminine, plural): *them, you* (formal, plural).  That said, in some places (mostly the central and northern parts of Spain) it's pretty common to hear people use *le(s)* instead of *lo(s)/la(s)* as a direct object when referring to people. In those places, the distinction is more on whether the referent is a person or a thing (as with *him* vs. *it* in English). When this happens, it's called *leísmo* and should be avoided in formal writing.  Sometimes knowing whether you should use *lo(s)/la(s)* or *le(s)* can be a bit tricky (especially with ditransitive verbs), but for *ver* it's pretty straight forward: it's a transitive verb and can take a direct object, so the person being seen should be the direct object:  * *Vi a Carlos > Lo vi.* (*I saw Carlos > I saw him* -- *Le* also acceptable) * *Vi a María > La vi* (*I saw Maria > I saw her* -- *Le* is **not** acceptable) * *Vi a Carlos y María > Los vi* (*I saw Carlos and Maria > I saw them* -- *Les* is **not** acceptable) * *Vi a Maria y su madre > Las vi* (*I saw Maria and her mother > I saw them* -- *Les* is **not** acceptable) * *Vi un accidente > Lo vi* (*I saw an accidente > I saw it* -- *Le* is **not** acceptable)  Here are a few examples with indirect object pronouns:  - *Di un beso a Maria > Le di un beso > Se lo di = I gave Maria a kiss > I gave her a kiss > I gave it to her*.   - *Pronoun correspondence*: a Maria > le > se > Maria > her > her; un beso = lo = lo > a kiss > a kiss > it. - *A las bananas a veces se les llaman guineos > Sometimes people call bananas "guineos."   = *Sometimes people call them "guineos"**   - *Pronoun correspondence*: a las bananas > les = bananas > them. - *Di una foto a Carlos > Le di una foto > Se la di = I gave Carlos a photo > I gave him a photo > I gave him it.*   - *Pronoun correspondence*: a Carlos > le > se = Carlos > him > him; una foto > una foto > la > a photo > a photo > it.  I hope this helps, but if not let me know what's unclear.  ||||| "Le" tends to be *seen* (it is used more in formal contexts for some reason, it's not necessarily more formal) as more formal than "Lo", it also lacks gender, since it refers indirectly to something.    ie.: "Lo vi"= I saw him. "Le vi" = I saw it.  "La vi" = I saw her.     Although sometimes you'll see people using "Le" and refer to something masculine too. (Put this backwards earlier)    Edit: Made a correction above. Also, stated that it's formality is subjective. It varies from region to region. ie. In Mexico it is seen as "polite" to talk to strangers asking stuff like: "¿Le ayudo?" instead of "¿L@ ayudo?", both mean: "Can I help you?".

3969	1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3	17	I have a Druid that has Thunderwave. If I were to use it and push an enemy into my party's paladin, what would happen. I couldn't find any RAW in the PHB or sage advice. Since in the PHB it says you can't willingly enter an enemies square. I personally would rule that the enemy would just hit the paladin and stop, but I would like more opinions/rulings on this matter. ||||| I would have the paladin make the same save and suffer the same effects except taking no damage regardless of success or failure.  I would give him advantage/disadvantage if the creature was a different size than him.  Just working from the idea that the creature is for all intents and purposes a dumb object in motion because the motion isn't voluntary and a dumb object doesn't care about friend or foe, it does the same thing regardless, each action has an equal and opposite reaction etc. (or you could pretend they are billiard balls and the creatures movement gets halted and the paladin continues it, a theoretic elastic collision) ||||| When this happens I normally have them get pushed to the side of them. Essentially to the next available space. If no such space exists then they just stop right there. ||||| I've never had this come up in one of my games, and since everyone else offered some reasonable suggestions I thought I would throw another possible solution out.  Let the paladin use a reaction to either:  * Opportunity Attack the creature to stop movement * or Dex save to move to an adjacent square ||||| Sounds like a reasonable solution to me.  Alternatively, I may have the paladin make the same spell save DC, and on a failure, be pushed to accomodate the new creature. ||||| RAW you are exactly right.  ||||| Well, Thunderwave hits friends and foes alike. If it can shove the enemy as far as the Paladin's square, then shouldn't it also move the Paladin one square?  Maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, coming from years of 3.5 and Pathfinder, my homebrew call would be that the Paladin has to make a Str check against the spell's DC or else be pushed one square when the enemy entered her square. If she wasn't moved, then I'd stop the enemy's movement in front of her.  ||||| I positioned myself so that the spell hit the enemy and not the paladin. ||||| I would have the enemy hit the paladin and stop, because the spell was positioned to purposefully not hit the paladin. Because they are both in the same square, they would suffer from disadvantage to attack rolls until one of them moved (not a big deal except for opportunity attacks).
5760	1,3,3	3	For example, should we continue to refer to players who frequently play AP carry roles as "mid laners"?  As everyone knows, the meta has changed over the years and will undoubtedly continue to change, but the tradition for some time has been that the top and mid solo laners are defined by the lane they occupy. Interestingly though, we don't assign the role "bot" to Support or AD, since two people occupy the lane and it would be indistinguishable if both were referred to as "bot laners". Practically speaking, this makes sense. But does it make sense to continue to refer to players as "mid laners" or "top laners"? Wouldn't it be more practicable to come up with another name that better suits the role they fulfill?  There are, of course, some practical problems with answering these questions. We can't call mid laners the "AP carry" as they are sometimes referred to, because we often see (and have increasingly seen) people play AD mids like Zed, Ezreal, Jayce, etc. Similarly, we can't refer to "top laners" as "Tank" because, though the current meta supports tanky top laners (Shen, Zac, etc.), sometimes people play carry roles in the top lane (Renekton, Nidalee, Ryze, etc.).  But at the same time, I don't think we can continue to refer to a player's role in accordance with the lane they are supposed to occupy or that they occupied according to a meta that has since evolved. While this doesn't necessarily apply to lower-level play, at the highest competitive level we see lane swaps all the time in order to obtain 2v1 lane advantages. Some games we see the AD and Support go mid, other times they're bot or top. Additionally, the so-called "mid laners" and "top laners" can appear in virtually any lane. In other words, referring to a person's role according to lane is not only illogical, but it can be confusing for new viewers trying to understand the game when they see the supposed "top laner" in the bottom lane, going 1v2 instead of head-to-head with the enemy top laner. This could be particularly confusing when casters, in the pre-game analysis, refer to the "matchup" of one team's mid laner versus the opponent's mid laner, only for the viewer to find out that this matchup doesn't really exist in lane.  Now, obviously this is just an issue of labeling which doesn't bear much consequence for most of us here. But for some people, it might be confusing at first; and, really, it doesn't make much sense to continue using this outdated form of role labeling. I don't really have a practical solution myself, and I'm not necessarily suggesting that the current way we refer to roles should change anytime soon, but I thought it would be an interesting conversation to have within the community to see if we can come together on some kind of potential solution, if any. ||||| Solo Laners, Duo Laners, and Junglers. No need to make it more complicated than that.  ||||| I think it would get out of hand if we identified players by their character's classifications.

[BABY_CHILD_CAP:100:1000]  From the [wiki]([URL] 'This allows you to control the number of babies+children in your fortress. The first number is an absolute cap on the number of babies+children.

By the time the tykes grow up, they're actually decent farmers, too. ||||| Build a room which is wall-to-wall cage traps. Place children in room. Lower drawbridge that was blocking line-of-sight to the Giant Cave Spider you have behind fortifications. The spider will web the kids, which will cause them to activate the cage traps. Raise the drawbridge, moves the cages to your children stockpile, and enjoy both an FPS boost and easier child-care management.  Ideally your child stockpile is next to your butchery/kitchen, so helper dwarves don't have to walk very far to bring them food/drink.

7946	1,3,3,3,3,3	10	So I'm still trying to catch on to competitive smash and one of the first things I saw was perfect pivoting. I've practiced it a bit and have used it in matches here and there (the for grabs more than tilts) and am not sure how I feel about it.  Now I'm far from a very knowledgeable player in smash, I've got tons to learn. But I'm not quite picking up on the usefulness of using the technique.  Also for a side question: I asked a while ago what advanced techniques I should know/practice. Most suggestions said to just play and learn your characters combos/matchups etc, which is what I've been doing and don't plan on stopping with. But I can't help but feel like there are many things that I can't learn alone and I don't exactly have a lot of smash friends to talk to.   So any helpful information would be much appreciated! Also I'm down to answer any questions anyone might have that can help them help me :3 Thanks!  edit: I just found out about roll cancel grabs, plan on testing this today. As a falcon player it seems pretty awesome. ||||| Perfect pivot is useful and some characters can abuse it more than others. Also RAR is a thing.

5983	1,3,3,2,3,3	6	I hope the title is fine with the posting guidelines, it was kind of hard to word.  I'm at the young age of 15 and I really want to get more into programming. I've been boxed in with the website code academy and never have really decided to look for anything else. I thought of reddit and found this subreddit. I saw an awesome abundance of links and got excited. A lot of the links that seem the most productive have that word "course" in it. That makes me think that it's for more older people, like 18 and 21. With that mindset, it's hard to find something to turn to. Then you click something like start and asks like your first name and last name, so I hope you see where i'm a little skeptical.    **In short words**  I need more resources to turn to at the young age of 15. Also i'd like a confirmation of rather these "course" links are not age restricted or not. ||||| There are kids younger than you who've graduated college.  No, courses aren't usually age restricted, though an instructor might occasionally drop a bad word or something.  You should probably ask a parent to create your account, though, and to take a quick look to make sure that you're not getting into something spooky or dangerous, since every link is different.  But that's just normal caution.  The reality is that kids your age are overly sheltered these days.  You're spoonfed your education in such pathetic dribs and drabs by yokels who've never worked in the fields they teach you.  It's basically daycare.  My world changed when I realized I could walk into a bookstore, lay down a week or two's allowance, and get the same textbook that MIT students are reading for an upper level class taught by one of the best instructors in the world.  And that book will contain much of the same material, and teach me all sorts of awesome stuff.  I've bought probably over a hundred such books over the years.  Not textbooks necessarily, but nonfiction books.  Go into Barnes and Noble or even your library, and ask for the programming section.  Or the drawing section.  Or the foreign language section, or medical section, etc.  And that was before we had so many online courses available.  It's amazing.  You're right to be a little intimidated, but it's not because you're not ready.  It's just because your schools have spent over half your life telling you that you're not ready, and that you have to learn at THEIR pace, and learn what THEY tell you to learn.  That's not how life works.  Go borrow a chartbook and plot your own course. ||||| No, it's not (necessarily) for older people. But it would depend a lot on which links you're referring to.  I assume you're referring to the MOOCs on sites like Coursera and Udemy? It would depend on the course. Most of those courses, however, are computer science, and will thus have a bit of math to them, but within the level of a 15 year old (mostly high school level algebra). ||||| What did they do to you that you think you would have to be scared? ||||| Start off with code academy and learn HTML/CSS first just to get used to the idea ||||| Try out some of the "course" links, they are not age restricted. Don't give up on them until you've at least given it your best shot.

My question is, why do true solutions like KMnO4 have color as opposed to say salt solutions? ||||| In your examples, the colour is due to how light interacts with the particles in the liquid - for example, due to the [Tyndall effect]([URL] in milk (or just plain scattering giving rise to its opacity), or from other, size-dependent effects like [quantum confinement]([URL] in colloidal gold (which is completely different from other scattering phenomena).  In a true solution, the colour you observe is due to [molecular absorption]([URL] The molecular orbitals have specific energy differences such that photons of that energy will be absorbed. This is the mechanism by which organic dyes and many other metallic dyes are coloured.  In other words, you do not need actual, non-solvated particles for something to be coloured. A molecule itself can have its own [absorption spectrum]([URL] and this is the basis of many spectroscopic techniques. ||||| Very crudely explained from my memory of college chemistry, it's the d block elements forming ligand-ion complexes allowing light of a particular wavelength to pass through, relative to the actual element. The Manganese in KMnO4 would be the element responsible for this, however a salt solution comprising of H2O and NaCl, has no d block element to form this complex with.

2822	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	18	I'm kinda disappointed that they seem to have missed what makes most FPS games engaging. One thing I love is being able to see someone out of the corner of my eye and react accordingly but it seems that in BF3, even on a lowly 16 slot server, the lag makes fast reactions completely pointless.   I haven't yet had that "WOAH close call, I'm so lucky I managed to react that fast" because it results in me being behind cover and dying regardless.  Does no-one else feel this is quite a problem? This is apparently entirely new netcode to fix stuff like dusting in BF2 too... ||||| dont complain about the netcode. I did that once and was told to not play for being ungrateful.  ||||| Scoreboard needs a column for ping/latency IMO ||||| I notice it constantly, even on servers with a low double-digit ping.

Very annoying. ||||| i haven't experienced any lag except for on Tehran Highway ||||| As bad as the netcode is, it's infinitely better than BFBC2. Still shitty coding from DICE, though ||||| I think it's just that the standard bullet damage modifier is set too high or the players health too low. This makes reacting to incoming fire nearly impossible. In battlelog you can see what these values are for the individual servers. If DICE doesn't fix this, then maybe servers themselves should alter these values to make it more enjoyable.

5720	1,3,3	22	Played a game as Jarvan recently.  When you cast his flag, it doesn't go where you click (as targeted AoEs should), it goes the furthest distance it can towards where you click.  This means that if you target it into a bush or over a wall or something and you're not close enough, you'll waste the flag, when normally you're supposed to run into range.  Basically, it's casting like skill shots do.  Is this a bug or were all targeted AoEs changed to be like this?  Side note: Diana's Q has always casted like this, and it sucks, since the move basically functions like a targeted AoE.  I wish we had the option to set this for ourselves. ||||| They changed the Demacian Standard to do this because it is a quality of life buff aimed at making it much smoother to cast a maximum range E-Q combo. You should know the Standard's maximum casting range anyways. I almost never flub it trying to get vision on a far bush. ||||| I hate it. In my opinion RIOT nerfed Jarvans gameplay experience with that cast change

9338	1,3,3	9	Just getting into woodworking, and I can tell I'm going to need a nail gun to do some cabinet building, some trim, and some paneling.  I'm seeing two different kinds of nail guns out there - brad nailers and finish nailers - and I would like to know what the difference is, and what situations would require each.  Can someone give me some advice? ||||| Brad nailers shoot an 18 gauge nail usually up to 2" long, and finish nailers will shoot a larger 15 or 16 gauge nail which can be a little longer, up to 2 and a half inches.  These numbers will vary slightly based on hardware - there are going to be exceptions.    For trim work, the finish nailer is great for installing typical casing and baseboards to walls and I have no trouble with quarter round either.  The brad nailer would be useful for very small or thin trim which the finish nailer would split.  In terms of woodworking construction, I would use a brad nailer to secure joints while the glue dries and for attaching trim to a piece.  Also, in my opinion I prefer to get pneumatic nailers.  You have the initial expense of a compressor but the nailers themselves are cheaper. ||||| In all honesty if you are new to woodworking your best bet is a hammer.

6848	1,3,3,3	5	I've adopted a baby tiel about a week ago. Both her and I are getting used to each other by now, and I really enjoy being with her.  Today, she've been making two interesting sounds, and I wasn't sure what she's asking for.   The first sounds like a noise from a broken radio, giving a continuous buzzing sound. She were trying so hard to get a piece of millet for a while (which she eventually failed), so I assumed it was from distress... but the noise continued for like 30 minutes even after I gave one, so not really sure.  The second one sounds the squeak the rubber makes sliding through a surface, with the frequency of a second or shorter. If it helps, she was very sleepy. ||||| Your radio sound is probably the tiel asking for food.

1884	1,3,3	4	My bay girl Pumpkin is almost two and a half years old. Overall she seems healthy, a little overweight but otherwise fine. She still climbs the side of her cage, able to groom herself, and moves regularly, however I've notice a few things that are making me nervous:  1) She doesn't pick up her tail when she moves, it drags along behind her. 2) She tries to scratch herself with her hind legs but she never makes contact. When I massage her she seems content so I know she has feeling in her hind quarters but she can't physically scratch. She is overweight but she has always been on the bigger side so I'm not sure if it's related.  Obviously, I will care for her no matter what, but I want to be prepared if and when paralysis comes. Are these signs of early paralysis or am I being paranoid? If this looks like paralysis, what should I be mindful of? ||||| It might be but it doesn't sound very serious yet. A lot of old rodents drag their tails. As long as she's climbing, I don't think I'd worry about it.   Even if she does start slowing down, it doesn't mean it will be fast paralysis either, if that's truly what it is. I've had several sets of rats over the last twenty years- with my boys, as they age, I just slowly start lowering the top shelves and making the ramps less steep when they start to have trouble with them. ||||| If you see her start dragging her back feet behind her, that's one of the sure signs that paralysis is starting. One of my old boys, Ghostface, tried really hard to hide that it was happening to him, but I finally noticed that he was dragging his back feet and basically pulling himself along by his front arms. I wish I had noticed sooner, because I would have definitely put him and my other elderly rat in a single-level cage.

Any money saved in transaction fees using credit cards etc. is outweighed by the commission fees charged when converting £/$/etc. to bitcoin.

Is it divisible by four? If so, your basis hold. Now assume f(k) holds. Then f(k) = 4*m for some integer m, because f(k) is divisible by four.   But then f(k+1) = (2(k+1) - 1)*3k+1 + 1 = (2k -1 + 2)*3*3^k + 1 = ...

Hope this helps.  edit: spelling, good catch Dtailz ||||| If you're playing the game on an HD TV without an HDMI cable its going to be blurry ||||| Then it is probably your TV set ||||| If you're using composite A/V (one yellow cable for video), then downscaling the game to SD resolutions is going to make it look like crap.  If you're using component, DVI, or HDMI, you should be fine.  Another issue you can have is that some cheap TVs have really weird resolutions due to their use of panels meant for other purposes initially and (of course) crap internal scalers.

Before this dlc, all of the end game stuff was just a boss. It seems to me they want to incorporate more of a "raid" feel, hence the you die you start the mission over, and the ability to overpower it. This followed by the next dlcs being shorter and being more of a "run" or "raid" than an expansion. I actually really like that direction. You have a set start/finish to what you want to do. I can play for an hour and complete a raid instead of farming Pete 6 times in a row or something, or needing to leave halfway through a long mission because the group I joined did a few quick quests and then a long one.

Please give us some clarity on this! ||||| good question, i'm gonna go with yes since the contents of packages are determined the moment the package is earned.  EDIT - you should try to get as close as possible without going over and earning the package until after HoW is rolled out.  That way, you will have a chance at HoW gear when you go over the limit and earn the package.  Sure you will forego the commendation that will turn into 250 rep but to me it's more important to have a shot at HoW loot.  I have over 80 commendations saved up so there's that.

6097	1,3,3,2,2,3	8	I set up a server with an old Pentium 4 desktop and some old hard drives and ram dimms I had laying around, and was wondering if I should repartition the hard drives. I have one newish 500GB and two old 160GB hard drives. I have a raid 5 array (in software) set up, alon with / and /home partitons on the 500GB drive. I kind of want raid 5 on these old disk but I'm concerned with the performance penalty and heat output on such an old processor. Another option would be to set up some encryption volumes on the disk. Nothing important is going on it  This is more of an advice question than a tech support question.   tl;dr: raid 1, raid 5, lvm, or encrypted volumes. ||||| > I have one newish 500GB and two old 160GB hard drives. I have a raid 5 array (in software) set up, alon with / and /home partitons on the 500GB drive. I kind of want raid 5 on these old disk but I'm concerned with the performance penalty and heat output on such an old processor.  Color me confused.  You have RAID5 on *what*?  You can't have that on just one drive.  If you want to encrypt things, the easiest thing is to make a drive/partition into an encrypted LUKS container *first*.  Then use the LUKS containers (at least one per drive) as the physical volumes to create either a `mdadm` administered RAID5 volume, or a `lvm` administered logical volume of type `raid5`.  (Yes, they are kind of the same thing.)  Indeed, if you want to do encryption, I'd go this route:  * Make both the 160GB drives completely into LUKS containers.     * When you do this, specify the *device* and not a *partition* on the device, e.g., create the LUKS on `/dev/sdb` and *not* on `/dev/sdb1`.  This overwrites any lingering MBR on the drive with the LUKS header. * Make a 1 GB partition on the 500GB drive for `/boot`, and make an `ext2` filesystem in it. * Make a second partition from the rest of the 500GB drive. * Make the second partition on the 500GB drive a LUKS container. * Import all three LUKS containers as `physical volumes` in LVM. * Using only physical extents from the LUKS container on the 500GB drive, create a 20 GB logical volume for the root filesystem.   * You don't want the root filesystem to span multiple encrypted volumes&mdash;it's a PITA to boot if it does. * Using physical extents from all three LUKS containers, create a 240 GB (120+120+120) logical volume of `type=raid5` for `home`.   * Yes, you will leave ≈40 GB per drive unallocated.  You can allocate the free space to whatever needs it when the time comes. * Create three 2 GB logical volumes, each one using physical extents from only one LUKS container.  Make them into swap-space, 6 GB total (I'm guessing you don't have more than 4 GB of RAM.)  Don't bother with striping them across drives.  The kernel can handle allocating pages between multiple swap spaces.   * At this point you've got ≈ 350 GB unused on the big drive, to do whatever with.  You might-could use it for one set of backups.  You'll need to duplicate them to somewhere else, in case the big drive goes down.  Now for the fun and games of mounting the LUKS containers.    * Since you've got three encrypted volumes, if you want to mount all of them at the very beginning of the boot process, you'll have to enter three passphrases into the terminal.  *  Personally, I think that's a PITA.  I think it's better to just enter one passphrase to unlock the encrypted volume on the 500 GB drive, then have the other two unlocked using *keyfiles*. * For specifics, see: [wiki.archlinux.org/Dm-crypt/Keyfiles]([URL]   * Summary:    * …create a keyfile in the home directory of the `root` account, i.e., `/root/keyfile`;    * …make it accessible only by root, i.e., `chmod 400`;    * …add the keyfile to a keyslot in the LUKS header of each of the 160 GB drives;    * …modify `/etc/crypttab` to have the system automagically unlock the  LUKS containers using the keyfile.   * BTW, this is why you don't want the system's root filesystem on a logical volume that spans multiple drives.  Because it needs to be able to boot with only one LUKS container unlocked, and then it can unlock the other two on its own.  IMO, the nice thing about LVM instead of `mdadm` is that you can leave chunks of space not only unallocated to filesystems, but unallocated to any particular sort of block-level striping, mirroring, or whatever.  Later on you can do silly things like create an 80 GB mirrored volume, one side of which is on the big drive, and the other side of which is split between the two smaller drives.  Or, create a 40 GB volume with *three* mirrors.  Whatever floats yer boat.  Oh, and the CPU won't care much about the LVM stuff.  Or `mdadm` if you go that route.  It really doesn't take much extra computing to stripe data across drives and calculate data parities along the way.  The encrypted volumes are more likely to put a drag on the system, but I don't know how much.  Give it a shot and see what happens.  ||||| I've had experience using LVM as raid1 before.   Let my experience stand as a warning to others, LVM does not handle failure gracefully. period.   Run mdraid, and run LVM over the top of it. Best use of available tools. ||||| > Nothing important is going on it  Does that mean a flaming death wouldn't be a big deal? ||||| What are you using currently for the RAID 5? LVM is software RAID as well, so I'm slightly confused.    I've had a pretty good experience using LVM with RAID 1 on three 500GB drives in an jurry-rigged NAS (P4 as well.)   I'd also suggest checking out [FreeNAS]([URL] if your not dead-set on using Linux ||||| Redundancy in volumes is over-rated. If one filesystem screws up, or you accidentally delete something redundancy won't help you as it will mirror the problems.  I'd make two separate LVM volumes on separate groups of physical disks and have one as a nightly backup. Preferably your backup is in a different location, to protect from power-surges, etc, but it's still better to have proper backups than redundancy.  Redundancy is great in commercial settings where you want to keep the volume running whatever happens and have enough resources to have backups and redundancy. For most home users, if one has backups, redundancy is rather... redundant IMO. I see far too many people using redundancy as a substitute for backups when their purposes are really quite different.  I'd also only use RAID if I had a decent RAID card. Re-building using software is very variable IME.

While I was away in Japan for a couple weeks for work my girl Stella was prancing about the house as usual….until she found a small crevice in-between the bookshelf and the fireplace. Now, this wouldn't be so much of a problem had she not proceeded to stick her head in-between them and get stuck.

Yes, while my poor parents were watching a movie he leapt into the fireplace through the mesh and proceeded to dook around and into the fire. When I heard the screaming I ran downstairs and he was promptly saved. Nice end of the story, right? NO.

So when I get home I go straight to bed. Next morning there was poop everywhere, and food too. Urine soaked their blankets and such. It was gross but not gross enough to turn me from my fuzzy hellions. Lol! Ya clean up and get over it!

Cause if they poop elsewhere and its not cleaned well and that smell of themselves removed, they will continue to make mess there.
6634	1,3,3,3	10	While watching Norwegian news I fond the verb *lykkes*. The German translation suggested it's used impersonal (det lykkes (ham)).

7304	1,3,3	3	I've been playing for a while now and I've got food, water, weapons, tools, and basic medical supplies on farm (mostly figurative, somewhat literal). It seems like the only things that I can't farm forever are advanced medical supplies and fire lighting tools. Is there anything I'm missing?   Also is well water sterile? Because that would mean I wouldn't even strictly need the fire. ||||| Well no sooner did I post that than I tripped over a waiting crawler and got zombified. Karma's a bitch. ||||| You can farm fire lighting tools by turning planks into notched wooden planks.  Advanced medical supplies might be farmable down the line, devs have talked about an Herbalist profession to gather and create medicines that might not be as potent as pharmaceuticals but can still get the job done.

9070	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	38	When I met her I ate meat and dairy and felt a bit tired and had chronic fatigue often.  For the past month, I've been eating vegan (HCLF) and I feel amazing.  She eats meat and I don't have an issue with her choices nor do I judge them as I'm not trying to change anyone.  She says stuff like I'm no fun anymore and makes me feel like I suddenly changed and how it's not fair to her and that if I was vegan when we originally met, she wouldn't have ever dated me ( we ate out a lot at fast food places together).  How do I proceed with this?  Don't tell me to break up with her as that's an extreme I'd rather not resort to. ||||| From your post, it sounds like she'd also think you weren't fun if you weren't vegan, but even just stopped eating fast food and junk food with her.      It sounds like eating junk food was a comforting activity you used to do together. Maybe you can come up with something else for the two of you to share and relax with.      There are lot of vegan options for alcohol if you drink. You two could take turns coming up with new drinks to try, start movie nights, or pretty much any activity that appeals to both of you. ||||| What else do you guys do for fun? Other than eating fast food  ||||| She sounds nice ||||| > if I was vegan when we originally met, she wouldn't have ever dated me  Cool. Bye.  > Don't tell me to break up with her as that's an extreme I'd rather not resort to.  Sounds like she's attempting to be awfully controlling. That does not make a functional, happy relationship. ||||| [My advice to you]([URL]  Seriously though, relationships are two ways.  If you better yourself and she tries to make that a problem; she needs to rethink what she is doing and you need to rethink what this relationship does for you. ||||| There could be a myriad of things that are making her feel uncomfortable about it, but she should be stoked you're eating healthier and care about yourself.   I saw in your other comment that you've gone from party-drink-eat-junk to plant-based and also meditate. If it's only been a month, she might have felt like you shifted pretty quick and feels a bit disconnected. You need to find new activities together to bond more. She probably doesn't feel as close to you even though she doesn't mean it negatively. ||||| Have you tried talking to her? Ask her why she feels that way.  ||||| Try picking out a recipe and cooking with her?  ||||| look, there's nothing wrong with beginning a new, positive phase of your life, but you will find that sometimes other people in your life get left behind. that's called adulthood. that's growing up, and being able to make decisions that take care of YOU rather than doing destructive things because they're 'fun'. sorry if that comes across as condescending but it's true. you've got a new maturity that maybe your girlfriend doesn't have, yet.  having said that, it's not like when you sign up to veganism you swear off fun. you've got to reconnect with your girlfriend based on what you both find fun. as previously mentioned, there are plenty of fast food joints that cater for vegans, and a lot of low-budget ethnic cuisine can be vegan too. i also love cooking meals - maybe that's something your girlfriend might enjoy doing with you. and of course there is vegan alcohol (barnivore.com), although you might be 'over' alcohol if you're meditating a lot.  but i will also say this: your girlfriend's attitude says a lot more about HER, her maturity and where she's at in her life, than it does about you and your choices. think about that, because only you can say whether you are still compatible.  ||||| Did you start a plant based diet for health reasons or did you become a vegan for ethical reasons - for the animals?    We might be able to help you more effectively if we knew where you were coming from.  :)   Have you watched any vegan videos with her?  ||||| I'm surprised no one has suggested this yet, but why don't you try to have a discussion with her and explain some of the reasons why you are vegan now, watch your favourite doco with her, earthlings is pretty hard hitting and a lot of people say it's a bad one to watch first but I disagree.  It sounds like she's tryna pull you backwards, so you should at least tryna pull her forward with you before conceding defeat and allow her to continue thinking veganism is 'boring' (Which it's not, and is irrelevant even if it were).  If she can't see the importance of what you're doing for the world, the animals, and yourself after earthlings, then she might not be right for you anymore, or you'll just have to learn to live in disagreement over something that very important to you. I couldn't do it personally. ||||| >if I was vegan when we originally met, she wouldn't have ever dated me ( we ate out a lot at fast food places together). How do I proceed with this? Don't tell me to break up with her as that's an extreme I'd rather not resort to.  So why is she still dating you? It sounds like she already resorted to that "extreme." ||||| What would she do if you had a medical condition and a doctor ordered you to change your diet and stop eating fast food? Pout and say you're no fun? A supportive partner doesn't encourage you to eat more unhealthy junk food. ||||| If you want to get fast food together, try Taco Bell.  You can customize anything on the menu to be vegan (substitute beans for meat, leave out cheese, sour cream, and any "creamy" sauces, maybe add guac or potatoes).  Their [app]([URL] makes it easy to customize stuff. ||||| a friend of mine said the same thing to me, that i'm "no fun anymore" because i'm vegan. i guess because i can't go out for fast food with her anymore. even though i'm fine with Taco Bell.  best advice i can give is find out what exactly it is that makes you "not fun", and then explain how you can still do those "fun" things or at least substitutes for them. ||||| I'm really sorry to hear that this is happening. It sucks that she isn't being supporting and is also taking it further by berating you and your choices instead of trying to come up with ways that she can join or help out. I was vegetarian when I started dating my ex-boyfriend and he was pretty great about not wanting me to stop my current diet, which I super appreciated. I ended up falling off the band-wagon because we loved cooking together and trying new things (a lot of meat involved) but I can't blame him for that - I made the choice to cave. I'm sure that if I had continued to be vege he would have continued to be supportive and we would have found foodie things to try that suited both diets. Maybe you can try something similar where you try to suggest some food-related things you can do together, like cooking classes or going out to eat at vegan places. I hope she becomes supportive and that you don't have to resort to breaking up with her. Good luck! ||||| Don't tell you to break up with an incredibly shallow, insecure, and controlling bitch?

Stalker & Glide/Xpress/Heat/Avenger SS - The Stalker should be your first choice - amazing disc.  The difference between the other 4 I mentioned is rim size/speed.  I'd go with an Xpress or a Heat to fill the understable control driver slot.  Nuke/Nuke OS - Either can be used for over-stable disc duties, but the OS is a beast.  I've seen some people with horrible form do okay with these because of how well it comes back from a wrist roll.  I use the OS for Thumbers or utility BH/FH. ||||| Avenger SS Comet Heat Stalker Wasp  Thats a much nicer pack than the reports I'm seeing of 4-5 Nukes in the box. ||||| What did you end up taking, op? ||||| Stalker. Jesus Christ take it now. Like the buzzz? Great, stalker is a longer buzzz. It sees your tunnel fairways and scoffs at them. I could make a strong case for this to be my flair disc.   Comet. If it does something weird consistently it's your fault. You will find mechanical flaws with it pretty quick. Versatile mid.  Glide, cuz there is one for both of you.  I like the Heat for ripping anhyzer lines and hyzer flipping, but I don't have the arm for higher speed discs that might do the same job better.  Wasp. I am looking at going all discraft next season and the wasp looks like a flat roc3. Yet to hold one yet, but reviews and such tell me this is where to to look first if I chose to move on from the roc3   If I was your friend and you took this list, I'd be friggen pissed btw.

And so forth.  Rarely is something of the same said back in response to me. The responses I get seem to indicate I have provoked negativity. It makes me feel bad because I say it with the intent of showing I enjoyed the game with them, not gloating the outcome.   I have tried "Thanks for the games" but if I won, it comes out sounding like "Thanks for the win" and the responses are about the same. I am just trying to be polite and respectful in victory or defeat but it seems like my words change meaning to my opponent based on which side of that outcome I am on.  Am I just not getting the etiquette?  ||||| Some people get irked by "gg"... I find that training myself to say "nice playing with you" or "good luck in the rest of your games" seems to rub fewer people the wrong way.   But, the thing to remember is: some people just hate losing. There are those who will be pissed no matter what is said. Don't let the minority stop you from being a good sport to the majority. ||||| Because it seems to be the norm, I avoid saying "good game" when I win, unless the loser offers it. Instead, I'd say "good luck in the next rounds" or something like that.   That being said, I wouldn't have a problem hearing "good game," even as the loser, if it was, quite simply, **good**. Did I lose due to a strong case of mana screw or flood? Did I lose because I made a big, boneheaded mistake, like not paying the cost of a Pact? Did I lose because it was the worst matchup possible for my deck in the entire meta? Or did I lose just because my deck did OK and my plan almost worked, but unfortunately for me, my opponent and his deck did just a little better - stayed on curve just one turn longer than me, topdecked just one more perfect answer, played a tiny bit better? If it's the last case, then sure, call it a good game, because it was. Having lost doesn't change that as long as I had fun doing it and made a good competition of it.  That doesn't give you a clear-cut rule of thumb, unfortunately, because not everyone is as honest, easygoing, and breathtakingly handsome as I am. Some people will take offense at any loss. In general, though, I wouldn't mind calling it a "good game" if it's interactive and very nearly even. ||||| I have this saved from a while ago.  I have no idea who posted it but it is the best advice I have ever read for post game etiquette.  "**If you win the game, you no longer have priority.**  This means, WAIT for your opponent to say something. If they say GG, you GG back. If THEY extend a hand, you extend you hand back to them. If they scoop and walk away silently, don't take it personally and just move on with your life.  If you go when you don't have priority, you look like a jackass. 99/100 times you are being a total dickhead.  If you say GG or extend a handshake after they flood out, or miss land drops, or any number of things like that, you are being an extreme dickhead.  **If you lose the game, you have priority, and several decision trees**  If applicable, congratulate your opponent on playing well. Feels good when people do this, it'll feel good when people do this to you. Wish them good luck going forward, it feels good and it'll feel good when people return the favor.  The generic comments like GG, Thank you for games, or good luck in the tournament are fine if you don't feel like they earned anything special but you still want to be friendly.  If you absolutely must, the appropriate way to complain about bad draws without sounding like a dickhead is sort of as follows. "I wish I could have had some better draws to give you better games! Good luck in your next round!" Try to smile or something & extend hand your hand while you say this.  **After the loser passes priority back to you**  If they thought they had shitty draws. Just agree with them no matter what. "Sorry about that man, good luck in the rest of the rounds. It doesn't matter if their draws were fine and their deck just sucks.  If things are going well [AND ITS A MINOR EVENT], and you thought you saw a major misplay or something, you can ask in a friendly way about a decision earlier in the game or give some advice, especially to new players. If its a major tournament, shut the fuck up. Nobody wants to hear that when they're emotionally invested and feeling bad, even if they did extend a hand and are trying their best to be friendly. They're also probably aware.  Most of the time though. Just return whatever they said to you, be it a handshake or a congratulation. " ||||| I can't believe how many players don't shake hands after matches.  We all hate losing, we all get mana screwed/flooded and we all lose to an opponent that gets perfect draws; it's Magic.  That being said, I let the losing player set the tone.  If he wants to be immature, I don't say anything and he can get up without shaking my hand.  I always extend my hand after losing a match because that's what I expect others to do.  Plus, it helps me shake off the loss by doing something respectful no matter how salty I am. ||||| Well, you're following step one of Good Human Behavior: You're starting by considering whether you're in the wrong rather than immediately jumping to 'It's his/her/their fault'. In this case though, it's really on them.  In general: Saying 'Good Game' is neutral, provided you don't somehow add an inflection that indicates you are saying it in a condescending way.  If you played in a fair manner and your opponent responds by blaming their deck loudly, that's because they are failing to meet basic etiquette standards, and that's their problem, not yours. ||||| This [article]([URL] was posted today.  It covers how players should act, what you are experiencing is unfortunately common.  People get upset about losses and have not matured enough to handle it properly.  While this trait is undesirable it is not uncommon in the magic community. ||||| "Thank you for playing Magic with me."   Not once have I had a negative response to that statement.  ||||| If you win, it's good form to wait until they say GG first and likewise if you lose, GG first. ||||| I just want to know why is it that "good game" is the shorthand for telling your opponent that you enjoyed beating them regardless of game quality. We've seen enough screenshots of the likes of Starcraft and MTGO to see GG is used plenty of times in a "I got you gloat gloat gloat" capacity.   I agree entirely that magic should be a civil affair where people can enjoy trying to take each other apart and remain respectful in equal measure, but people still need to think about what they are saying in the heat of the moment. Yes, I do mean heat. It might look like a dispassionate game played by automatons at times but people wouldn't be as hooked as they are if it didn't give them a rush to win.  People who win: Why do you need to say "good game" when the game was bad? If you want to be polite you can say one of a hundred things. Why say "That was a good game because I won and the quality of the game itself is secondary"? I'm sorry if you feel bad about winning in a shitty way, but why do you think the sentence that is the exact opposite of that will help? Or worse, are you just saying something because you feel you have to say something to be polite, which is about as insincere as it gets?  People who lose: Suck it up. Extend the hand. Allow your opponent to enjoy their moment even if they "didn't deserve it". Start taking apart your match to see if you could have done better. Ask about plays. Realise that if variance truly did you in (and it wasn't your lack of skill or poor deck building) the wheel comes back around. Stop tying your self worth into one match or one night and start looking at the long game. ||||| "Thanks for the game".  Can't go wrong. ||||| If it was actually a good game.....win or lose- I will be excited and usually say one of my favorite moments from the match....  Other then that....I will say "gg" after I get up to walk away......since people will bitch as op is describing.  I feel its good manners to say and its a habit from the old days that I just cant fix.  I play a bit of pokemon tcg online- and most players are very kind always saying gg to you or back at you  Just my experience.  ||||| I have never had a problem with this... ^because ^I ^don't ^win :C ||||| If my opponent lost because of variance like mana problems, instead of good game, I'll say something like, "I wish I'd have gotten to see what your deck does when it doesn't screw you over like that. I'll bet it can really go off!" Or I'll just commiserate with them on the bad draws and remind them that it's all just part of the game. I say this myself if I have similar issues.  If I lose, I try not to make excuses about it, and to break the ice and keep things from being awkward, I'll usually congratulate my opponent and thank them for the games. Then, if I'm fairly familiar with him/her, I'll tell them to keep my tiebreakers good. ;) ||||| I always add something on. Saying "Good game" by itself sounds shallow at best, and rude at worst. Say something like, "Good game man, your deck seems really solid." Adding that little bit pretty much guarantees they won't take it as rude. ||||| Yeah don't be the first to say Good Game if you just won. Losing feels bad, so I let the loser set the tone. If they're genial and say good game I'll say it back and if they were tight games I might say something like "You had me scared with those flyers." I'll generally just wish them luck in the next rounds, and if they're salty I'll vacate the area as quickly as possible.  If you're playing MTGO, I generally don't speak at all unless spoken to in a friendly manner. ||||| No, they aren't "getting" the etiquette. You're a mature, gracious adult and they are whiny little shits. The correct response to anyone taking offense to courtesy (which you're under no REAL obligation to show in the first place) is a firm, "Oh, well a mighty 'go fuck yourself' to you, as well." This applies everywhere, not just to Magic. ||||| Yeah, I stopped saying GG if I win unless my opponent says it first.  I will wait about 10 seconds and if they don't say anything I will offer my hand and say "Thanks for the games."  If I lose, I offer the GG. ||||| People need to grow the hell up. Boo-hoo, you top decked 3 lands in a row and lost. Guess what, it's called variance. We are all at its mercy regardless of who you are.   You knew full well GOING IN that variance was a major factor. All of our efforts to mitigate that by playing more copies of a card still don't change the fact that a large part of the game is luck of the draw.   You wanna beat yourself up about punting a game? Fine. Don't make someone else feel shitty for your mistake. Grow the fuck up, shake your opponents hand and say "good game". 5 year olds are expected to do it at the end of a t-ball game. Grown ass adults should be expected to at least have better manners than kindergarteners.     ||||| I typically say "thanks for the games", "it was nice playing with you", (ect). Good game kinda annoys me a little because it basically says "I am saying the bare minimum so I can not seem like a douche when I get up and stamper off"... GG is just more annoying. Although it doesn't both me if your friendly or stick around a bit. ||||| Just say "good luck next match" regardless of win or loss, it's much more neutral and people don't take offense to it often. ||||| Its massively rude to say GG to the person you just beat before they say it. Its like rubbing it in, I don't need to hear the person who just beat me say "good job!" ||||| I always thought it was common courtesy to allow the person who lost to say "gg". You don't risk being "rude" that way. ||||| You're just dealing with people that have poor sportsmanship. Saying "good game" after winning is just saying "good game." It would be poor etiquette if you said "Man, that was an easy game. You fucking sucked bro." Or, *maybe* if the game was just soooo terrible on their part, then it could possibly be misunderstood as being rude, but that's not your fault. I would often beat my friend 9-1 every time we played for a few months, then he would beat me 9-1 for a few months. I always had fun, and so did he. We would say "good game" after every game, smoke a bowl, and play another. If someone gets upset at you for losing, that's their problem. Sure, you shouldn't instigate or provoke them, but saying "gg" is a far cry from being a dick.   It just might be that you, and I know I've had this problem, may be speaking in a manner that could be construed as "sarcastic" or "condescending". But, I would only think that that's the issue if you encounter negative types of responses in all walks of life, such as school, work, friends and strangers.   Keep enjoying your game, win or lose. I know I always have. ||||| I know what you mean by this. I once said gg and tried a handshake to a veteran player in our area after beating him and he got very annoyed/mad and said "how dare you" then left the store. It just  happens i guess.  I don't know why so many people get irked at gg but it tends to happen a lot. i know i might say "if only i had mana" but i will always say and mean gg when someone says it to me or I to them. ||||| Usually in situations like this you have to know if the game actually WAS a good game.  If their deck didn't perform, as in they got land screwed or flooded, GG is more likely seen as rude.  If they were good games, say good game.  If your opponent looks frustrated, maybe just let them make the first interaction after the game? ||||| When I genuinely lose cuz I get mana flooded I say something but I don't say it with any negativity I'm simply saying it because I In fact got mana flooded and that's the reason I didn't do anything in the game

3636	1,3,2,3,2,2,3	24	Hiya! My name's Anastasia, but most of the people that know me here and in the skype group call me nankazz or kittenkazz. I'm a newbie at conlanging, but it's an activity I really enjoy.   If you've been able to reach this point without boring your skulls out, i'll talk a little about it.  Lately I've been working on my language a lot. It used to be called Arizijin [a.ɾi.zi.ʒin], which became Arijzijin [a.ɾi:.zi:.in], then [a.ɾaj.zaj.in]. It was originally meant to be an a posteriori auxlang based on spanish, english, french, japanese, chinese, and russian. I'd pick the most commonly repeated, and sometimes words from different languages were united. If none of the words were similar in different languages, I wouldn pick the shortest or nicest one. It failed, however, and became a kitchen-sink relex. It looked something like this:  Boku taberu die zeitik.  1sg eat the newspaper (sorry for improper glossing)  I was (kind of) happy with it, but i got tired, as creating words was long  and boring. You had to look up words in 5 languages just to choose one. I also realized my method was flawed, so I decided to give it another go, and start over.  I decided to switch from an isolating language to a synthetic one, and started to switch from a posteriori to a priori. The language reached a point in which it stopped being an auxlang, and became a sort of artlang(I really don't know what the hell it was back then). I even tried oligosynthesis for a while, but I realized I wouldn't be able to express myself correctly using a small amount of words. It had become the Arai language [a.ɾaj]. It looked like this:  Ik essen die zeitung  1sg eat the newspaper.  After that, it evolved into nowadays ixiKyinn thanks to adoption of sino-japanese logograms, the creation of new terms, and the creation of case [i.ʃi.kyin:].  Its features:   - Not very naturalistic compared to many languages.  - Isn't pro-drop  - Verb conjugations are very simple, they only decline according to verb tense. There aren't different endings for different pronouns.  Asshi enukyoken hairahyekain(I.NOM eat newspaper.ACC), Ni enukyoken hairahyekain (You.NOM eat newspaper.ACC), Lan enukyoken hairahyekain(We.NOM eat newspaper.ACC), etc.  - Few phonemes: /a b d e f g h i j k l m n o ɾ s t u w ʃ z ʒ/ (There might be more phones, but I haven't noticed if there are any)  - Few logograms (300~400)  - Heavy compounding (stairs are 下歩何 "anagenka" down-walk-thing)  - A very strange hybrid righting system (mixes man'yōgana (japanese phonetic reading of chinese logographs) and normal sino-japanese logograms)  - Nominative-Accusative alignment (it probably doesn't even work like that, but i managed to make it kinda work.)  - Head-final.  Well, I'd love to write more, but this has become a wall of text, and due to me not knowing too much about linguistics, I seriously don't know what else I could say. Currently I'm working on writing a dictionary and a grammar book, I might even write a book for learning the language! In regards to my knowledge of the language, I'm probably an A2.   If you have any questions about the language, feel free to ask!  EDIT: now, ixiKyinn has a subreddit! /r/ixiKyinn ||||| Well this is interesting. And I know Japanese is Nom Acc as far as case alignment goes. But you say you mix the kana of Japanese with logograms. It sounded alien at first until I realized that's exactly what Japanese does.   This is pretty interesting. And I think we've all been there with first projects going wrong. Also I don't exactly know how to edit it, but there should be a flair for this as a conlang so people know.  What other cases exist? Are they expressed on the word or with a particle?  ||||| What does the name mean? At first glance, I thought this was going to be a Bantu inspired lang. (isiZulu and isiXhosa have a pretty similar form) ||||| Hey, just to let you know, I think you have a typo in your flair (I'm seeing isi instead of ixi). ||||| You say it's head-final, but the verbs all come before their objects in your examples. How do you explain that? Or is it just chocked up to being "not very naturalistic"? ||||| Looks good so far! Do you mark any cases?   **EDIT:** Oh wait you answered this in another comment haha. Do you have any examples with glosses?  ||||| Cool, and welcome!

Those are the places that are actually selling (and have on site) the vehicle.  ||||| [URL]  This might be what you're looking for. ||||| They're legit for the most part. it's just a way for salvage lots from different states/cities to expand their business and be able to reach out to more possible customers. You'll see cars for extremely low prices because for the most part, the cost of repairs became more than the car was worth for the majority of them. Understand that if you buy one, even if it only has minor damage, it's still a salvage title car, so you will get virtually nothing for it once/if  you decide to sell it.  I would personally stay away from any salvage vehicle because the return on investment will always be poor, and the car could have airbags that won't deploy in the case of an accident because they weren't replaced from what I've heard. ||||| What?

3042	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	27	Now I don't think I'm in the position to call it depression because, even though most would call it depression, I've never been diagnosed with anything. It's become an immense problem ever since I first started lifting a few years ago. It's a problem because when it comes to dieting and lifting, without fail, I get in a funk that I like to call a "fuck everything/not worth it" mindset. On my third week of a diet? Fuck it why am i even doing this. I'm gunna eat what i want. My biggest problem is body fat, and as everyone knows that is one of the most important aspects of bodybuilding. When I get into this funk it just completely destroys any diet I'm on, any lifting routine I'm currently doing. Now i am not making an excuse for my poor willpower, but as everyone reading this knows, bodybuilding is one of the most taxing challenges anybody can put themselves through, and i feel like its even harder than it should be for me. Has anybody experienced this? I'm not looking for upvotes or downvotes. I'm simply looking for someone who has gone through this shit, or is currently. I just need to feel like its not impossible to deal with this. Would anyone like to share? ||||| this plan is fool proof and proven to work. For everytime you eat at home eat shirtless infront of a mirror. while listening to moonlight sonata. If you dont lose wait doing this you are immortal. [URL]   ALL SERIOUS THO WATCH THIS VIDEO AND THAN TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT TO BE. ONLY YOU CAN BE THE CHANGE [URL] ||||| Probably, and this is just my theory, you don't handle glycogen depletion very well. Willpower requires sugar, and if you're cutting, you aren't getting enough. In addition, being glycogen depleted makes me feel like shit. I suggest that every 2-3 weeks (since this is when it hits you), you have a targeted carbohydrate refeed. Have no alcohol during the refeed.   In theory, you could just eat more carbs each day during the diet and you wouldn't need to refeed, but that might not be as fun as eating 400-1000g carbs in 1 day. How many hours per day do you exercise (on average) and how many grams of carbs per day do you eat when you are cutting?   1. About glycogen, willpower, and alcohol. [[URL] 2. About glycogen depletion and body mass. [[URL] ||||| I know many who have gone through it.  I quite frequently did when I was younger (13-17).  I can't speak for depression, as my best friend in the world battles with it and through literally hundreds of conversations and strategies we'd come up with together, he still struggles with maintaining a continuous path along any major goal he sets.  On a positive note, after a move cross-country, a little growing up, and some life experience, he is absolutely getting better and is finding his path in life.  Now for my experience, I was able to crawl up out of my hole in high school.  I got extraordinarily lucky.  I never talked to anyone or researched my funk.  I simply came to the conclusion on the second day of my junior year in high school  (specific, I know, but it was a moment for me) that if I did not choose to both change and more importantly commit to my change, nothing would change.  And with that, I found the sharpest tool in my arsenal - visualization.  I visualized failure.  At the time failure for me meant not getting into college.  I spent two weeks contemplating what this meant, day after day, until it consciously no longer was an option to do quit.  I slaughtered myself studying, every single day.  And I was scared up until the day I got my first acceptance letter.  But guess what - I didn't get into the school I wanted.  Again, a failure I visualized and committed to not allowing.  I killed myself my freshman year at my university to transfer.  Two semesters later I realized I was happy where I was, but nonetheless the progress I had made was enough to keep me going.  I continued to visualize success and failure, and told myself under no circumstance could I allow for failure or settle for anything less than success.  Took me all the way through my collegiate experience and my start of lifting.  I'm really sorry if the above seemed like a story about me.  The only thing I wanted to communicate was what worked for me in getting out a funk.  It was training my mind to visualize success and failure.  Visualize what you want to look like - make it crystal clear, but don't stop there.  Search your mind long and hard for why you want to look like that.  And then commit to it no longer being an option, but a necessity to meet that goal if you believe that's what truly will make you happy (and I think it will).  Once you've committed to that, don't let your mind ever tell you otherwise.  Train your mind.  Eventually, once the thought of making it to the gym (or studying, or sticking to your diet, etc...) no longer becomes an option, but an absolutely essential element of your day and life that you structure everything ELSE around, then you've made it.    That's what worked for me anyways.  Visualize success, and how it can only be achieved by sticking to to that commitment.  Visualize failure, and what it means to give in.  Be fully prepared, because that desire to quit on rough days never goes away, but it sure as hell gets easier to squelch, every single day.  The longer you go without giving up, the more it becomes a part of your life.  Soon, it is your life.    Keep on truckin man. ||||| I occasionally feel really, super depressed as well... I can say that eating squeaky clean and getting TONS of quality sleep are the most important things for me. If I make sleep my # 1 priority, I feel 100 x better. If I lose even a night of sleep I can be depressed for days... and it's a terrible downward spiral, like "Why go to bed, I don't give a shit about tomorrow..."  I also definitely agree with the comment below re: glycogen. Your mood is certainly a function of chemicals in your brain, and the chemicals in your brain are definitely affected by what you eat. Do some experimenting. I personally feel a lot better on a strict paleo diet - check it out and give it a go, maybe. ||||| You could be referring to what Jamie Lewis calls the Dark Period.

It sucked. I would cry for absolutely no reason at all. Low bodyfat messes with your hormones. ||||| When I'm dieting sometimes I literally have to ask myself aloud, "Do you want this more than you want to feel good, right now?" The answer is always yes. If your answer isn't yes, then that doesn't necessarily mean bodybuilding isn't for you, but it means bodybuilding *the way you're doing it isn't working for you*.   If body fat is a problem for you, my guess is you've never experienced the excitement of waking up one morning halfway into your diet and seeing abdominal muscles poking through the last remaining belly fat. Or the pure fucking elation of waking up 3-4 weeks later and seeing veins up your adonis belt, and a hard defined six pack. My point is if you were familiar with the feeling of just sitting back and enjoying the achievement of your own goals, the "fuck this it's not worth it" mentality wouldn't even come to your mind. You'd know what "it" is and you'd know that "it" is most definitely worth it.   So there's some great advice in this thread about carb cycling, replenishing your glycogen stores, etc., but I'd be remiss if I didn't emphasize the importance of setting reasonable goals *that you can see in the mirror*, and that would excite you. You'll need to buckle down through this first goal - whatever it is - and just trust me that it's so worth it (this is one former fat kid to another - it's fucking worth it, my man). After you *feel* how goddamned awesome it is to see that you've done what you set out to do, it'll be so much easier the next time you're three weeks in and in a funk to remind yourself of what that experience is like of achieving that which you already know is attainable.  ||||| Deep down you need to tell yourself that you're worth it and that you want it. You can do it - it's just about how bad you want it. You deserve it if you go after it.

3398	1,3	4	I posted a long description in [startups]([URL] but to summarize (actually, describe in detail but differently), i work at a pre-launch small startup and 2/6 employees are partly tasked with making everyone work more. The founder and shot-caller lives in another state. It's frustrating that they don't appreciate the work I do every day. It seems like they don't see the trees for the forest (i.e. they see only the big picture, not the details) and as an effect there's this perpetual pressure to work more. When interviewing, they said it was *fine* to work only 40 hours, but *some people* worked all the time and they would *like* if I worked more. It turns out that programming is quite draining, for example I'd presume that nearly everyone takes 2-3 hours during the day when they're not writing code or aren't at the computer. I program as a hobby / educationally so I could totally dedicate 50+ hours per week to a project if it was something I was passionate about. I don't  have it in me for this job, though, especially because the team dynamics are frequently counterproductive. I think there's pressure disseminating from the 'big boss' which sours the office atmosphere. Everyone is defensive.   Anyway, I get that its a startup. I've been told pressure is inherent, but I don't believe this. If they needed people to work more than 40 hours per week as a company requirement, they should have hired more people. Otherwise, the management needs to improve, which is the case here.  Let me explain about the management. The other coders on the team seem to be under a lot of pressure. There are only two managers in the office, though, the two 'underbosses', who either don't write code or are bad at talking about code. I think the other coders are under similar pressure as I am to work longer hours, but whereas I write the backend (data), they write the mobile applications which are far more frequently and harshly criticized by users and their superiors. At this point I'm working in parity with them, and it really seems unnecessary for me to work more than 40 hours a week. Working from home, I could get the same job done in 30 hours a week, even less if they were better at writing specifications and collaborating.   They were incessantly pressuring me to work 45 hours at the office each week, but I firmly resisted and they've dropped that requirement for me only. Now, since one of the 'underbosses' errantly let the team the take black friday off, we apparently have to 'make up' for it by working sunday. I was going to work a few hours today (saturday) but this spoiled my enthusiasm.   Part of me wants to give them an ultimatum, because I don't think it's worth it for me for this pressure to linger. It it wasn't for the pressure to work longer hours (when the job doesnt really require that many), I would be happy to stick with it because I have a good equity investment in the company.    ||||| Ultimatum will cause them to look for another person.  It sounds like they think you are replaceable.  Be pro-active & look elsewhere for a job.  If you have an equity investment, then it makes sense why they expect you to work additional hours.  Your salary + equity = true salary.  That is a very good reason to stick around especially if you have reason to believe this company will grow quickly.  edit: Honestly, you're going to rarely find a salary position that is strictly 40 hours / week.  Some weeks will be 80+ hours & others will be 5-10 hours.  Especially when you're dealing with bad management.  If you have the "balls" you can talk to big boss about how an additional programmer will boost productivity and/or methods to boost productivity & savings.  You'd have to outline it clearly so that they see $$$ savings.

Nope, there isn't. Also, you need the special WiFi enabled Desmume. You can't just do it with any version, as they removed WiFi capability.

2797	1,3,3,3,3	13	I'm learning clawhammer as a side hobby, and I've been progressing very well. However, I've hit a wall. I have absolutely zero problem playing hammer-ons, pull-offs, fooling around and freestyling, if you will, within the context of the bum-ditty. But I can't play songs!  1. I can't play quarter note rolls  2. I can't integrate the melody into the rhythm  This song is a perfect example ([I'll fly away]([URL] Extremely basic melody - no problem there. But I can't put the melody into the bum-ditty! I don't understand how they sync up and it is extraordinarily frustrating.   I lose it at exactly 2:19. It goes from extremely basic non-music to mind bogglingly confusing. Any help will be greatly appreciated! ||||| I've been playing clawhammer banjo for like 40+ years (a frightening thought!) and I honestly could not learn a tune from that video.  Not saying it's a bad video, just that my brain doesn't learn that way. For starters, banjo is first a *rhythm* instrument. One can play very melodically but the foundation is the rhythm not the melody. When I get super fancy (for me) - lots up the neck etc I'm still basically playing a rhythmic pattern and the notes are supporting the rhythm not the other way around. It wasn't until I started fiddle a few years ago that I realized that the actual notes matter -  because on the fiddle they do (a lot) but on the banjo they don't so much.  So if I were learning this, I'd find a sample or teacher that started with a super-simple rhythm. Bum ditty is fine. Just play simple chords, just close enough to sing along. Add one or two - no more - melody notes here and there. Then, play the crap out of it until it's second nature. Then, add one or two more melody notes, and play the crap out if that for a while.   For me, "a while" usually means days, weeks even months - for others more talented an hour or two should suffice.   The idea is that it should be enjoyable - it should *feel* like you're playing the song, instead of feeling like a science project.   ||||| I'm not sure if I'm understanding correctly. But I've always had a hard time learning from videos. I really find playing from tab to be the best way to learn a song. Check out mike inverson's clawhammer tab website. There are tons of great beginning songs on there.  Edit: here is the link  [URL] ||||| Clawhammer does have a rhythm portion, but it's much more melodic than 2 finger (which it sounds like you're coming from).   Focus on playing the melodies first.  The ornamental notes in between can come much later.  You're not doing rolls, but playing a song with notes in order.  It's okay to have full quarter notes, skip the ditty and just hold for the melody.  You don't need to keep pounding on the bum ditty if it doesn't fit the song.  Strip it down, play the melody, and only add in the extra notes when needed.  This is where good tab helps... it helps see where people are adding and subtracting.   ||||| Try to use your ears more. Dont watch someone explain it. Find a version of the song you like, and just listen to it a lot.   The bum is going to be your melody note. The ditty is going to be the "strum/thumb". In some spots in this song, you play a few melody notes without bum dittying.

7531	1,3,2,3	5	I didn't really know in which subreddit to post this so I hope this is the right one. If not, just let me know and I can move it.   So I'm just going to start out by saying I got the short end of the stick when it comes to mental health. I've been diagnosed bipolar 2 along with BPD, and I had an abusive relationship in the past which still weighs on me heavily sometimes.   So my boyfriend is pretty much the best SO you can have. He's intelligent, funny, and we share a lot of the same interests. We've been friends since we were children so we know each other very well, and he never treats me with anything but love and respect. We've been dating for almost 2 years now. I know that we are young but we share a very deep bond, especially because he's been so understanding with all of my mental problems.   The problem comes from my side. People with BPD are known to have separation anxiety when it comes to their SOs. I've realized that when we haven't spent physical time together I get very moody. I feel like I always want to be physically close to him. And I know that it's impossible to be next to him all the time, but I still want it. We just came back from a week-long vacation with his family (they've become my second family and I love them), and I'm taking not being with him every second really hard. I miss falling asleep next to him and I just feel so lonely. I'm tearing up writing this and I don't even know why.   So I need your help, Reddit. I don't want to be the clingy girlfriend, but I really don't know how to cope with not being physically close to him. The last thing I want to do is trap him, especially because he's a very free, happy-go-lucky guy. What do I do?  Also yes, I have communicated a lot of this to him. He's very good and stays relatively close to me in public settings because I can get overwhelmed and when I'm sad he just hugs me. He knows that's what I need to feel loved. But I don't think he knows the full extent of this.   TL;DR: I've basically got the best damn boyfriend ever but I don't know how to cope with being away from him.   ||||| I know it's very easy to "cling" and want to be around someone 24/7, but try to remember that time alone is also good for you, and it makes the time you spend with him more special.   I know what you mean, and I know the exact feeling you're describing, because I've experienced it--I think it's pretty common, and admitting to it means you know it's an issue for you, so you should work on it. For me, I'll distract myself when the guy isn't around, and I'll tell myself I can only check my phone once every half hour or so.   I'll give myself tasks, like organizing my room, cleaning the bathroom, getting homework done, etc. Things that need to get done anyway, and require my full attention. It keeps me distracted, and makes me more productive! Anything that keeps you from being on your phone (checking it, or blowing his up) is a good thing!  Try getting lost in a good book, starting a new series on Netflix, or hanging out with some other friends. A shopping trip by yourself can be a good way to unwind, too. If possible, pick up extra hours at work--this means more money for you, and less time to blow his phone up or overthink anything.  I'm glad you have an understanding boyfriend, but remember, smothering anyone will eventually take its toll. Healthy relationships require some amount of distance--even married couples need their own time sometimes. Give yourselves time to miss each other. I hope I could help in some way. :) Best of luck! ||||| To be honest, dealing with your mental health is very much more important right now than whether you have a boyfriend.  I mean VERY much more important.  You have BPD and a history of abusive relationships.  Are you in counseling?  Are you at least taking your prescribed medication?   ||||| As a former "happy-go-lucky guy" to someone with BPD, I'm just gunna honestly say talk to a/you're doctor. It's what that are their for and their gunna know YOU and what's going on in you're life better than reddit! I can tell that you really don't want to be the "stage 5 clinger!" And I can tell you really care for him, so please do what my ex didn't and talk to you're doctor! This is a common thing and with  everything you've been through the doctor will easily understand and will help you find a HEALTHY way of dealing with it.

With TTNG, the guitarist is pretty nuts with his tapping and fingerpicking chops, but also the 'bass player' is very impressive. He plays a modified 6 string bass, and he does the work of 3 people. Literally. He switches between playing bass parts and guitar parts that were intended to be played without singing, all while singing at the same time. He's replacing a singer, bass player, and guitarist who all left the band.   Mylets does some pretty nuts guitar work, but also his use of effects and loop pedals is fucking groundbreaking.    ||||| I still consider most of Deloused in the Comatorium by The Mars Volta to be pretty unique. Omar in general is just nuts. Check out Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt  Edit: the studio version typically sound better than the live one's (lyrically at least) ||||| I'm into post unique myself. ||||| In what way? Fucked Up bring some experimental many-guitar-ness to what might be glancing-ly dismissed as hardcore.  Diarrhea Planet also have way too many guitarists going at once giving their sound a hugeness that I find compelling.  Sonic Nurse era Sonic Youth had 3 guitars plus bass and drums making for dynamic goodness. ||||| Define unique? Should being unique be the goal of every guitarist? When you say "unique", are you talking about entirely new forms of music, new genres or are you talking about the more subtle uniqueness that can come from artists in existing genres?    Does sticking to a genre's established style make you generic?    These are all important questions that you should probably think about, being unique is a good thing for a artist but being unique is not a "black and white", binary affair, one can be unique in more subtle ways that you may simply not have the knowledge or context to detect.    For example, your dismissal of the blues players (in a arrogantly offhanded way I might add) as "generic" is interesting because there are a ton of blues guitarists out there and not one sounds like the other in all reality, each has their own style, their own method of phrasing, their own distinct voice. If you are not really into the genre, you might simply not be able to detect those differences due to lack of interest.    To some people, all classical music kinda sounds the same, they are the ones that might say that one composer is "generic" simply because they don't actually understand or can't recognize what makes that composer different from the rest.    The other thing that often comes to play in the whole "unique" or "innovative" conversation is bias, if you don't like the blues or jazz or even heavy metal, you are clearly not going to spend the time and effort required to learn what makes each artist in those genre's unique just as someone else might call your favorite genre's "generic" if they simply don't understand the genre as a whole.    The final thing I want to talk about is the preservation of genres, there are always going to be guitarists that are more like historians, they are deeply interested in existing styles and sub-genre's and will actively try to preserve those genre's by playing them in their traditional forms, funny enough, even these players can be unique, as I said before, you won't find two guitar players that play exactly alike and many of those "historians" are going to add their own little things here and there simply because that is what artists do.    Not every guitarist needs to be the musical equivalent of Chuck Yeager as he broke the sound barrier in the X-1, some folks find more subtle ways to have their own voice, you may not hear those subtle elements if you are simply not interested in the genre to being with.    In other words, try not to be so dismissive. ||||| If its not broken, dont fix it

1585	1,3,3	4	I just got a rescue from our local shelter on Sunday he was found tied up outside the shelter very emaciated and ~60 lbs. He is finally starting to get some energy back and feeling better but he is puppy mouthing in a big way. I am working with him doing the ouch and turn away/time out method and I am making some progress but I was wondering if any one had more experience with Mastiffs to let me know if this is a common breed trait. The age is a pure guess by the staff at the shelter and he is showing puppy behaviors finally.  I do behavior remediation for our shelter but I mostly work with pitties, younger pups and my first mastiff was over 2 years old when we got her. I am doing standard impulse control protocols with him and he is responding I was more curious on if late mouthing was a common trait with these guys or if alternative methods might be a better fit for the breed.  ||||| I would say this is common in dogs in general that were not taught what was acceptable forms of interaction and play. With the way that he was rescued, it does not sound like he was given much if any training at all. I think your current method is a good one, and you said you are seeing progress. It may take awhile depending on how stubborn your boy is and how consistent you are with it.   A good addition to this is training "gentle." I use small high value treats in a closed hand and when they start to lick rather than use teeth they get the treat. This can be a bit painful at first, but works well in my experience. It can also double and help them have a softer mouth for when they forget themselves and use their mouth while playing.  ||||| My English has never once displayed a mouthing behavior. None of the other Mastiff's I have ever met (10+) ever displayed a mouthing behavior. I haven't heard of it associated with the breed before, but I'm always open to being corrected.  Hope that helped!  My mastiff does like to chew though. She shreds through tennis balls when she's done playing fetch. I give her giant cow knuckle bones from the meat market to chew on. (not the smaller ones or she will swallow them whole)

6739	1,3,3	6	In the fall of 2013, I was a sophomore in college and had just gotten into drinking/partying. For the most part, it was harmless and I'd only drink on the weekends and let loose a little (I am a very socially anxious person, so the lack of inhibition was very appealing to me). One weekend I made out with a friend of mine at a party. However, this person was very drunk (probably blackout level; they had a drinking problem and did this frequently), and I knew they weren't really into me. I asked if it was okay, but I know someone can't consent while drunk. I did this the following weekend as well. After that, I went on with my life and didn't think much of it for a while. My other friends, who were also friends with said person, became much more distant in the following weeks. I was a little curious about it, but I figured it was just that people grow apart and sometimes friendships don't last. However, I later found out later that those friends weren't hanging out with me because the friend that I made out with didn't feel comfortable around me. I apologized to the person over text message, but didn't get  a reply and never spoke to them again. I feel like a terrible person, even now two+ years later. I feel like I took advantage of them because I knew they would be more likely to say yes while drunk, and because I knew they weren't really into me. The person has blocked me on Facebook and I feel like I've really hurt them and I don't know what to do about it. Am I blowing things out of proportion? I feel like I sexually assaulted them even though we didn't do anything more than make out. Every time I remember that this happened, it hits me like a ton of bricks and I sink into depression.

4896	1,3,3,3,3	6	I just received my PS3 today. I believe it is an Ultra Slim. I can't get it to connect to my house's wi-fi. I know my SSID and password, I can connect on my laptop just fine. But on the PS3, after selecting the SSID, it looks like it asks me for the type of password or encryption? I know the password, and I tried all three options, but I can't get it to work. Help please? ||||| I don't have an answer for you, but here's an upvote.  I hope that you find someone to help you.  ||||| If you have a newer router chances are it is WPA2 for the security option. WEP if it's older. You can probably get more help at /r/techsupport ||||| You may want to check your router settings to make sure you do not have "**MAC Filtering**" on. If this is on, even knowing the right password won't allow you to connect, since your Media Access Control (MAC) on your PS3 isn't listed with your router.  On a computer logged into your network, you can usually go to [URL] or [URL] in your browser to log into your router.  If that doesn't work, Google your router type to see what the default internal IP is for your Admin interface. ||||| Well from the sound of it you need to know the type or encryption your WiFi connection has on its signal. The easiest way to find that out is to scan for networks again and next to the name of the WiFi connection you want to use it will state one of the following WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK, or WPA2. After you know that select the connection and enter the password with the correct packet encryption.
3574	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	27	Hey guys,  Basically I recently became the owner of a 360, and with it I bought GoW3 and Black Ops. I've tried playing Black Ops but get owned so hard due to know skills with the controller and not having a clue of the maps. I used to play the original CoD back in 2005 and MW2 on launch, but on PC.  I'm basically looking for people to game with as I have 2 friends that play on xbox. If you fancy helping a newb out, or just someone to game with, add my gamertag - Drazilek  I'm from the UK, but lag permitting I'll game with anyone.  ||||| SIMONSAYSURDEAD- I play everyday.  ||||| Play domination to learn the maps  Sleight ofhand, ghost & hacker |||||  Watch kill cams when you keep getting owned and learn the lil tricks of every map. Switch up ur perks and try all the guns. Dont limit ur self to just a few of the many classes u can create. experiment. Cheers.   ||||| My advice is to read up some tips from here, like that you'll get better. Don't get discourage when playing black ops like I did. I took almost 6 months before, and committed to getting better and now my K/D is at 1.67.The best advice I can give you is don't run into corners period. That the best advice there is. Two, stay outside the map to scope some easy kills.  Three, love the iron sight, Galil and Famas have the best overall iron sight. And use the suppressors, it keeps you alive the longer. Four, the best kill streak hands down is the blackbird.  Five, UAV wins the game. Six, launchers; use them take to take out the Choppers and Helicopters, that help out a lot more then you think. Seven, Switch to tactical on the control layout, 7 out of 10 times a drop shot works like fucking magic. Eight, Claymores and motion sensor baby.   ||||| Hoarmoans. I play dom, mostly but I'm open to anything ||||| I play often. Will likely play tonight. Gamertag: Eurhmhom. Normally play TDM or Demolition.  ||||| I would look for some tip videos on youtube. Most of the people have moved on to MW3 but just search for blackops vids on their channel. I would recommend Woodysgamertag, Blametruth, Xcalizors, LegendofThunder. They will give you gun and perk tips, and map analysis. Should help a lot  ||||| xREETz. Add me and we'll smash this shit. Have you bought any map packs? ||||| Three words:  Ghost and Suppressor. ||||| Something that might help you is when you play in a lobby and one player completely dominates (15-0,20-1. etc) go to their player card and go to their recent games.  Add their latest game to your file share and then you can go to theater and watch their play style and the spots on the map that they used to win.

9050	1,3	5	My family was fairy sick over the weekend and never had the chance to go see the Hobbit. We finally have the time to make this happen. We really wanted to see it in 48FPS. The websites are now exceptionally vague about what kind of 3D they're showing. I called up Silvercity Coquitlam and they said they were no longer showing it in HFR. Langley Collossus isn't picking up the phone.  I suspect I'm out of luck here - am I?  EDIT: looks like it's still in Richmond! ||||| I can tell you I found the movie almost completely unwatchable at 48fps. If you've seen a TV with TruMotion/MotionFlow/etc (where they interpolate the "missing" from 24 or 30 fps upto 60/120/240) - that's what you get for 2.5 hours. I couldn't stand it, but if you're into it then go nuts. If you're not, then you might just as well see it in 24fps like every other amazingly shot movie you've ever seen.  I would try the Scotiabank Theatre downtown, or one of the big Silver Cities. You may have to call to get a straight answer, though.
3634	1,3	19	I've spent a few years running in circles with little ideas and never going very far. There are a lot of sources and tutorials for making conlangs, with a variety of approaches and focuses (foci?). Likewise, there are many kinds of conlangs and conlangers. So I figure I may do better if I seek more personal advice.  So, first my language. I'm interested in devising a language that follows as consistent of rules as possible in all areas, at least as a first draft. No associated world. More of an engineered language than anything. Perhaps like Ithquil, but very different phonologically, more isolating morphologically (but with still some fusion), and with a much freer word order.  Phonetics and phonology are the areas where I am least formally educated, so they will pose a lot of problems for my language. But in general, I want to include as many sounds as possible, even some that are not commonly marked in IPA, such as a "whistled" s and z, made apically, or with the very tip of the tongue. Dark l, lezh, pretty much any sound I can figure out how to pronounce and tell apart should be mark its own phoneme. My first draft will probably not distinguish aspiration of consonants, but I'd like to work that in later. In the end phonemes should be as close to individuals sounds/phones as possible. Noise-sensitivity be damned. But that's just consonants. For vowels, I'm less certain. It is much harder for me to tell apart the various front+rounded sounds, so I'm not sure how many I want. I do want rhoticized and nasalized vowels though. I would also like many diphthongs and triphthongs, but am not sure which combinations are discernible and pronounceable, or how best to test and record the combinations.  Phonology I definitely need help with. I would like to have many syllabic consonants, including all nasals and fricatives, but, as with di-/triphthongs, am uncertain about how to deal with all the combinations. **This and diphthongs are my main stumbling blocks so far.**  Now case, pronouns, and reference. I would like to have a lot of cases, in a system that basically subsumes all adpositions and special adverbs (like English "away"). Word order being free, all cases should be marked (or dropped and implied), and the markings should be generally consistent in meaning, so nothing like passive sentences. This is called semantic or active-stative alignment, [according to Wikipedia]([URL] Reference material on prepositions, semantic roles, and cases would be appreciated.  For pronouns, reference, and deixis, I have some ideas. I would like lots of pronoun drop, like Chinese. I would also like many ways to refer to elements and patterns of discourse. Can anyone suggest decent references for discourse analysis, structure, reference, etc.?  And now for me. I have formally studied linguistics, but just a little. I've completed an intro course, then basic syntax & morphology, then dropped phonetics & phonology because the instructor expected large thorough projects and held the opinion that "sleep is for the weak." Then I took two more advanced courses (my favorites so far), on semantics and pragmatics. Then most recently I took corpus building/analysis and advanced syntax courses. I'm not sure how to quantify what all I took away from these, but it should give linguists w/ academic experience an idea of where I am.  I hope that's not too awfully long. Thanks for reading. I welcome all responses: questions, comments, criticism, whatever. ||||| Having every sound you can pronounce in the phonemic inventory of the language is a rookie mistake, it'll sound awful.

1009	1,2,3,2	18	I've hit one of those creative walls where I can't think of any backstory for my character, so I was wondering if anyone had good ideas. My character is a massive gold dragonborn named Torinn he wields a glaive and he has a vertical scar over his left eye.

What is his profession?  How did he get the scar?  Why is he so massive?  What does "Torinn" mean in his culture?  Why does he prefer a glaive?  When did he first pick one up?  What is special about the one he carries?  Does he know other dragonborn?  Is he friends with any of different colors?  Does he need help with anything?  Does he need money?  Why does he rage?  Is it an angry rage, or a controlled release of pent up power?

6157	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	13	Just a quick plea for help.  I have typically been a 4-5 pepsi a day drinker (some days more, but almost never less), and today I went cold turkey.  I am absolutely dying.  I also tend to be quite a sugar hound, and I'm trying to kind of go scorched earth on it all because I have moderation issues apparently.  I don't drink coffee or tea, so now I am really struggling with just stabbing headaches.  Any suggestions for how to make it through? ||||| Caffeine withdrawal is a bitch.  I've dropped it a few times, and the only way to deal with the headaches are: 1) taper down slowly instead of going cold turkey 2) just deal with the 2 weeks of feeling like garbage until it's over.  Nothing else seems to touch those headaches.  If you can't go back to soda, then midol and migraine relief meds tend to have some caffeine in them (check the box) and you can use those on a limited basis to taper yourself down and get through the headaches.   ||||| acetaminophen (Tylenol) -- should take 3 days   ||||| Water and patience. Gum has a small amount of sugar that could get you through, but your willpower for moderation needs some training. Good luck. ||||| sugar withdrawal and caffeine withdrawal at the same time? Wow. Braver than me. keep yourself hydrated and good luck. ||||| I tried to cold turkey cut coffee and the headaches got to me.  After two weeks, with neither tylenol nor ibuprofin helping, I started adding in a cup... but only every other day.  Then two days without.  Now I have no headaches and haven't had coffee since... Thursday?  It's week four.  So as bad as that sugar is for you, wean yourself down slowly.   ||||| It's simple withdrawal. You'll have to gut it out and it'll pass.  ||||| For caffeine plain coffee works, or black tea.  Almost 0 cal too. ||||| I would cut down the caffeine gradually. Caffeine withdrawal is seriously awful. I went cold turkey 10 years ago and thought I was going to die. I even had to call out of work.  ||||| Everyone says it takes a few days to get past this. I was a caffeine addict like you. Took me close to 2 weeks to get past the headaches. But, once you get past it, you will feel great. Time to cowboy up, deal with the discomfort.

6044	1,3,3,3	25	Over on /r/sysadmin there is a post trending about an admin who intended to wipe a single server or drive, and accidentally deleted (probably permanently) the entire company server infrastructure, including all backups.  [Link to discussion]([URL]  Assuming there are no tape or paper backups, this admin could have basically destroyed his entire company's information, resources, everything.  Is that grounds for a company to somehow take legal action against the employee in some way? I don't really know exactly how or what, but I was curious if you could be liable in a legally binding way for a mistake this large?  I don't know the city he was in, so I'll just say NYC.   ||||| The situation isn't quite as you described.  The server admin poster wrote: > I run a small hosting provider ...Last night I accidentally ran, on all servers, a Bash script with a rm -rf {foo}/{bar}  In this case, his customers could sue his company for the loss of their business data.  Hopefully he was operating incorporated, or an LLC, and not as a sole proprietorship.  If the server admin *had been* an employee, his employer would have to show extraordinary negligence to successfully sue.  Destroying 1500 separate customers data by running a delete script, without backing up probably reaches this threshold.  ||||| Of course.  The business has a claim for whatever damages were foreseeably caused by the sysadmins negligence. ||||| I'd say it depends.  If it was a team of people who regularly run scripts in this manner, the one sysadmin may not be negligent.  If he went off and automated all this stuff in one fell swoop without a manager saying that it was fine, he done fucked up.  Practically, it is generally a horrible idea to bundle all sorts of operations (like mounting your backups and then performing any sort of deletion) all in one script.  You want to group a few commands together, run your script, check results, then make the next few commands.  Develop that stuff iteratively, test it in small batches, and run it in slightly larger batches.  I've never ran a script across my entire network all at once, lest you end up screwing up ~1500 customers worth of data.

6066	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	16	I'm 17 and still in the closet, and would just like some advice on how to come out to friends and family.  I realised there was something different when I was about 13. I used to feel attracted to women but once I started thinking about men it just felt right and I didn't feel the same for women. I thought it was just a phase and haven't actually admitted to myself that I'm gay until last year.  However I can't physically say out loud to myself "I'm gay" even though I know I am. I don't have a homophobic family or anything I'm just afraid of change and I'm scared it will change the way people will think of me. The only other gay guys I know are extremely flamboyant and feminine and I'm not in to that. I also feel guilty because when I was younger my parents found gay porn on my computer, I lied to them saying it was a virus and the memory still makes me cringe.  The main reason for wanting to come out is that I feel like I can't be myself around people and would rather just have it out there. I was thinking about coming out when I start university next year because the people would be new and I'd find it easier.  Also a different issue: I'm probably too young to be thinking like this but I feel as if I will never find someone. I'm not super unattractive or anything I just feel like no one takes any interest in me. (Also, apologies if any of this sounded ignorant) ||||| My brother was in the same situation last year when he started university. I knew already but the rest of my family didn't, like yours they suspected he might be gay* but let him come out in his own time. When he started university he didn't have to come out, when people asked he'd say he was - they didn't know any better. It made it a lot easier a few months later when he came out to the family.  * I say suspected because your parents probably suspect that you are from the gay porn and your glances in public etc.  My coming out was a lot less dramatic, mum asked I said yes and that was that.  Come out in your own time but once you're out you'll feel so much better, perhaps no one takes an interest because you're hiding a big part of yourself. Good luck and update us. ||||| 1) It will be a lot easier to come out when you are at University.  You will have a lot of new friends, have the ability to pick friends that are supportive and provide a social safety net that will make it so much easier for you to come out to your other friends and family.  2) You will find someone.  Once you are at Uni there will be so many options for you.  I assure you, you won't have a problem with that.   ||||| First of all, congratulations on coming out to yourself! That is a huge first step.  Your reason for wanting to come out--that you feel that you can't act like yourself without doing so--is a good one. If you want to wait until university when you'll have a fresh start, of sorts, and no one will know that you weren't out before, that's certainly fine. That said, you have another year of your life before that, which is a long time to wait. Ultimately, the decision of whether to wait or proceed now is yours.  Flamboyant and effeminate gay guys are more likely to be out at your age, in particular, because many of them were out from the time they could talk. They're the kinds of people who make anyone's gaydar ping. But there are plenty of other guys like you who don't fit society's stereotypes about gay people and thus have an easier time remaining in the closet. With time, you will notice more people like you in your age group coming out.  I'd encourage you to seek some support. You could join a gay-straight alliance if your school has one, or a local LGBTQ youth center. You could talk about your concerns with a school counselor or a trusted adult (e.g., a favorite teacher, or someone you know is LGBT-affirming). You don't have to go about this process alone.  I'd also encourage you to remember that coming out doesn't need to be an all-or-nothing proposition: you can come out to one or two friends, to just family, or any combination that you prefer.  Finally, two more thoughts:  1) I hope that you can forgive yourself for lying about the gay porn. You were younger, and you likely didn't know if you could feel safe in admitting that you were looking at gay porn because you're, in fact, gay. Also, this may help to break the ice with your parents: they'd have to be pretty oblivious to not have any lingering doubts about your answer. They may know that you were lying but not want to push it, or they may simply not be that surprised when and if you do come out.  2) At the age of 17, you have a long time to find someone. Many of the people who may be interested in you may not even be out yet. It's also hard for other guys to show interest in you if you're not out. I'll bet that there will be guys who are interested in you in the future, if they aren't already. ||||| How can anybody take an interest in you if you're not out yet? Sounds to me like you're right on track, coming out when you go off to college is a great time for it.  You're 17, you've got years and years ahead of you. It's way too soon to give up!  ||||| You should check out /r/gaybros.  ||||| 1. Drop bombshell 2. Seriously just do it 3. Cool! They accept it 4. If step 3 is skipped, they'll get the fuck over it 5.

I was in the same situation as you; my family was not super homophobic. And as I hoped, everything went perfectly. I suggest you give yourself some alone time and just think about it. I had known since I was 13 and it took me this long to come out, but I need to say that it is worth it. With my newfound support of my family I can now begin to come out to my friends. I assure you that you will be fine. PLEASE keep this updated and PM me if you have any questions or want to talk.   P.S. I will be posting my full coming out story tonight when I get home on /r/comingout I think you should read it for some inspiration.  ||||| Really interesting for me to see how many of us have these similar stories.  TL;DR: Took me till end 21 to accept it myself. I quicky told good friends and then family, everybody reacted really understanding (lucky me!) and I don't regret it. I have a wonderful (first) boyfriend now, and I'm very happy. The only thing I regret is not allowing myself to explore myself and hiding until I was already 21.  I actually denied myself to be gay till I was mid 20. I knew perfectly what kind of stuff I've been looking at on the internet, but whenever it crossed my mind that I could be gay I just completely blocked the train of thought. It was in my second year of university when I finally had made a lot of wonderful friends to whom I could easily talk to  about anything that came to my mind, that I explored my lacking attraction for women. I thought I might be simply asexual, because I didn't either feel a great deal of attraction  towards men in everyday situations (as opposed to on the internet, where I allowed myself those feelings, I guess). It took another year until I openly challenged whether I could find men I saw in public attractive or not, and I gradually began to understand, that I was possibly suppressing those feelings. As written above I started talking to friends about the possibility of me being gay and some freinds reacted with a "Finally, I knew it all along!" (which was a little offending, because I had uptil then always tried not to act gay, so I wouldn't be confused... I guess I was a little homophobic), whilst most friends just reacted really understanding and helped me explore this new world further. I told my family then and everything went well.  I met my first boyfriend on the internet, visited him (hundrets of kilometers away), but we're together since like 3 months now and happily so. I know it's a young relationship, and we have our ups and downs, and even if this might not work out, I'm happy to have made many experiences.  The most important thing I want to tell you with this is, that I was scared to explore myself, and to allow this inevitable "change". I had been different in various things all my life and I was leeching to be normal just once, but I eventually understood that I was only living a lie, wearing a mask and hurting myself every day.  It feels great not to do that anymore. I dont regret it :) ||||| It is scary, but once you do it, a great weight will be lifted, and you will realise, it wasn't that difficult after all. ||||| I think you'll come out in your own time, when you're ready, and lots of people won't be that surprised.  I would like to address a couple of other issues though.  I'd like you to spend about 15 minutes city on a bench in a mall or a shopping centre (depending on where you live!)  Have a cup of coffee and just watch the world go past.  What do you see?  You see attractive people, fat people, plain people, thin people, black, white, yellow, tall, short, glasses, no glasses, angry people, happy people.  All those people could be gay, because gay people are all those things.  Flamboyant is just a stereotype; sometimes it's accurate, usually it's not.  The other thing is: really?  Seventeen and worrying about not finding someone?  There's someone for everyone if you want, every type, every shape.  Don't worry about it.    Be yourself, in your own time.  Being out is simpler and more straightforward and it's considerably better than making up stories or deceiving your family and friends.
6127	1,2,3,3,2,3,3,3	30	**Season 3 Episode 2**: [Of Children and Travelers]([URL]  **Aired**: June 9, 2014  ***  An investigation into the murder of a Russian adoptee leads the team into a shady underworld; Henry faces trouble behind bars while Cady attempts to secure him competent legal representation. ||||| Does Walt even have an e-mail address. ||||| I think this episode had perfect pitch. I am a couple of years older than Robert Taylor, and when I grow up, I hope to be like Longmire.  I think the characters in Longmire are so much more fully drawn than in other shows. It's nice to be able to root for Branch even knowing what a pain in the ass he had been. And I was pleased to see the "expanded" roles given to the Ferg and to Ruby.  The only things I didn't like was that at it's shortest, Wyoming to Arizona is about a six hour drive, and I believe Absaroka County is close to Montana or about an 8 hour drive to the Arizona border. So the timing of their trip seemed off. And I didn't mind the sexual tension between Walt and Vic, although goddamn, I was so happy nothing came of it.   I also didn't understand why Cady just didn't become Henry's attorney from the very beginning, or certainly didn't become his attorney when his first public defender failed to show.  I was more than a bit worried that Walt having a vision of Henry at the school was a harbinger... I would have been terribly upset.  It was great to see Graham Greene as Malachi. Apart from having to worry about Henry, I'd like to see Malachi as a semi-recurring character.  The one false note was Vic's identification with Polina. I don't mind Vic being a bad girl, but her identification seemed sudden and the dialog forced. ||||| I really don't need the sexual tension between Walt and Vic. Those allegations came 1000% out of left field last season in whatever episode it was that she slept on his couch. Tonight was bordering on overkill. Leave it alone, writers. I don't think anyone wants to see that. ||||| Can anyone identify the music during the final scene?  It sounds like post-rock but I'm not sure if it's the show soundtrack or an established song.  ||||| Great episode.  I for one like the evolving relationship between Vic and Walt and hope they end up together at some point.  Sure seems they are heading that way! ||||| [empty] ||||| this is one of the few episodes that they left open for no reason. I don't see placing the russian girl in a home as a developing plot line though I could be wrong. 
5126	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3	16	Hi guys!  We played a lot on london, moscow, paris but one big problem is cheaters.  we thinking about abandoned server.  what can you tell me about this server? it's ok to play? ||||| London is rammed with them ||||| There are a few whitelist servers. Stronghold though so far has been the longest running and most successful. Currently we're seeing peaks of about 70ish players and it's growing everyday.   We typically get about 100 applications a day so it can sometimes take a few days for your app to be processed. But if you get approved it's totally worth it. We are selective though. But if you're a decent person, have no VAC bans, and have solid game time. You have a good shot at it.   EDIT: Regarding the Abaandoned server, it's right there at the start of the alphabetical sort. There should be lots of cheaters. Typically they're at the top and bottom of alphabetical list.  ||||| [URL]  Go there and click apply! ||||| Seems there are a few Whitelisted servers out there now. Different rule sets for each as well as population levels.   the Stronghold has been out a fairly long time and has a well adhered to rule set PhazePyre sent you the link for that.  There is also the ADK server has some rules but not restrictive. Has a few requirements such as length of time the Steam account has been active and no VAC bans within the last 6 months on any game.  Has been Low to Medium population and growing. Moderated by 4 admins at this time. The form to apply can be found here if interested. [URL]   And it looks like a new one that started today. looks like an open for all no to little requirements or application process with server admins provided by the community.

ADKxCHEF ||||| If you dont want to adhere to the strong hold rules about building and KOS The White listed server Another Kind ANK is also pretty good.      That being said I personally play on stronghold but think the option should be out there for people who want it. ||||| Can we get an application link phaze? ||||| As other people stated, the private Whitelist servers are your best bet.

3480	1,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	40	Disclaimer, this is a bit of a rant. Yesterday and today I have had people harassing me for booking vacations on holidays instead of spending time with my family or making my own family.   Background story is my mum has been a single mom my entire life, I am an only child, and we are an immigrant family so we do not really have family around as it is [My family is also largely CF]. My mum and I live a few hours apart so we typically celebrate holidays the weekend before because we both are active people that prefer to do an activity together. I am making the extra trip to visit her, we would both go insane from boredom with everything being closed on the actual holidays and sitting around her home with nothing to do.  Since we spend the holidays apart, we get to use the free time we have off of work as we want. I always travel internationally and my mum is a big DIY-er so she works on her projects. I am extremely close with my mum, but we are also mavericks and hard workers so we like having our own time.  My mum and I like our arrangement, I do not know why everyone else feels the need to criticize a system that works for us.  However, I went to high school in an area that seemed to have a higher rate of teen pregnancy than graduation and my only cousin that has kids is the definition of an entitled parent. So everyone around the holidays likes to blame me for “breaking my family apart”. I am a bad daughter for leaving my single mom alone on the holidays. It is my fault for not already having kids so I could have big family holidays. I also get told I am wasting my money by going on a few international trips every year because I should be saving for a family. [They also like telling me law school is for boys and I should not be wasting my money on it, but that is a whole different rant].  My mum always defends me and accepts that I am CF, I find it extremely amusing that everyone else that is unaffected by my choices seems to have the biggest opinion on them.  ||||| No, no, no. Don't let them make you feel like there's something wrong with you. I hate every single holiday there is because it's just a way to squeeze as much money out of people as possible. You have to buy certain things, you have to do certain activities, in a certain time. Those things are going to be overpriced as hell, there are going to be so many people doing those things at the same time that chaos is inevitable. It's crazy. When I mention this about e. g. Christmas their only (seemingly) valid excuse is: Yeah, but it's not just about presents and turkey and -insertwhatevertraditionexistsinyourculture-, it's about spending time with your family! Are you kidding me? If you really love your family, then why do you only want to spend time with them (or buy them presents) because and when everybody else does? If herd mentality is the only thing that's gonna make you want to visit your parents/siblings/etc then maybe you shouldn't bother at all. If you really want to be with your family, buy a cheaper ticket at any time of the year when planes, buses, trains aren't packed and go see them.  ||||| Tell them to btfo. It's your life, so regardless of what they think I'm sure you'll do what you want with it.  ||||| I'm glad your mom is supportive.  These other people... is there a specific need to have contact with them? Are they coworkers, friends, other family members? ||||| *My mother and I celebrate the holidays in our own special way.  We neither want nor require your opinion on how we choose to show each other affection.  Respectfully, mind your own business* ||||| Money can't buy happiness but it can buy plane tickets and that is pretty close  ||||| They're just jealous of your awesome plans. ||||| Send them a happy holiday picture from your next awesome location!   Especially in a nice and very relaxing pose and don't forget to smile , a big fucking huge and happy smile .       ||||| "Mind your own ***************g business" works for me. ||||| Tell them to go fuck themselves. As long as you and your mum are happy with the arrangements, no one else need concern themselves.  ||||| Damn, I wouldn't want to do family holidays just to avoid putting up with the cousins and what not.  My husband and I already avoid our extended and close family for similar reasons. ||||| My coworker has three kids, she recently went on holiday on her own. No-one once said it was selfish or weird, we all actually said how brave she was for going alone.  Don't worry about others, they're very close minded, rude people who aren't worth your time and *definitely* continue with law school. Your gender should never prohibit your career choices.  ||||| > My mum and I like our arrangement, I do not know why everyone else feels the need to criticize a system that works for us.  "You live a life that's different than mine! My life works for me, so your way of living must be ***WRONG***!"  Really, I think a lot of people think that if the way they're living works for them and makes them happy, then it must be the best way for *everyone* to live and be happy. They don't think of the fact that other people have different opinions and different backgrounds or anything like that, they think of what *they* consider to be a good thing, and figure that other people just need to be told about the "correct" way of living. ||||| >They also like telling me law school is for boys  Why are most bingoers also sexist or conservatively judgemental all the time? I sense a pattern.. ||||| my mom and her husband like to travel to quebec for holidays. am I going to cry about it? no, let her have fun. she deserves it. ||||| I honestly don't understand the criticism... It sounds like you've both found a way to make the whole holiday thing pleasant and doable for both of you. If you're both happy with the way you spend time together, that's all that really matters.  ||||| The "holidays are for family" people have never thought about doing their own thing, so it must be wrong.  ||||| op, just remember that we all retain the right to define our own families. ||||| > My mum and I like our arrangement  So, to paraphrase the immortal words of Eddie Murphy, "tell everyone else to have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up." If you two are happy, that's all that matters.
4082	1,3,3,3,3,3	7	I'm getting used to the disappointment at this point.  I've said "I'm done" a few times this week. It doesn't mean I'm done putting up with Nintendo - lord knows it'll take more than this to get me to boycott a company whose products I've loved for over 20 years - but I'm done getting worked up over this. It'll be out eventually, but in the meantime, I'd rather have fun than get angry.  So I'm going to finish the Gen VI section of my Living Dex, and then I'm taking a break from Pokémon. I have a huge backlog of games I've been meaning to play, and this seems like the perfect time.  Some people here are reaching for their torches and pitchforks. As for me, I'm reaching for the white flag. I give up.  Wake me up when Bank's out. ||||| Well you got the right idea, but dont give up just yet it'll come. ||||| [Zelda Four Swords if free until Fec. 2nd.]([URL] I can forgive them a little for not releasing Pokebank this week since they gave me Four Swords.

4880	1,3,3,2,3,3,3	17	Just posted this to r/asoiaf, but maybe this is a good place too:  Oh my god. RIP Ethan Forrester. That death hit me a lot harder than Eddard and Robb for some reason. Maybe its because I played as him instead of read as him. Not sure. First thing I did once I finished was check the plot summary to see if it was my fault that Ethan died (I don't think it was, I think no matter what I did, I would have been stabbed). But I am super excited for Episode 2. I think we will get to play as Asher now (he sounds like a badass). And I think Jon Snow will make an appearance next time. What did everyone else think of the game? I don't even play computer games regularly and I enjoyed that. What else do you think is to come in episode 2 for Mira, Gared, House Forrester, etc? Also, fuck Ramsay Snow.  ||||| I'm really excited for Asher too, but I think Gared is my favorite so far. I'm really interested in learning more about the North Grove, and why Duncan wants Gared to be a ranger. ||||| He shall be remembered as Ethan the Brave. Also be sure to check out Tell Tales' Walking Dead, while it's not as bloody as GoT, it's just as dark. ||||| Who did you chose as sentinel? ||||| I saw a video in which I saw Ethan got stabbed so I tried pretty hard to keep him alive. Even though I really pissed of the whitehill guy accidentally lol. I thought I was doing a good job too (keeping half of the Ironwoods) but then it happened regardless. ||||| Your decisions make no difference in the story thus far, but I'm hoping that changes later.  Ethan dying surprised me, but it seriously loses something when you realize that you die regardless of your reaction to Ramsey grabbing your sister. It makes no sense, really. Once he grabs your sister, there are 3 different reactions you can have, and each one gets you killed. "I don't need a brave/wise/bold little lord." ....  Then what do you need? If Ethan is willing to let him take his sister and do whatever the fuck he wants, why would he kill him? It just makes no sense to me ||||| I don't expect the story telling to be nearly as good as GRRM's.  All of the major deaths in his story have had a Greek tragedy feel to them with a well established character flaw that leads to their end.  Ethan's death seemed like it was just there to say that Ramsey's evil and this is GOT where anyone can die.  Kind of a pale comparison, but then GRRM is hard to live up to.  That said, I did enjoy it an I'm looking forward to future episodes.

6070	1,3,3,0	11	Getting down to it:  Through some odd turn of events I managed to land a decision in front of me: suck a random african's dick for 50 bucks in a car or don't.  I have this fear he's actually a police officer who's going to bust me for prostitution, but he offerred to suck mine too, preferred it actually.  I would rather see how good I am as it is my FIRST TIME EVER DOING THIS.  I'm scared.  Should I even do it is the main one, but everytime I say yes the taste, the feel, the smell of what a big black dick would be clouds my head.  I want to be able to do it (i do need the money haha) but right now I can't think straight (ha!) ||||| Simple don't do it. ||||| Selling out your sexuality for $50?

It's a slippery slope, bud. 
1171	1,3	4	Hi guys,   Let me start out by saying that I have absolutely zero money to offer you, in fact this will cost you (though this could end up being a paying gig if cards are played right).  My name is Erik, im 22, and I'm an Environmental Engineering student in North Carolina. Like a lot of people, I grew up in suburbs, and after spending some time in Sweden  and other countries I was struck with how novel and backwards our way of living is (car culture, fast food prevalence, driving to indoor facilities where we hamster-wheel on treadmills, the cultural and environmental costs of sprawled out urban planning, and the like). I want to represent this issue on film, through the narrative of a bike trip.   I won't get any more specific because it will have to be a collaboration, and I'm hesitant to definite things this far out more than I need to. but here is the meat:  time frame: head out from NC in early may of 2015. End on the West coast three months later ( I need to be back in school by August 20).   Pay: thats where you come in, we could kickstart this.   You: should be experienced and ambitious with your film career. If you dream of collaborating on a documentary that is very relevant to the modern condition, this is your chance. you should be in shape, and willing to buy (or already own) a bike for touring.   Us:  I need to trust you, we should probably at least get along reasonably well, and we should also agree on the ideological basis of this film on some level. The closer you are to me geographically, the better too.   Me: I have experience with film. I score documentaries and short films professionally. Examples of my work are below, one was screened in the student film category during Cannes film festival in France of this year:  [URL] [URL] [URL]  I also shot and edited this blurb for biking:   [URL]  and I make music, I'll do the music for this film:  [URL]   PM me if your serious or want to help.  -Erik  ||||| This sounds fun but the first sentence alone is every red flag filmakers try to avoid :/ 
8270	1,3,3,3	4	Hey, I'm a plat ADC main on the NA server and lately I've been getting rekt quite a bit. I've been watching my own vods, but I'm not really sure what I should be doing differently and when. I was wondering if there are any higher Elo AD's out there that would be willing to watch a VOD or 2 or coach me or anything at all that would help me improve. My name is IncredibleJJ, you can add me or message me on here if anyone would be so kind. Would really appreciate any help anyone would be willing to give! ||||| I often play Support in Plat at the moment, and one of the most common mistakes I see my ADC making (from my support-oriented PoV) are bad trades - especially against a difficult lane match-up.  If the lane match-up is not in our favour (or if the other bot lane pair are just *really* good), I'll try - at the bare minimum - to let my ADC keep up with CS, but if they're constantly trying to trade with the enemy ADC/Support, it makes it a lot harder for both of us. Once you're under 50% HP, it's much more dangerous if we get ganked or they go all-in on us.   Obviously if you're duoing and/or know a particular match-up well, this can be mitigated some-what. The rest of the time, CS safely and wait for our relevant power-spikes to kick in.   Good luck on the Rift, and Happy Monday. :) ||||| ill help u. add me on league. na server - "pomi" ||||| Hello, I am not much higher elo than you (Plat 2 currently). But here are my two cents, purely from a statistics point of view.  1. You are playing too many champions. Out of the last 10 games, you have played 7 different champions. You should choose 2 or 3 champions and use these 90% of the time. Judging from your statistics, it would probably be Caitlyn and Jhin (decent number of games with a good winrate). You can choose a 3rd champion provided you do well with him and it fills a different role from the other two.  2. Try to improve your CS at 10. Go in custom and practice farming while pushing a lot and farming while only last hitting (freeze). Caitlyn has 0.568 base AS (the second worst base AS in the game besides Graves), which is a lot slower than most of the other ADCs with 0.625. Jhin, with his 4 shots requires you to farm differently as well. Don't forget that ~15 minions is approximately as much gold as a kill.  3. In average, you have more deaths at 10 minutes than you have kills, maybe you die to ganks or get outplayed in lane. Try to be more careful. At 20 minutes it is better.  4. You don't put enough wards. It is especially important early because as long as your support doesn't have sightstone he can't have your lane warded all the time, you have to help him. Also, think about buying a pink from time to time.  5. It might be purely a matter of personal taste, but having my IE finished before finishing my Zeal item feels like a bigger powerspike to me. (BF -> pickaxe -> Zeal -> IE -> Runaan/RF/Statik)  Obviously I can't help you with how you play the games, your positioning in teamfights, etc. But hopefully fixing your basics will help you a lot.  I used rankup.gg to get these stats (I discovered it this morning, love it) : [URL]  Maybe you will find other interesting informations for you.  Good luck ;)

7761	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	9	So a little bit of background on myself. I am currently a high school senior in Vietnam (at the very end of my second semester, got a fantastic scholarship in the US). In other words, I'm 18 and I'll fancy doing a bit of growing up. Unfortunately, I hit a bit of a wall.  Recently (last 7-8 months) I've been trying my best, everyday from 6am to 2-3am with a 1-2 hour lunchtime nap, chasing what you might call the classic 'American dream'. Unfortunately, I was hospitalised last week due to exhaustion and the doctor said that I was very lucky that I didn't do any hard permanent damage to myself.   After getting released, I stopped working entirely for a week; just playing video games, catching up on movies and books. I started eating meals at the same time everyday and sleep from 10 to 5,with a nap during lunch. Surely enough, I'm getting much better physically. I feel more healthy, more energetic. However, it's absolutely killing me inside. It just feels as if for every second that I am asleep, it's a second wasted and a second further from achieving what I want. My body knows what it wants, but my brain is yearning for that dream even if that means death it seems.   Yet, I'm starting to notice how much time I've missed out with my friends, how far behind I am in Games etc. and in a way I also want to participate in those 'fun' activities as well. My mental state these past week has been completely unstable, half of me wants to continue working but half of me wants to just enjoy myself in the moment. I know what I want, but I don't know which one to pick.   I apologise if this is so vague but the amount of confusion I'm going through right now in monumental.  ||||| Always enjoy life. One of the top things old people regret on their deathbed, is not having enjoyed life as much as they could, because they worked too much. Now go. Go out there and fucking enjoy life! ||||| The two being the same is your ultimate goal. There's a sense of satisfaction in hard work, otherwise you wouldn't do it. Sometimes we work hard because it is the easiest thing to do. In your case, don't put so much weight on yourself. Don't chase the American dream, chase your own. Don't fear poverty or weakness, but understand your motivations for seeking it's alternative. If you can't appreciate life while you work hard, when will you decide to change? Don't habitually sacrifice the moment for the future, you'll end up going through life without living.  Best wishes ||||| Sounds to me like you need a vacation. ||||| Neither, both. ||||| Everything in moderation ||||| You need to work hard, and enjoy. It doesn't need to be this or that. Find something that you like to do. Enjoy learning ! Use your intelligence to figure out what to learn to get the maximum return.  And also learn how to BALANCE. There will be times when you don't necessarily like what you have to do  - but BALANCE helps in those times. ||||| 2 weeks hard work, a few days off.  Rinse, repeat.

6205	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	9	Im so frustated with the fact that I have to spend so much money to keep playing this game, its ability rendered with the fact that just by spending on an amazing super expensive card you can win a match? Ive just started five months ago, and I love the game, the cards, the strategy, the art, everything, but I keep getting frustated in novice tournaments just because my deck costs 80 dollars in total and there are guys who start with 300-400 dollar decks, I dont have that much money to spend and I live in a country where its much more expensive to buy things valued in dollars, I love the game but if I cant start to spend more money I will.not be able to play and enjoy this game, sorry for the rant and the bad english I guess ill look for a more cheap hobby ||||| You can expect almost any hobby to be expensive. Magic is only pay to be competitive. You can easily enjoy the game casually. I've spent around $70 for a deck, and its been useable for the last 5 years, even more playable with EDH's popularity. ||||| Don't be frustrated. If your budget isn't that high, you might want to look into playing other formats, like draft or sealed. In these formats, everyone starts equal, because you can only use the cards from those packs. ||||| Do you have friends you play with, or literally any option other then tournaments with real stakes?  Because I find "let's play with piles of our terrible cards" to be one of the better formats ||||| This just in: Things cost money. News at 11  If you want a free hobby take up checkers.  ||||| Try some Casual, or find a playgroup that does challenge decks or the like. Make a ridiculous deck for no reason other than you can - like a Crabs with Guns. Maybe find other potential outlets. Fiction, art, altering, collecting, design, there is so much more to this game than just competitive play that really price can only keep you out if your goal is to play professionally. ||||| Play Limited (Sealed or Draft). In my opinion Limited formats much more fun and skill intensive compared to constructed. ||||| There's a player at my LGS that spends max $80 on his decks every standard rotation. He's one of the better players and consistently top 8s FNMs. He usually sticks to one or two colours (saving on lands).   How does he do this, you ask? He's extremely good at valuing cards when they come out. He's playing rabble red this standard season, but he picked up his playset of Rabblemasters on release day for $1 each because he knew it's a solid card. It's possible to play on a budget in magic, you just need to do your research and operate within your constraints.  ||||| Something you may not have considered is that even if you had this expensive deck, you may still lose. This game is very skill intensive, and luck is a huge factor. Play draft if the oat of singles is getting you down
8665	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	40	[empty] ||||| Even though I'd hate to see it happen, I'd be least surprised if the next character to go was Carol.  Even though I'd love to see it happen, I'd be most surprised if the next character to go was the governor.  ||||| I don't know why but I have a funny feeling that Glenn is going to die soon. ||||| A lot of people are saying Beth which I really hope isn't true since she seems to be the one who keeps the groups spirits up. ||||| I'm thinking Glenn.  The Greene's haven't had a loss since Patricia in S2 finale.  Maggie is too popular and too strong a character to realistically die unless she gets shot or something.  Glenn still has that awkwardness and young ruthlessness that could put him in hot water.  Hershel is Rick's other right hand man so I don't think he'll go.  And Beth is a main character now, I'm sure I remember the writers saying they had more in store for her and Carol.    So I think a Glenn death shortly before or after his wedding would be likely.  Probably before since the general theme of the deaths on the show is "We just ran out of time". ||||| I honestly don't think that it's gonna be Carol. We've already "felt" having lost her at one point, and she's had enough character building. I think she'll last at least one more season.   I don't think it's gonna be Hershel (I think I spelled that right, apologies if I didn't) [because](/g "he already lost his leg. What I've noticed in this series is that after someone suffers like that, they generally last for a while. If they killed him, it'd be wasted character building.")  They've already put us through the basic tragedy of losing a loved one too many times, so I don't think that they will kill off only ONE of Glenn or Maggie. If they kill either of them off, I bet it'd be both of them die together, or the other does some sort of suicide type deal (like going in on an all out attack on the governor). If one dies, I bet both die.  They're not gonna kill of Daryl. They'd lose too large of an audience (not including me, I for one consider him overhype, even though I like him).  I don't think it's gonna be Beth. We haven't seen enough character building, but the little that we have seen would be wasted (Carl's crush).   Governor isn't gonna be next, that would be stupid. As much as I want him to die,  he was last seasons main protagonist. If he dies, he's gonna be a season-finale type deal.   Carl isn't gonna die. Again, we've got way too much character building to see. It would all be wasted.  Rick - haha funny. No but seriously, that would be an insane twist to kill of the main character. As sad as I'd be, that would definitely keep me hooked, but it's not gonna happen.  The Baby isn't gonna die either. That's basically the future of the show.   I don't think Tyreese will die soon at all. I have a feeling he's about to become a huge character, seeing as he is on the posters for season 4.   Michonne could die soon, but I think that she has a little bit of time left. She really just got into the group, and from what I hear she is a pretty huge part in the comic (even though they are unrelated).  I think I covered the entire group, if not close. Oh, I did forget about all of the citizens of Woodbury. Ya, they're dead. I'm pretty sure the writers are gonna be too lazy (and who can blame them) to write backstories for all of these new characters. When my dad and I watched this we agreed that they were really just put in there because they were running out of people to kill off. Maybe they'll give us backstories on two or three of them, but I wouldn't say there are any others.  TLDR: Because of character building, the best shot of people dying are gonna be the citizens of Woodbury, or if just looking at main characters, Glenn AND Maggie together.  Edit: Typo  Edit2: Forgot Michonne and Tyreese  Edit3: typo ||||| I feel like Judith may be the next to go. Comics I think Michonne  ||||| As much as I hate it I think Hershel will be next among several of the woodbury survivors.   They have to leave the prison eventually and will need to thin out the cast.  Hershel wont travel well with 1 leg. ||||| I think Tyresse's sister (I forgot her name) because that will have huge effects on Tyresse and add depth to his character.  A lot of people are saying Glenn, but I highly doubt it. With the whole proposal thing and the fact that there are no other couples around, I think it's an awful time to get rid of him. ||||| most likely carol is going to die next ||||| I think it might be Hershell. The guy only has one and a half leg, he's not going to be running from zombies very fast. I think if the writers kill of Daryl a lot of people would be pretty upset. I read somewhere that the writers were even getting letter threats not to kill him off lol.   But yea, I think Hershell will be next to go. ||||| Just wait and see who is going to start being a good person. Seriously, without getting too spoilery, every time a character starts to become a morally correct person (i.e. refusing to murder someone,not wanting the living to fight each other, not stealing your sweatroll even though they're hungry, etc.) they die a few episodes later. It's like the writers are saying "be an asshole in an apocalypse, or you will die." ||||| I don't read the comics, so I have no idea what comes up in the future. As solely a watcher of the show, I would predict Carol. ||||| I would say nobody does. It will most likely be some other main character who will be introduced next season and they die late in the season

6757	1,3,3	7	I have a mostly transparent image and I'd like to sample vertex coordinates and randomly adjust the alpha values of specific vertices to achieve a twinkling effect. Whether or not a vertex has its alpha adjusted should depend on whether or not it contains color.  I'm working with a mostly transparent image which I've randomly colored selective pixels in to represent stars. Whenever I encounter a vertex that contains color information I'd like there to be a random chance that its alpha is adjusted.  Is this possible? How expensive would it be? The rendering engine I'm using doesn't currently support point sprites, so rather than rendering a whole bunch of individual sprites I opted for a single large image.  If it's not - I may have to try to use individual sprite images per star.  Thanks! ||||| Which OpenGL version? Surely you could write something like this in the fragment shader:      if (texture(skyTexture, uvPos).r > 0) {         outColor.a = pseudoRandom(uvPos + vec2(uniformSeed));      },  where pseudoRandom() would be a random generator you can find on Google and you would have to send a random seed each frame. It could be, however, that the twinkling would be way too fast this way. ||||| An alternative can be using a texture of noise.

8066	1,3,3,3	22	Lets say I have LIFE TIME INSURANCE, Someone boards my ship, and perma kills me, What happens?  Do I respawn with a new ship w/LTI -? ||||| Yep. But depending on the ship you might not get it right away(they take time to build). ||||| From what I remember reading waaaaaay back, death is very interesting.     You don't 'die' on the first few go arounds.  You'll respawn with 'battle-damage'.  You'll lose an arm.  Maybe an eye.  You'll keep spawning with implants until you can no longer support it.  Once that happens, you'll perma die and respawn as another member of your family (taking a reputation hit).

5369	1,3,3	4	I swear I've looked into this for a long time, but there are so many receivers out there that I'm overwhelmed! Thanks so much for any help!  Anyway, I'd like to upgrade my current non-HDMI receiver (I have all my HDMI going through the TV with optical to the receiver) to something where I can just plug all my sources into the receiver and then take a single HDMI cable up to the TV. What's even more important to me, though, is "midnight mode", as they call it. I live in a small apartment with small kids and like to watch movies late at night with the spouse. I also appreciate a receiver without too much depth so that it will actually fit into most cabinets (we need a new one of those too).  I'm currently settling on the Yamaha RX-V375, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something. How is Yamaha's Adaptive DRC? Is Audyssey king here? Is it worth paying for?  Thanks again for any help!  EDIT: Oh, the other option is the Marantz NR1403 for Audyssey compression. But it's more expensive and has 2 more inches of depth.  EDIT2: Okay, thanks for the help guys! I went with a third option, actually, the Denon AVR-S500BT. Just $250 bucks, but with Audyssey, 5 HDMI inputs, and two of them are HDMI 2.0. Normally I don't care about forward compatibility, but 4K actually intrigues me. ||||| The Yamaha is a great choice. Audyssey is good, but not worth the extra money in your scenario ||||| Depends, if room calibration is not as important go for the Yamaha. They are well made. If room calibration is important than go with Denon or Marantz. I know you are looking at the 1403 but there are less expensive Denon options as well.
3291	1,3,3,3	10	Hey Guys, I wanted to ask about a PC that i want to build in April, but i wasn't sure that if i pick a cheaper CPU, it will bottleneck the GPU or not. Here is the [list of parts]([URL] (approximate/roughly), please let me know if there is a cheaper CPU i could use, or any other improvements :) ||||| To be honest you could get away with an AMD Athlon 860K as the absolute cheapest option. In reality that CPU wouldn't bottleneck a 960 at all, but keep in mind that some games can be quite CPU intensive rather than GPU intensive, and for those titles the 860K might struggle a bit.   If you can afford to, I would be looking more towards an i3 4130, or even an i5 4460 if you can.   EDIT: You forgot to post the part list - if you give us the parts you've chosen and your budget we can suggest improvements for you.  ||||| I'm going to assume your budget is £500? In which case, I see you've already opted for an i5 4460, which is a great choice for a £500 budget. There are a couple of changes I would make though.  - You've opted for a H81 chipset motherboard. The case you've chosen has USB3 ports on the front but H81 motherboards do not have a USB3 header. For this reason I suggest you get a B85 motherboard instead, so that you can use these USB3 ports. - You can get a 4GB R9 380 for the same price as a 2GB GTX 960, and the 380 is a much more powerful GPU. I would suggest making this change unless you have a specific reason for getting a 960.

2084	1,3,3,3	4	It was extremely interesting, and inspiring. I've defended Dave here, in Los Angeles comedy clubs to other comedians (non-celebrity ones like me, that is), and to friends. After all, if a white person went to Europe to take a break from Hollywood, they aren't called 'crazy' or accused of 'smoking crack cocaine', like Newsweek did to Dave.   One of the key bits of the discussion between Lipton and Dave was that of racism in America. Right now, a big debate is erupting in Florida over a vigilante killing- a modern day lynching- that was racially motivated. Having just seen the Chappelle interview this week- fascinated by it, and inspired by it- I felt the need to apply his dialogue to what's happening in Floria with the Trayvor Martin killing.   It's tough to introduce this topic on reddit, which is predominantly white. But comedy is so important because it is, as Bill Maher and Carlin said, the 'last place where you can tell the truth." Comedians are more than song-and-dance men, they bring real issues to life and hold up a mirror to society.    ||||| my take on watching Chappelle interview, then seeing the controversy play out in Florida.   [URL] ||||| if a white person went to Europe to take a break from Hollywood, they aren't called 'crazy' or accused of 'smoking crack cocaine'   hahaha that's so true. it was a very racist-y thing of Newsweek to suggest. ||||| in the past 24 hours since I posted this and a couple of other front-page posts in r/politics...  I've been amazed by the unpaid 'defense attorneys' trolling threads...claiming that Trayvon was "looking for a house to rob", was threatening because of his "athletic" build, and more likely to commit crimes because he is black.  here's one gem with more than 5 dozen upvotes:  [URL]  like zombies, every troll in /r/politics has staggered towards my posts or submissions, including a self-post, about trayvon martin because they were on the front page of r/politics.  by trying to spread honest information from news sources, I became a target for a few dozen racists, apologists, concern trolls, trolls, rednecks, sockpuppet accounts, and liars. I've probably had upwards of 200 comments, replies, and messages about how 'racist' or evil I am for discussing the racial motives behind Martin's murder.  it's almost as if no one got murdered. It's as if a circlejerk by conservatives out to protect Zimmerman- why?- is MORE important than Trayvon's murder. I guess if a girl gets killed in an alley by a suspected rapist, there will be idiots claiming the girl picked a fight with the suspected rapist, who was acting in 'self defense'.  Every punk with an internet connection feels like they can just get online and disrespect Trayvon Martin's case. Yeah, I know this website is overwhelmingly white. And in the past two years it's become so popular it attracts the troll walkers of the internet, zombies who'll go anywhere and comment so that they can get attention.  nobody blamed conservatives or right wingers for what happened to Trayvon. we blamed Zimmerman and an inept police department that botched the response.  But these hordes of trolls, alternating between faux-formality and childish jeers, have been trying to "stay on message" with conservative talking points.  the lead talking point starting online at Stormfront, and emanating into rightwing discussion boards afterwards, is that the shooting was a 'good shot' and Zimmerman is "hispanic, not white".  15 essential facts to know about this case: [URL]  fuck the trolls, I'm not afraid to speak out against murderous psychopaths.

If everyone was allowed to spend the same amount of money (perhaps the average amount of earnings across the whole league, which would still benefit clubs near the top but would penalise clubs at the bottom less IMHO) as opposed to be allowed to spend their income, it would allow smaller clubs to rise to the top far more easily. This favours the likes of us, Chelsea, Arsenal and Man U to spend big whilst the likes of QPR and Southampton have to spend small as they are small earning clubs and will be stuck like that for years to come now.  Opposition to these rules came from City, of course we want to spend our owners money! Although as we are already constrained by the European FFP rules it is a moot point for us really. We simply cannot afford to spend too much in case we break the rules and are suspended from the Champions league.  Also and quite interestingly, clubs like Aston Villa, Fulham and West Brom were supposedly against this as they were hoping for a rich benefactor and think their chances of getting a rich owner will be lessened if said owner cannot pump money into the clubs.

I want to prepare for the worst, so if there is any software, hardware (discrete GPS receiver?), or container-type things I can get to prevent my computer from being stolen or recovering it if it is, I would love to hear your recommendations. ||||| Prey is the best software anti theft solution I've found, but it has a bit of a flaw.  Someone steals your SP3.  You use a different computer to tell Prey your SP3 is stolen, but your SP3 doesn't hear from Prey's servers until someone uses WiFi to connect your SP3 to the internet.  And presumably, they won't know your password to log in to connect.   I'm not aware of a situation where an SP3 connects to WiFi on its own.  So I enabled the guest account and locked its permissions pretty tight in the off chance that the thief would log in with it and connect to the internet.  Sounds dumb, but I can't think of a better solution.  Anyone have any ideas?  And of course keep it locked up or physically with you.    HA...  You could get some larger, geeky, cheap looking 'tourist guide book' and hollow put the middle and keep your sp3 in it.  Sort of camouflage the sp3 with junk.

Or, since you don't want to look like too much like an American swine, you could buy a messenger bag.

8792	1,3,3,3,3,3	16	After playing with the patch for some time now i have discovered two things. The campaign AI Has gone from Bad to Great. Honestly Good job to CA getting it fixed. Now... This is still a problem in my eyes [URL] But let me know if Im being stupid or you Agree with me. ||||| I'm happy that they are fixing one thing at a time. If the battle AI improvement will be just as big in the next patch, pretty much everything in the game is good. ||||| Yes the only time I've ever lost a battle is when I was outnumbered by a few thousand troops and the AI just rushed me. And in fact, the only reason I lost is because my units were so sluggish/buggy in those massive battles that half the time they wouldn't attack or move and just stood there getting slaughtered. ||||| Battle AI was better for me *before* the patch. I just got caught in a siege that was unwinnable because they couldn't attack the gates which were glitched open, so the AI gave up, sent some skirmishers to do as much damage as possible, then just stood there.  Not actually the AI's fault in retrospect, since they tried to burn the gate before but it was glitched open. After losing 3/4 of that unit, they pulled it back and refrained from further attempts, seeing the crazy amount of casualties that unit sustained. ||||| Not really the AI that's bothering me but the flag capture points which piss me off. My city was being attacked by an army 3x the size of mine. I put a tight phalanx position at a narrow choke at my city. My pike men held off the infantry and cavalry at the front, while my archers rained in on damage. All the remaining infantry who weren't in the front, were either supporting the front, or they were placed in position to intercept enemy flanking maneuvers. In the beginning, the AI bum rushed but my 2 lines of reserve were able to hold them off. Eventually, my superior strategy and unit placement held off the attackers and I slaughtered more than half the enemy army while sustaining minimal casualties, but I ended up losing the battle and my city. Why? Cause during the fray, I didn't notice that half of an enemy unit made it to the capture point and won the AI the game. Idk if this was stupidity on my part in that I ignored something that was so obvious in the gameplay or if this is something legitimately wrong with Rome ii. ||||| Units *do* route for other reasons than their number versus that of the enemy.  And, a larger force, having routed, wouldn't just regroup because it outnumbered its pursuers 5:1 or more.
3838	1,3,3	4	Hello guys, how are you doin' today? Well I was playing on a Brazilian Hardcore Server, and after walking and scavenging a while without finding any item. I got hit by invisible zombie, and I have sure that was zombies cause I saw no player around or heard any gunshots. Well I'm not here to complain but here to ask if any of you guys actually got this issue on this stable version. Thx for reading... ||||| That happened to me too. And I died because of it. ||||| Yep. Happened to me today. In Berezino by the docks. At first I thought that it's some hacker and started to run away from it. Another hit, another run. After few more hits (which caused bleeding ofc.) he showed himself :) And to be honest this was one of those "almost shit myself" moments.
4334	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	15	I mean, wasn't there some bible story about Solomon building a palace that was more extravagant than the temple?  If I were still a TBM, I think that would make a heavy first item to be thrown onto my shelf.    ||||| It's a fair criticism.  More than that, though, it wouldn't be such a huge deal if it were a vehicle to help alleviate those that are really in need.  It would seem bloody brilliant of the Mormon deity if the for profit arms of his divine church were meant to funnel money towards stuff that really benefits his children.  Instead, that money sits there.  Billions of it. ||||| A luxury mall that kicks out people for really crazy reasons like modesty or holding hands with your gay bf.  The church also builds luxury apartments.  Show Jesus the $$$$$......  It is now building a city close to Disney World.  No joke. ||||| My still unanswered question is how much money from the "for profit" arms of the TSCC is funneled back into the church or humanitarian aid. Given that GBH was a two faced liar and not a single rank and file member knows anything about church finances, I'd be willing to bet it is a number close to zero.  ||||| There are so many biblical parallels between the bad guys and LDS Inc.  I remember my dad mumbling to himself when I was a teen trying to reconcile how church funds were being spent, that the Profits knew best, etc.  I think the Profits can just leave it up to the members to come up with reasons why their financial decisions are justifiable and even good for "the kingdom".  No one holds them accountable. ||||| The church spends practically everything on humanitarian aid.  They're just too humble to say how much it is. ||||| Guys, seriously. With all the comments on here the average member just doesn't know this stuff. They think they spend millions on humanitarian aid and the mall was done with other people's investment money.  The average member just doesn't know what you know.  ||||| Oh no.  They justify it by spreading the (little) amount of money (compared to what they could do) to charity.  Or they say "It's a business investment to do more good in the future!"  Mental Gymnastics, my friend. ||||| Washington DC temple cost 17 m to build ( late 70's ).   Take all the temples in the world. It will never add up to, 2 Billion $$$$  ||||| >Show Jesus the $$$$.   That literally made me lol ||||| >Shouldn't TBM's be concerned that the church spends vastly more money on a shopping mall than it does a temple?  Shouldn't TBM's be concerned that the church built a mall in the first place?  Maybe ask where they got the money to build a 1.5 billion dollar mall? ||||| They are inspired by The Lord, so it is all OK. No tithing money is used, so it is all OK. Why would you worry about it, have you read your scriptures in the Book of Mormon today? ||||| Honestly, I've always hated the idea of expensive temples.  A big part of jesus' teachings were about not worrying about money, status, or appearance; they were about loving God and being excellent to eachother.      Building a golden house that only the chosen few are allowed into does not at all fit with what Jesus taught, so spending more on worldly things is far more appropriate.      God doesn't care what building prayers comes from.
6782	1,3,3,3,3	15	I've been living in Huntington for 6 months now, and just can't seem to find any sort of music scene. I'm sure it's there, I think I'm just looking in the wrong place! I'm not looking for concerts, just local bands who play at smaller bars. Anyone have any suggestions? ||||| Gypsy Den in Santa Ana and Costa Mesa tend to have small acts. Sometimes bands play at the district. I'm really not sure what else to say.  It's not really a movie out here where you can walk into a random coffee shop and have that cute singer/song writer belting out something wonderful. If you're looking for local acts, you might take a chance at Chain Reaction (Anaheim if I remember correctly). I've also heard tell of music and the Detroit Bar in Costa Mesa, but not sure how often those are local/small acts. ||||| There's a website that lists open mica around the area.  (god I wish I could think of it of the top of my head, will repost it when I get home)  Gypsy Den has music nights and open mic but the l open mic is super short. Like 1-2 songs max. And get there early it fills up fast.   Night Owl in downtown Fullerton has... Well late night open mics on tuesdays and any money the artist makes is supposedly matched by the cafe and donated to local charities.   Chain Reaction is great for exposure, especially with 14-30's. But if you want to play there be ready to peddle tickets. Pay to play. But worth it.   Once in a wild blue moon House of Blues Anaheim has local nights. But p2play as well.   That's all I can think of for now. I just got back in the area and had zilch luck looking for bandmates and places to play. I feel your pain there.  ||||| SoCal has a raging punk scene.   All kinds of music. Don't know what you're into so.. ||||| Dunno if you're into EDM but that scene is exploding all over california, especially socal.
495	1,3,3,3,3	5	[empty] ||||| I had a girlfriend whom I thought I was in love with. After about a year she broke up with me via a text message because apparently I was not showing her enough attention. Turned out she cheated on me actually.  ||||| Was trying to give a sedative to an increasingly agitated patient via shot in the leg. Several security guards were restraining him. Immediately after inserting the needle, the patient was overcome with amazing strength. Threw off the security guards, pushed me down, grabbed the syringe and needle, and stabbed the doctor in the chest with it while yelling, "I HATE NEEDLES!" ||||| When I was taking an esclator that esclated faster than other esclators. ||||| When everybody in the world realized that Burgundy actually said, "BOY, that escalated quickly."
574	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0	16	Just curious how many people have had enough and will bail on these leagues when they finally get back to action. I'm not a huge NBA fan so it wouldn't be that difficult for me to totally cut it out of my life, the NFL on the other hand... ||||| Zero. ||||| it happled to the MLB.  ||||| I'm willing to say it now. ||||| I don't care for either, nor did I care for them before these strikes. ||||| Honestly, I don't really watch baseball or hockey anymore because of their shenanigans. ||||| Right as long as they don't start cancelling games I will watch. I love football.  Go Browns!!!  ||||| these lockout won't result in missed games though...so none.  MLB lost a season, hockey too...you lose games people turn their back for a while. ||||| I was a huge baseball fan throughout my childhood.  My dad took us to Sox games *all the time.*  We probably went a dozen times a summer.  One year, the Sox owned.  They had Ozzy Guillen, Frank Thomas, Robin Ventura, Ron Karkovice... and then MLB went on strike.  As a kid, I was crushed.  Our team was finally going to win!  I stopped watching MLB after that (although I did watch the World Series in 2005 when the White Sox won it).   ||||| It took baseball several years and the home run race between McGwire and Sosa to even begin getting people back. It's really going to depend how long it drags out, though. The baseball strike was damaging because the World Series got cancelled. Missing some of the regular season probably won't hurt them too much, but if it lasts long enough to take out the Super Bowl/NBA Playoffs, you could see some serious damage.  ||||| One of the largest tragedies in this country is how sports goons make tons more money than scientists and inventors. ||||| I've already bailed on the NBA, and I think the NFL owners deserve to get fucked but I hope football resumes at some point. As long as baseball is still being played I could care less. ||||| Fuck sports. Such a waste of time.

1644	1,3,3,3	12	Hello reddit, I'm planning on upgrading my GPU and my monitor in the near future. As of now I have an I7-4770K and a GTX 760 in my computer but I plan on getting a 1080 ASAP ^^  Along that, I want to upgrade my 1080p Monitor aswell and as I did some research one question bothered me: Why not just go 4K (UHD) instead of 1440p while monitors have nearly no price difference?  Another question is: What if my GPU can't handle 4K yet? Will I be able to properly "downscale" a 4K Monitor to 1080p if necessary?  Two monitors I'm interested in are: 1. Samsung U28E590D (390€) (UHD) 28" 2. Acer G277HUsmidp (340€) (WQHD) 27"  Please let me know if I'm doing something horribly wrong, it's my first reddit-post attempt :)  Edit: I f****d up the Flair for sure xD ||||| Go 4k, I had the same dilemma and after buying a 4k monitor I feel stupid for considering 1440p. Not sure why people seem to have an issue with windows scaling because it works just fine for me, the only glitchiness is some applications like adobe reader don't seem to get the memo that it doesn't  need to be scaled anymore once moved to the 1080p monitor I have next to the 4k one. Otherwise games downscale just fine to 1440p/1080p and general content like videos and pictures look great. A lot of my textbooks I just get as pdfs and I have to say there's just something nice about reading now, the text is so smooth and crisp it's almost enjoyable ||||| I say 1440p because with 4K unless you get a 35+ inch monitor you NEED scaling, and Windows scaling is trash.  Just for the love of god get a good quality IPS monitor, and don't torture yourself with TN ||||| 4K is the new standard, I don't see why anyone would downgrade to QHD and yes, your card can do 4K @ 60Hz via Displayport 1.2.

4183	1,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	23	I bought a 10ml bottle of vanilla custard from Gremlin a couple weeks ago and I am thoroughly addicted to it. I'm planning on ordering bigger bottle soon and I figured I might try try something new while I'm at it.  I did buy a couple others with my purchase so custard isnt technically my only buy. I got red, white and blue (strawberry, blueberry, vanilla) which is also quite tasty, strawberry kiwi which is ok but not my cup of tea (too sweet), and a sample of brown gremlin which is very well done but I dont think I'd want a whole bottle.  Any suggestions of the "best of the rest"? No tank crackers please, I'm using evods. ||||| Not sure if it cracks tanks and says untested on the site, but pink sunburst is boobies. Also, gummy troll  ||||| Blue Gremlin is *awesome*, and Chocolate Overload is really good too! ||||| my other favorites are the original apple pie and root beer,,, but i think they're both tank crackers ||||| What type of flavors do you like?

Pink sunburst is fantastic, Grem melon balls and Cinn-ful pear are also very good.  ||||| I ended up getting vanilla custard, peaches and cream, orange gremlin, brown gremlin, and honey and pear. I have not tried the honey pear yet...  not enough tanks haha.  All the rest are really good honestly.  peaches and cream needed a 1 day hot steep to really bring out the peach taste because initally it was overpowered by the cream, but now its amazing... and the best part is... it isn't a tank cracker! ||||| Grem Melon (my adv). cinn-ful pear, chocolate overload, bret's breakfast blend ||||| Melon balls.

It would make more sense if there was a hardcore mode like New Vegas. ||||| I want a mod to let me plant it as the domestic version at 2x cost ||||| I guess if you have the perk, you can eat it without fear of radiation.

3019	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	I was wondering who has the biggest selection of craft beer to buy at a store. All I really know of is Big Red Liquors, but there are several locations and they don't seem to be consistent with their selection. I know there are many bars with craft beer, but I don't always want to go out.  Thanks! ||||| i have always found a good selection at Sahara Mart. Both locations have a big selection... but some beers may be really old.. ||||| I select most of the craft beer for one of the smaller Big Red stores, so I can give some insight.  Each store has a lot of individual control over what they carry, and stores cater to their local clientele.  The big store (8th and College) will have the widest selection, but may not have specific beer you're looking for.  Some stores are more craft beer-centric because they have employees who are knowledgeable beer enthusiasts.  This is what I look for in a beer place.  I like to talk to people about the selection, get recommendations, etc.  There's a sprinkling of home brewers in the chain, too.  Try College Mall (in front of Kroger), West 3rd (next to the Jiffy Lube), and 2nd & Walnut (near Saraha Mart).  I can vouch for these stores in particular.  In my own personal beer shopping experience, Saraha Mart's beer sits around for a *long* time.  They're usually cheaper than Big Red, but I only buy it if I can see a date code.  Imperials stouts and barleywines would be fine, but I probably wouldn't buy an IPA from them. ||||| Sahara Mart on 3rd and the Big Red across from Smallwood probably have the biggest selections in town.  I'd say look at Sahara Mart if you're looking for more foreign beers, or Big Red if you're looking for the largest selection of already-cold beer.  You can also buy carry-out from The Tap, but you'll pay more there, especially for most of the non-Indiana stuff. ||||| Sahara mart has a decent selection, but be very weary - some of that beer has sat on those shelves for a long time and is quite old. For instance, never buy a wheat-style beer from Sahara Mart, but if you're going for a big mean imperial something then you're probably fine.   Big Red on College and 8th has a decent selection. While its not amazing by any means, its probably the best you'll find in town. Also, they have craft beer mailing list that you can get on that's great to find what they are bringing in and other discounts - I think just ask at the counter.  ||||| You can also by growlers of Bloomington Brewing Company beer at Lennie's.  ||||| Sahara mart , either location. But the one on east 3rd has more, and seemingly better prices. rogue hazelnut brown nectar ftw! ||||| Has anyone mentioned Upland? They have a few really good beers you can get at most liquor stores and they do offer growlers, though I don't know that the price is all that great. Sometimes in the fall they offer a stout called Teddy Bear Kisses which fairly well blew my mind.

Mum - the rapt, blissful nostalgia in her eyes as she watched old black and white films on the VCR that she had only seen before in the cinema in her teens and twenties, and had never expected to see again at all. ||||| I was staying with my grandparents who were taking care of my great grandmother whom we called Mema.  Well Mema had Alzheimer's but she was still as sweet as could be. One morning when I came out for breakfast, I was wearing a Roswell New Mexico tanktop with an alien on it.  When I sat down she said, "Is that you on your shirt?"   Me and my grandparents laughed so hard and they told her it was an alien and she laughed too.  A few years later we came over to their house for Christmas and my grandparents gave us a Keurig and a multi box of K cups. Well Mema had stolen a hot chocolate cup and she was sneaking hits of the chocolate. It was so funny when we caught her. We all just laughed and laughed.

I suggest antimicro, a quick google search finds it and it's pretty self explanatory once you plug your controller into it. ||||| First you need a driver that will make your PS3 controller compatible with PC.   1.

3109	1,3,3,3,3,2,3	10	[deleted] ||||| pretty sure BF works the same as PAD, the data is sent to your phone as soon as you enter, with determined drops, so you see what's dropped, then when you finish, the client sends a verification back to the server to verify the drops. ||||| Your game client could also report results to the server after the battle has ended... I don't know how this kind of thing hasn't been data mined yet. This isn't really evidence either way.  ||||| The other thing to consider is, sometimes while playing, the game crashes and then resumes mid-dungeon.. if there weren't some "checkpoint" in the game mid-dungeon, how could you resume mid-dungeon? ||||| Hmmm, well what about this as a potential theory.  When you start a quest/vortex dungeon, the server sends your phone/mobile device the info that has all the possible outcomes/chances/rng stuff so that you don't need to be connected. So the overkill theory is still plausible because that information is already on your phone. Ex: When you open a dungeon some random monster has a code like "If overkill is > #, then %chance drop+". Not a hard code to put in tbh, especially if it's only temporary. ||||| Stop trying to break the 4th wall! Lol, but seriously this is very interesting. However, you mentioned you captured Xenon at school. Did you stop playing afterwards or did you finish the entire mission?  ||||| That is an interesting theory but I just don't think the proof you provided is enough. I can't help but to relate the unit drop mechanic with the item drops. Certainly, both have a sort of randomness to it whether it being pseudo-randomness or not. Item drop rate however, can be affected by many variables such as the Thief Bracer and later on the newly released "Zel Knight" unit. If the unit drops are predetermined, I would assume item drops would be too, otherwise it would not make sense. The problem is that with items, there are circumstances that can be met to change the drop rate which leads me to doubt your theory. Not to say that I am against it, I just don't see any substantial evidence proving it to be true.

8832	1,3,3	6	Is it possible to do it on a day trip on public transportation.... taking the first train (or bus) there and the last one back?  Is it necessary to stay the night?  Also, what are the best tours to take?  I was there several years ago, but I found the tours to be more disorganized than I anticipated.  I arrived early in the morning, but I didn't find tours I could join easily.  My parents are mid 60s and have a few health issues.  I'm trying to plan a great trip to Italy for them.  They are booking several nights in Rome, but they're worried about moving to too many cities (they're already also traveling to Florence and Venice).  Also, they're on a somewhat limited budget - so they'd love to see Pompeii in the most budget friendly way possible.  They're hoping to do a day trip - but, I'm not sure that it's reasonable or possible.  Seeing Pompeii is a priority.  I'd welcome any advice about how to get the most out of a trip there.  Thanks. ||||| Super easy. Just head to the Roma Termini station and take the Frecciarossa train to Napoli Centrale. From there, head downstairs and board the Circumvesuviana and get off at Pompeii. There is a luggage hold downstairs at the Circumvesuviana station if you need it.  Its a good idea to prebook the Frecciarossa high speed train. Look for a "mini" fare on Trenitalia.com. There is an English link at the top. Mini fares are limited and very discounted. The circumvesuviana is basically a suburban train. No need to pre-book. Pretty cheap. We hired a tour guide. It was totally worth it. There is a tour guide place right when you get off the train. ||||| to go from rome to naples you can catch a fast train takes about 2-3 hours (i forget exactly) then from naples you swap over to the local trains and it's about another 40min - 1 hr on the slow train out to pompeii. to do this trip twice in the same day would be hell for me, instead i would suggest an overnight in naples and let them enjoy more of pompeii while relaxed

Any tips or recommendations are appreciated. ||||| I got my PSE Stinger 3g for $500 out the door from my local proshop with everything needed but the skill to start hunting.  ||||| Be sure you get one that has adjustable draw lengths and the poundage is adjustable they have some that go from 5-85, some bows like the Mathews are draw and draw weight specific for the user, mine is a Mathews Ignition set at 24 draw and 40 draw poundage it can only go up to 50 poundage i wont need anything more or less for what im going to hunt.  ||||| What kind of bow are you looking for? Compound, Recurve, Longbow? ||||| Hit your local archery shops for a start. You will probably find one that you like better than the others. Some will try to fit your budget, some will try to push you to spend more. I would recommend staying away from chains such as bass pro if possible. Service is a big consideration when buying a new compound if you don't have the ability to service it yourself. See what brands they carry at your favorite dealers and see what models fit your budget. You can certainly find a very nice setup in the $500 range. Keep in mind that even if you get a 'ready to shoot' bow package, you'll still need to buy arrows, broadheads, and a release so leave some room.  There will be fanboys who will push particular brands toward you because *they* prefer them, but really there are many quality bow brands out there. In your price range I'd look at PSE, Diamond, Mission, and Parker. Of course there are some I'm leaving out too.  ||||| The hot package these days is:   The Diamond Infinite Edge, for it's light weight, draw length adjustability and pull weight adjustability, and it's accuracy.  Not too short a bow, 31 inches gives it some stability.  I see a lot of young people and their parents start out with this bow, because you can grow into it.  Increasing your pull weight as you get stronger.  I would not start with a top of the line $999 bow as a beginner, as their really meant for an archer who is pulling 60 lbs.  [URL]  Hunters friend is a great site for learning about what's available. However, I think you should still take some archery lessons in a store near you, and get fitted in a local store.  You really need someone with experience setting you up.  You should drop in to a store every couple of months to be sure you haven't developed any bad habits.

So the Lords to the south might not believe them. ||||| The Night's Watch sent out Ravens to everyone they could think of in Season 3, but their cries for help are ignored by everyone for a bunch of reasons:  1. The Night's Watch is *constantly* asking for more men.  Regardless of the fact that they actually do need more men most of the time, the Lords are tired of hearing it.  This message is particularly desperate, but most people brush it off as simply yet another request for able bodies.  2. No one in the South believes them.  They don't believe the Wildlings are capable of organizing that kind of army, and everyone knows that Giants/White Walkers/Zombies don't actually exist.  The Night's Watch must be making a big deal out of nothing in order to get more men.  3. Even if the request is genuine and the Wildling army is a threat and the fantastical tales of magical creatures are true... the North is so very far away.  It is someone else's problem.  There is a deleted scene from Season 3 where the Small Council in King's Landing is discussing the Wildling problem and Tywin specifically states that if the Wildlings invade the North it will be *good* for their cause because it will be something else that Robb and his forces have to deal with.  4. Everyone in the South are busy fighting their own wars and dealing with their own problems.  Even if they (a) believe the Night's Watch and (b) want to help, they can't spare any fighting men to go help someone else.  All that said... there is a scene at the end of Season 3 where Davos is learning to read and he comes across the message from the Night's Watch.  So far it seems he is the only person in Westeros outside of Castle Black who actually takes the threat seriously.
4308	1,3,3,3	8	So, about a year and half ago, I wrote up my letter of defection and was ready to send it off, except I told my mom/she found out(was asking her where I was baptised and she wanted to know why) and she wanted me to promise her that I wouldn´t send it in, until she had died and three days have passed (incase she resurrects). I don´t remember if I actually promised her or not ... I do not that everything she brings it up I just don´t respond.   The only reason why I haven´t sent it in yet, is because she´s actually a kind-hearted person, believes in gay marriage and loves reading about other religions. I kinda don´t want to hurt her, but at the same time, she refuses to believe that I don´t believe in her god. I´ve told it to her many times, and she always gives me the "you´re going to hell for that" "that´s the devil talking". (which is better than my dad and grandma who wanted to take me to a priest when I told them I was leaving the church)  And I´ve told her that if I were to somehow accept her god back into my life, I´d become Bahá'í, because there´s no way I´m going back to the Catholic church, and she´s perfectly fine with that. And she accepts me being Buddhist, because she believes the two aren´t contradictory (even though Buddhism/Budda is partially why I left the church).  It does both me incredibly to know that I´m in the church records, and I know one number isn´t going to make a difference, but it´s still my number and I don´t want to be affiliated with such a homophobic, sexist, etc. church.  But ... I wonder if me sending in my letter of defection would bother my mom more than having my name be in the church records.  What do you /r/excatholic-ors think of my situation?     **Update:** okay, I wrote a long letter today, getting all my thoughts out and trying to be not offensive/kind and level headed about the whole thing and I read it off to her (because if I didn´t, I would´ve forgotten half the things I wanted to say).    Basically it outlined my issues with the catholic church (I guess I´ll post it at the end if you´re curious), gay marriage, male only hierarchy, excommunication over abortion and rapist get´s nothing(and vatican supporting the decision), aids being disease from their god, condemning people to hell for everything, etc.--nothing to do with the fact that I don´t believe in their god, because that´s what my mom has the most trouble with. And summarising that my leaving the Catholic church has nothing to do not being in their god or being an atheist, in fact if I still believed in their god, I still would not be comfortable being affiliated with such an institution.   Her first response afterwards was "do you believe in God?" Which bothered me, because seven years back, I needed a reference from a church friend who knew me really well, and when I asked her if she would do it for me (I was 16) she said "are you coming back to the church?". Anywho, she didn´t want to drop the subject and tried to convince me that I should believe in her god.  Eventually I got us away from the topic of my faith, and in the end, she was comfortable with me sending the letter on a few conditions:  * It would have to go to the bishop from the area in which I was baptised. (not our current bishop) * It must have my address in Germany, not my home address * It cannot mention my transition (I´m a transwoman--and the Church has my old boy name in their records, which should be interesting) because she was worried it would be traced back to her and they would excommunicate her.   So, progress is progress is win? She´s fine with (and I won´t hurt her by) me defecting. She is worried about it coming back to her though, which I can understand (she taught precaina and is a eucharistic minister, etc). ||||| Don't tie your faith or lack of it to someone else (this is one of the major points that led me to leave the church). I just made my mother realize that she could not control me, and that for lack of a better word, "she tried."  Catholic doctrine is that in order to be a good Catholic your children must be good Catholics.  IMNSHO any faith that hinges your status on someone else's faith is **wrong** full stop. ||||| Listen, one number might not seem like it will make a difference in crippling the power of the catholic church, but when you make posts HERE on /r/excatholic, people see them. People in the closet see them. And when they see these posts, it gives them hope. "Someday, even I will be able to make a post about sending in my defection letter". And eventually, they will send in letters of their own and give us the numbers we need.  This is an interesting story- lets hear the end of it   ||||| If i were you, I would send it in. You say that you're only "one person" and that you leaving woudnt make that much of a difference. I'm also having difficulty re; my letter, therefore, that is **two** people who are trying to leave the church. I'm sure there's many, many more like us.   you're never just one person to make a difference :)  Anyway, what's the point of being a member of the church if you just don't believe?!? It's like going to the shop every day, and buying a loaf of bread, but never eating it. The shop doesnt care what you do with the bread as long as it's being sold (i.e, on the register) So, stop buying the bread :P   I hope eventually there'll be something done to make it easier to leave.. You're only lying to yourself being tied up with this damn church. Try and be free, and one day, all us former Catholics can breathe a sigh of relief and never have to worry about religion again :) Good luck....
7771	1,3,3,3,3	7	My sex drive had been shot, shanked, and then curb stomped by work the past few months (my boss was a energy vampire Tyrant that makes everything horrible for everyone around her). But now that I've been laid off, I feel so much better. My energy is returning, I feel happier, and I began to actually feel horny again.  Horrible thing is, I got sick a few weeks ago from my coworker, and then this past week my SO got sick.  Yesterday I texted him with the intention of having a little bit of fun later, but I was turned down, because he felt "meh". Not unusual, mainly because he's still sick, even though we're both in the "getting over it" stage of the sickness. But he then told me that maybe being more impulsive would help get him back in the mood more often.  Problem is, I have no ideas on what to do. We're waiting until we move out to have penetrative sex (because we both still live at home and we're always at his house when we get down), so that's not an option. But I need sexy, innovated ideas.  Help me, Sexxit. You're my only hope. ||||| Try teasing him whenever you see him...act like you want to jump his bones, pull him into secluded areas for make-out sessions, grind against him suggestively, feel him up through his pants. While doing so, tell him how you can't wait for when you can move out, how badly you want him, etc.  When you're not around him, tease him through text messages, phone calls, e-mail, etc. Remind him of the sexy sessions you engaged in earlier ("I can't stop thinking about last night"), and build anticipation ("I can't wait to see you later and do *insert sexual act*"). Send pics of you wearing sexy lingerie, bra/undies, or completely nude.  Have fun :) ||||| maybe read through some of the quiz at [URL]  A search of r/sex might go a long way  Give him a hand job with some unusual lube or object  Google up some sex challenges along the line of give a bj without using your hands.  Tie him up and or blindfold him  So... maybe those things.... ||||| Not easy when living with others, but having him come home to you lying in his bed in lingerie will certainly get him going. Then of course there's all sorts of toys you could bring home like blindfolds or handcuffs. Take a look at your local sex shop maybe you'll find something to spark your interest.   Also that mojoupgrade site is awesome. ||||| Whatever comes into your mind, go with it and don't hold back. 
1590	1,3,3,3	9	[URL] Hello,  For the above problem I understand the general concepts (because R1 and R are parallel to each other we know the voltage drop across them is equal, and the same thing with R2 and R3, therefore we can set I1R1=IR, and I2R2=I3R3), however what I'm having trouble figuring out is how come we can say that they all proportional to each other ((I2R2/I1R1)=(I3R3/IR)) ||||| It's not R1 and R [and R2 and R3] which are parallel, rather R1+R2 is parallel with R+R3. With that in mind and taking into account for equal voltage drop, we set up [I being current flow] I_top x (R1+R2) [R1+R2 being the total resistance] is equal to I_bottom x (R+R3)  I_top x (R1+R2)=I_bottom x (R3+R)  We are asked in what circumstance would the voltage not be different after the first set of resistors. This means that, if there were a wire place, a net 0 current would flow toward and downward. Because current flows to components of lower voltages [i.e. the principle dictating equal voltage drop in the first place], the voltages at R and R1 must be equal for the voltmeter to read zero; and because current in series is conserved (else, where would the electrons have gone), I_top x (R1) must equal I_bottom x (R)  Solve for R with:  I_top x (R1+R2) = I_bottom x (R3+R)  I_top x (R1) = I_bottom x (R)  Hope that helps! ||||| This is the only question in the entire AAMC section bank packet that I had no clue how to do, read the solution, and was still flabbergasted. Just thought you'd want to know that you aren't the only one who found this question difficult. Thankfully, I don't remember my exam having any circuits.

9222	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	14	Just watching Neal at work is simply astonishing, he has a certain way with people. From art forgery to blending himself into any facility is remarkable. Also I'm quite fascinated by the knowledge that Mozzie and Neal possess, are there any books that relate to their mindset and strategic thinking? I'm usually not the book kinda guy but watching these two at work makes me want to read and gain some knowledge. ||||| You should check out /r/SocialEngineering . It relates to manipulating people (harmlessly, as far as I can tell) like Neal often does in White Collar. Manipulating them into letting him into places he shouldn't be, telling him info they shouldn't, etc. Apollo Robbins has a TED talk [here]([URL] about the art of misdirection, which Neal often employs as well, especially when pickpocketing or catching glimpses of day planners and people's schedules. Apollo Robbins also has other videos on youtube for pickpocketing and lying.     I've heard of one art forger and confidence man named Andy Behrman. He wrote a book called Electroboy, and has a website of the same name. He was similar to Neal, but not entirely like him. Maybe like Neal, but on a constant bender and also dealing with a mood disorder.     Hope this helps answer at least part of your question. ||||| The movie Catch Me If You Can is based on Frank Abagnale, who inspired Neal Caffrey. Neal is essentially Batman, though. He always has the skills that he needs, regardless of how rare they are in the real world. I'd rate him as possible, but not plausible.  ||||| [Gerald Blanchard - Infamous because of the sisi star heist]([URL] One of the episodes even used his story as a plot device, IIRC. Fascinating read nonetheless. ||||| Yes and no. There are people who are escape artists. There are people that are fantastic art forgers. Some people are break-in experts.  Most aren't usually all in one body though. ||||| It's a certain combination of natural intelligence and ruthlessness. A lot of what Neal and Mozzie do causes some collateral damage that would stop normal people on their tracks.  As far as people being as astonishingly gifted as Neal, there's many famous individuals who I think stand toe to toe with him(well, before they started throwing random skills on Neal when the writers wrote themselves in a corner).   Dolph Lundgren(yes that one) is a succesful actor,black belt in Karate, has a master's degree in chemical engineering, fluent in several languages, and there were rumors he has an IQ of 160.  Viggo from the LOTR is fluent in four languages,writer,poet, an accomplished painter and musician, a world-class photographer, and of course an incredibly succesful actor.  And those are famous individuals, there's plenty of gifted individuals throught out the globe who just happen to not be famous or would rather live a private life. ||||| Look up Frank Abagnale Jr. He wrote a book that was made into a movie. The movie stared Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken. The book is must read for anyone interested in the whole conman type crimes.  ||||| There was an AMA once with a person like Neal Caffrey. I tried to search for it but found out the user deleted his account. Here is what I found though. A cached copy of the AMA.  [URL] ||||| There's a great show on MSNBC that Stacey Keach narrates called "American Greed" that details some of the greatest schemes in recent American history.

Both Penn Jillette and Ed McMahon were once "carnies" who suckered rubes.  Ed worked in jam auctions for many years. ||||| [One of my favorite social engineers and hackers, Kevin Mitnick]([URL] ||||| This is one of the most interesting aspects of the show, the almost superhero-like powers they seem to have that are entirely plausible and, yet, unlikely.  The flavor-of-the-decade on procedural(ish) shows like this seems to be the use of consultants by law enforcement. I wonder how many of those there really are? Would the FBI ever really have someone like Neal play such an active, front-lines role in investigations? I highly doubt it... but it makes for great TV.

2243	1,3	3	My small business is located in Ashland OR.  I’ve been using “hosted” VOIP services for about 5 years now… started with Vonage then went to 8x8, then Aptella then to Vocalocity (3 yrs ago)... which was recently bought by Vonage. Go figure.  We use 3 unlimited extensions, efax, 1 call queue, auto attendant, voicemail to email… typical hosted VOIP stuff.   I recently changed to a Charter Business cable internet connect because I wanted a static IP for a server here in the office.  They installed a Ubee cable modem / router.  VOIP reliability has suffered since.  Vonage says the Ubee is not compatible unless it is in bridge mode.  Charter says it is already in bridge mode.  I won’t win this pissing match.   Here are the options I’m considering:  1 Get a Century Link DSL connection dedicated to the phones.  12meg down 4 up.  2 Get a Century Link DSL connection dedicated to the phones AND dump Vonage.  Their customer support blows compared to Vocalocity pre-merger.  Any recommendations on who to replace them with?    3 Get SIP Trunking service from charter,  plus….  I have no idea.  With my limited understanding, I believe that getting SIP trunks from Charter represents a very short hop to a “real” phone network.  I don’t know what other pieces I need to add to have a working phone system.    Thank you for any feedback or suggestions.  TLDR: Charter Business connection + Vocalocity  = fail.   Would I have more reliable service if I get sip trunking service from Charter and brewed my own?  What do I need in addition to sip trunk?  Any suggestions for other options? ||||| I'd start with option 1.  It never hurts to have a second internet connection.  I think you could go with a slower speed plan, 12x4 is pretty big for just 4 phones.
3018	1,2,3,3,3,2	18	Hey guys. Wondering if anyone went through the same issue. For over a week now I've been tearing my hair out in frustration over this. I read every thread on summon tips. Using a complex password, worlwide, ring small bell first, resetting game, resetting ps4, resetting modem, trying both wired and wifi, and not a damn thing works. I used to play with two friends, and now neither one can summon me, but I can summon both no problem. They still summon each other with no issue. Can anyone offer any insight into this problem?  UPDATE: Forwarded all required ports and tried removing oath runes. Nothing worked. ||||| Are you within level range?   A level 4 can summon a level 500 with a password but a level 500 cannot summon a level 4.   It only scales downwards so if you are not within level range (i think its 10 levels + 10% and may get wider the higher the level) you wont be able to be summoned. ||||| Log on to router, DMZ PS. ||||| In case it hasn't been said, sometimes it just takes time. Try running out of the immediate area then back to it. It's taken me 15+mins to get a friend in before. ||||| Unfortunately, I had this same problem, and was never able to get it fixed.

3233	1,3	4	I've posted this in a few individual threads over the past year or so, and felt it was deserving of its own thread in case it can help a few more fellow Canucks save some money.  I'm not affiliated with Memory Express in any way, but I have been using them quite extensively and can vouch for their service, speedy delivery, and amazing price beat policy.  **Process**  Basically you start with your PCPartPicker list as your normally would, but when you are ready to buy, click on every item and check to see if it's available (in-stock) at memoryexpress, even if it's not the lowest price. Add all of the available items to your cart.  Sometimes when I'm having trouble deciding between some items (namely RAM or motherboard) I will pick the one that's available at MemEx.  When you are finished, go to your cart, and there will be a button next to each entry for price beat request. Go back to PCPartPicker, get the lowest price for your item, and then enter that into the "Competitor's Price" field. You will also need to enter the URL to the item showing the price and that it's in stock. This has to be the competitor's website, not the PCPP link.  Memory Express will then beat the price by 25% of the difference. So, if NCIX is having a sale and charging $139.99 but it's regular $189.99 at MemEx, MemEx will give it to you for $127.49 ($139.99 - 25% of $50).  Do this for your whole order and you will find yourself saving a few bucks on each item. If you're buying 7-8 items you can usually save about $50, sometimes less sometimes more.  Their fee for shipping is then $8.99 flat to anywhere in Canada, so you only pay 1 shipping fee.  **Personal Experience**  [I have purchased over $10,000 worth of items from Memory Express]([URL] and one of the things that pleased me the most is that I've never once been contacted because a price beat couldn't be done - and I put a price beat request on about 90% of my items. A lot of times with other places that price match they will deny it or say "lowest we can go is X", but MemEx has always just approved and shipped, assuming the item's price was correct and in stock. MemoryExpress' system automatically screenshots all of the pages when you submit your order, so you don't have to worry about the competitor's price or stock level changing before it's processed.  I've also had to return items for RMA twice, and that process has always been quick and flawless. One was a DOA motherboard for which I received a replacement, the other was a DOA Wi-Fi adapter for which I got a full refund (no restocking fee). Both times they covered the cost of the shipping label and there was 0 hassle. Refund was issued in less than one week from sending out the parcel. ||||| Good to know. I usually go through Newegg because I find that ME shipping takes forever but I will keep this in mind, maybe with the money I save I'll opt for UPS vs. Canada post

Does Biyombo have an edge over him or is it the other way around? ||||| I think they are quite equal players in terms of overall value, though their skills differ.   In a 'fair' market situation both players are probably paid nearly equally at around $10m a season under next year's cap.    Expect TT to play at his fullest potential at the ACC. He always seems to find an extra gear there. Hopefully JV will be back by then though. ||||| He's probably not better, although Tristan gets to receive passes from LeBron and not DeRozan. But there's no doubt that Biyombo's a way better value.  ||||| No ||||| I think Thompson is probably a bit better. He hustles hard just like BB, he's taller so he may have an advantage on the glass, plus he excels at offensive boards. As well, he's a bit more polished on offense, and could probably score more points on any given night than Biyombo.   BB is better when it comes to actually guarding his man and protecting the rim though, which is what we ask of him

8441	1,3	5	I got a windfall in 2015.  I spent about half of it on car parts because I love cars and want to restore a few old ones, build a few custom ones, sell a few to make some profit and keep the venture self-sustaining, and I'm not really sure (honestly) if that makes me a business to-be or if I will back off from this and get tired of it or what.  I had no employees.  I personally invested between 10-20 hours per week in this, not just in 2015 but in the last 5 years, though in no years did I have any income except 2015 I sold a few parts to buy new parts (2009-2014 it was nominal compared to '15 so I considered all as personal expenses and never deducted anything).  It is NOT a hobby, it is a lifestyle, I am obsessed my wife hates me spending so much time with it etc etc. I have not made a cent of "profit" in 2015 but I was figuring I could/would in 2016 or 2017, though I don't foresee spending anywhere near as much in 2016 or 2017 as I did in 2015.  I am truly not decided if I want this to be a business or not.  I don't even know if I can legally sell more than 1 car without being a car dealer, technically (get a license or register the business or whatever).  Everything I read seems contradictory for me.  I am not trying to sound all special-snowflake but please point me toward how I can figure this out.    I am obviously going to report the income on schedule C.  I don't know if the 1/2 of income I put toward my car venture is expenses for a future business or just personal for now and maybe later I re-do that if I am a 100% committed business, or if it counts as investment if the "inventory" of antique or valuable parts without me actually assembling and testing and then selling whole cars.

3242	1,3,3	5	Hi, I'm pretty much set to build with this setup. I just need some validation on the 1440p 60hz monitor I purchased, and the case choice. I might send the case back when it arrives and get a Define R4 because of the noise control and more understated look.  If I want to play something like TF2/CS:GO will the 60hz refresh be hindering essential fps in any way?  And does anyone have experience adding additional external fan filters to the front intakes?

8335	1,2,3,3,2,3	11	[deleted] ||||| What's the point in a spoiler tag if you put the spoiler in the fucking title?? ||||| First of all force sensitivity is not a perfect science. A force sensitive isn't all knowing, and the ability to sense someone's intentions that Jaesa has is considered rare. On top of that, the Voss don't use the force in the traditional way. Their force power is mostly demonstrated through difficult to interpret visions, and they don't have visions about every little thing, so if they didn't have a vision about an imperial infiltrator there would be no reason for them to suspect Bas-Ton was anything but Voss. Plus the guy owned a tea shop, it's not like he was one of the three ||||| The ability to see the future for Jedi is especially unpredictable because the more chaotic the environment the harder it is to follow the currents of the force. Dark Siders like Sith use this to their advantage to create false visions or even blind Jedi completely. Much like Palpatine and his agents did to the Jedi Council by creating more and more conflict during the Clone Wars to hide the enemy in plain sight.  Voss don't 'see' the future - they see bits and pieces that have been compressed into visions. The accuracy of their visions gives them site into a wider goal but there are many 'little pieces' that they miss - which is how the whole Gormak mess and the resulting conflict on their planet came about. The Jedi are wary of Force Visions and even the Sith are willing to discount them (for some sith the idea of their future being 'guided' would be laughable if not insulting) mainly because most force sensitives (apart from prodigies like Anakin, Jaesa, Palpatine, Luke etc) aren't bombarded with constant visions OR able to access potential futures at will.   The future of the Clone Wars era was shrouded in unpredictability and darkness by two Sith Lords and a war conducted primarily in the outer regions. Imagine how hard the future must be to predict NOW that the entire galaxy is at war and there are thousands - if not hundreds of thousands - of Jedi and Sith going at it 24/7. Couple to that the fact that the Voss don't see 'the future' so much as a blurry picture of it that mainly is focused on ensuring their own survival and nothing else; there's no wonder they didn't know who Bas-Ton was. ||||| How do they not realize they are related to the Gormak? The force should tell them so.   Or maybe even a tiny bit of DNA testing.  ||||| Voss are Mary-Sues. As such, they are only as awesome as the story needs them to be, and certain aspects get overlooked in favour of the larger story.

2121	1,3,3	5	I just got my Surface Pro 3 i5 256GB earlier this month and noticed the Type Cover did not have a Numeric Pad which I have become so reliant on for all my Excel based work at the office and at school. I created [this post here on Reddit.com/r/Surface]([URL] hoping to find some options and came to the conclusion that there were only roughly 3 black bluetooth 10-key pads on the market. ZAGG had just released this 10-key bluetooth pad I believe in October 2014 after seeing [this article]([URL] I chose this as it was the most simplistic, thinnest, lightest, cleanest, and cheapest of the options I was stuck with, it seemed to be a perfect accessory for me. Anyway let's get to the pictures.     I purchased it from ZAGG's website, here is a [direct link to the product]([URL]      [Album Here]([URL]    As you can see it was an easy removal from the packaging, it comes with a micro USB cord for charging. I tried to turn it on immediately and pair it with my SP3, but it appeared to be dead so I plugged it into the USB at first (it felt difficult at first to plug it in but with effort it will fit snug, I noticed that the female micro USB connector within the keypad was rather loose, so I'm hoping not to play with it too much, as it's probably one build flaw that will fail in the near future)     Setting it up was simple, pairing it with bluetooth is self-explanatory, at times it is name "Keyboard" other times it is "ZAGG 10 Key". If it is having issues pairing via bluetooth, connecting it with the micro USB first and then pairing it helped in one instance. I went straight into Excel and tested it, but noticed none of the numbers were working. I did a quick search to find out how to activate Num Lock as there is no Num Lock key on either the Type Cover or the ZAGG Keypad. Thanks to [Wykkyd ]([URL] for posting the solution on the [SurfaceForums.net post "Num Lock" thread]([URL] It worked!       I thought everything was great now, however there was one issue that I hope to resolve soon. The equal (=) key doesn't work. By using [Keyboard Tester]([URL] I was able to verify that all keys except the equal sign was working, and the Del key works as Backspace. Perhaps somebody can help us figure this out, if not, i'll bring it up to ZAGG.     For my comment on the overall build of it, it's extremely lightweight and feels of a soft plastic sort of like those universal TV remotes. The keys themselves feel crisp and not loose or ridiculously cheap, they feel close enough to the Type Cover to feel like a genuine product imo. Perhaps an optional mini stand to angle it at the same degree of the Type Cover might be interesting, but of course this ZAGG product wasn't designed for the Surface. If you can't see in the photos it is about as tall as my Arc Touch Mouse when it's flat and turned off. I love how slim it is, lightweight, black, and most of all wireless as it adds to the portability of the Surface Pro 3 and compliments the shade of the Type Cover's black keys well. Being able to adjust the location of a 10-key pad in your work-space without wires feels like a luxury! Good job ZAGG!        For the price, it appeared worth it and so far it feels worth it. I've heard of their customer service not being top-notch so I'm hoping for a response to my previous ticket about the lack of a tracking number (surprisingly it came in later in the day after I requested for support). I'll keep this post updated if anything comes up regarding the keypad. Thanks for reading my ridiculously long post as I'm not going to make a tl;dr. Enjoy Surface-ers!  ||||| [deleted] ||||| I came here to post a question about my Zagg not working and thinking it was because I needed to turn on number lock somehow.

982	1,2,3,3,3,3	7	I know that bungie said that elemental primaries are on their way out, but this week's nightfall with the epic modifier made me realize just how much I miss year one goods.  That being said, I think that there are some clever ways that Bungie could keep implementing elementals without having them be broken.    At the moment, the only incentive towards getting hard raid primaries is the higher attack value, (and black color scheme if that's your style).  What if there was another node on the hard mode primaries called 'element bearer'.  It would cost 50 legendary marks to activate, and once activated it would act similarly to the ether seeds or black wax idols.  Basically, you would have an element on your primary for 10 minutes.  If you run out, you buy it again.  This gives us not only more incentive to grind out hard raid guns, but also more incentive to go and earn legendary marks.   ||||| 50 legendary marks for 10 minutes seems almost not worth it, Maybe 50 marks and you get an element for the week? a few days maybe? ||||| They already fixed elemental primaries, by making them exotic and mediocre(balanced). I don't use the Zhalos other then an Arc Nightfall as opposed to year 1 where i was using an arc primary weapon everytime i logged in to play. At this point they could easily introduce a solar and void exotic primary and most likely yield the same result. ||||| Let elemental die. Taken elemental primaries out of the equation has made exotic and other legendaries more usable. A lot of variety now.  ||||| Have the legendary planetary materials become a drop outside of the sword quest. Get X of that element. Go to gunsmith at rank Y. Can infuse 1 primary/weapon with that element per week and do not lose the element. 5000 glimmer, 30 marks, 50 weapon parts, and X material (10/15/20/25, potentially more with each element shift). Makes all primaries possible to have a element without there needing to be a wall for elements.  Cons to this is that it would invalidate the non-elemental damage guns, meaning bungie would have to make weird balance changes based on possible modifiers. So unlikely to happen but I think this would be a balanced system to reintroduce elemental primaries. ||||| Why not just add a nightfall modifier in junction with the burn. example: Arc infusion: "all kinetic weapons do arc damage while in nightfall strike." knowing bungie, they would make it random so you could end up with arc infusion and void burn lol.

4375	1,3,3,3,3	7	  ||||| When you hear someone elses voice, you are picking up on the vibrations they are sending through the air. The same applies to video cameras or microphones recording you. However, when you hear yourself talk in real life you aren't picking up only the vibrations in the air, but also the vibrations in your head and skull, caused by your vibrating vocal chords. Those extra vibrations change how you hear yourself, and how you think you sound when you talk. Everyone else around you is getting a different set of vibrations when you speak than you yourself are. ||||| When you talk you're hearing and feeling your throat and bones vibrating, which makes your voice sound deeper and fuller than what everyone else hears.  ||||| I personally think it's the doppler effect. When something is far the frequency is slower and thus bass(ier) but when something is near the frequency increases and thus the pitch is higher, since your ears are the receiver and your entire head is the sound emitter your voice pitch should be higher to you and deeper to others.  ||||| In your head you are always hearing the best and ideal version of your voice. Sometimes your real voice is a lot lower than you think and you wouldn't notice until someone plays it back to you.  Source: I've thought about this a lot. Also I'm a singer.
8080	1,3,3	6	I hope that makes sense. I was ask to join and watch a replay of two players. I want to re  watch that replay however I cannot find it anywhere in my folders. ||||| Nowhere, you need to use "resume from replay". You can do that when the host left, you just resume at the end of the replay and quit, it will save it.  I have forgotten quite a few times to do that and lost replays I would have wanted to keep :( ||||| It doesn't get saved
8385	1,3	5	I'd like to ask if windows 8 tablets with built-in 3G modems can make/receive phone calls and receive/send SMS messages like a normal cellphone without using 3rd party applications such as Viber and Skype?I'm kind of looking at Lenovo Miix 2 because of it. Thanks! ||||| There is no functionality provided in Windows to perform this, no.  Some 3G modems can be used as SMS/Call devices, but it requires third party software. I have only ever seen Huawei dongles supporting the feature. You will have to check the chipset used as to whether any software is available.
926	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	13	I just beat Dark souls 2 Sotfs for the first time! Now I'm just looking for any tips on running a no death run.  ||||| The best tip is to not get killed ||||| A good shield helps.  Not only will you be able to turtle attacks, if you're feeling ballsy, you can parry and riposte enemies to get them out of the way faster.  If you don't feel like playing melee, sit back behind a wall of Soul Arrows.  No swordplay required.  Keep your distance and spam magic.  A Bow is also good for cheesing things you don't think you can fight at close range. ||||| Watch a speedrun. Speedrunners always do no-death no-bonfire (otherwise you're kind of slowed down), and usually know the fastest way to get to the end of the game with minimal effort. You know, assuming learning to time rolls and jumps perfectly is minimal. ||||| I just did no death/no bonfire run. And It was really hard. If you consider doing only no death run, then it may be easier, because you can regain estus at bonfires and also warp bank and fro. Also, as someone mentioned, greatshield and bow are your friends. Especially bow.  Dont forget to play offline, because you dont want to get invaded.  Furthermore, it is not necessary to kill four main bosses to get through shrine of amana. You just have to get enough souls during this playthrough (maybe 2mil in ng+). Lastly, depending on how honest you are, there is a cheese, that makes this run significantly easier.  I hope that helps.  ||||| Git gud  ||||| I finished my first no death run yesterday. I got through the whole thing with a fully upgraded rapier and club, and a short bow. Having poison arrows against BS enemies like the drake keepers in dragon aerie is a good method. Lightning arrows were a life saver in shrine of amana. Use the club on any armored enemies and then the rapier on everything else. I beat the game in two hours using this method, and that was taking my time. In order of boss/area I went:  * Dragon rider cheese  * Last Giant  * Pursuer  * Flexile sentry  * Sentinels  * Sinner (I went in this order to collect yore branches in all these areas)  * Najka (I went through shaded woods so I can access upgrade materials and the second dragon ring fastest)  * Prowling magus congregation or whatever, then Freja after collecting all the chunks in the area  * The rotten, because by now you've got a fully upgrade rapier and a decent amount of health. It gets you bone dust, estus, and two yore branches to come down here.    * Huntsman's copse and earthen peak and blah blah, then iron keep. In iron keep I skipped smelty, went straight to the eygil's idol bonfire, and fought the old iron King.   * Drangleic, go through that area normally  * Shrine of amana, be extremely cautious and abuse the hell out of your bow  * Undead crypt I went through pretty normally  * As soon as you get the Kings ring, go fight the dynamic duo in Drangleic. This way, you don't get two boss fights at once after the Giants kinship  * going through aldia's keep is normal, but afterward do not risk going through the dragon aerie optional area. Avoid any unnecessary risks on a no death run. Do it after you've beat the game  * Bow cheese every single enemy until you get the third dragon ring and ashen mist heart  * Go straight to the last giant, then go fight Nashandra and boom you got a ring of a conqueror.   Tips: use NPCs, but only the useful ones. Having too many of them at once will only make the boss harder. I went in this particular order because I like having Benhart and Vengarl at my disposal, as well as for the sake of getting fragrant branches in a particular order, but it doesn't matter what order you get the four great souls in. Make sure you buy lightning resins, because pretty much any boss is weak to lightning. Also, bright bugs can be your best friend. I'd also recommend patience and EXTRA CAUTION. Don't do optional bosses or areas unless they're low risk. Upgrade your weapons as fast as possible, invest in agility as soon as possible, and have plenty of health. 20 endurance is all I needed to get through the game.   Last but not least, PLAY THE GAME OFFLINE.

Assuming you're talking about a desktop, you can purchase a dedicated graphics card, which is what the majority of PC gamers will use. Recommend you look into the likes of a R9 270x or the GTX 760. ||||| You can get a dedicated GPU (graphics card/videocard) yes ||||| You can update your drivers and see if it increases your performance. ||||| Rule #5: No tech support questions
3576	1,3,3	7	We use an old internally developed Java app in house here. The source code is nowhere to be found and we need to alter some config files which have sensitive parameters obfuscated.

Thanks for the help! ||||| Removing all the padding and treating the remaining groups of 28 and 30 characters as hex, then converting those to decimal values, we get:      [61, 177, 32, 179, 180, 56, 181, 8, 0, 167, 54, 202, 198, 14] = apiuser  There's exactly twice as many values as characters.

9368	1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	I get about 1-3 hours every other day to play games, and my favorite platform is PC. I enjoy online multiplayer, and I play League of Legends. However, in a game of League, your role only lasts ~40 minutes, and then that game is over. I'm attracted to WoW because I'd like to have a character I can grow and improve over a long time, gradually. But in the current meta, can I have a fulfilling experience in WoW without a ton of time to dungeon dive or raid? ||||| [deleted] ||||| Of course! Not everyone who plays WoW plays hardcore. When you hit level cap, you can level alts or do acheivements and treat it like a skyrim like experience. If you do join, and are US, I have a guild on Alexstrasza alliance that is very casual. Would love to have you,. ||||| You are the main target group of Blizzard.  ||||| If you're into exploration and love that feeling of wanderlust, casually playing WoW will be well worth it.  ||||| The game is extremely casual friendly. In general, the people you hear on forums and online resources are enfranchised hardcore-ish people, but they don't represent the community as a whole. There's a ton of casual people, but you don't notice them as much because they're... casual :p  A lot of people just level up their characters to level cap, then start on a new character to level. I personally get my characters to cap, then start "transmog progression" where I do old dungeons for nice-looking gear for my characters. But basically, yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can do in this game and have a good time with! ||||| There's a place for you: dead on the road in skettis. Bwahahaha! ||||| If you like playing casually, this game could last a veeery long time for ya. There's plenty of casual things to do (pets, mounts, leveling, questing, professions, gold-making, exploring, achievements, easy-mode dungeon/LFR) ||||| Yes, you can absolutely have a fulfilling experience. The only thing you'll maybe miss out on is raiding with a guild. Raids generally take 2-3 hours, at a specific, scheduled time. If you can find a guild whose schedule works for you, then you'll be able to do everything.  Dungeons are quick, maybe 15 mins depending on your group. Hell, can do some of them in 5 mins if you're really really quick, but if the groups sucks, might take longer, more like 30 mins. LFRs (non-guild raiding) take 20-30 minutes each, some are quicker. PvP battlegrounds take 15 or so minutes as well. I can't think of anything that is a dedicated time slot that takes longer than 30 mins besides raiding. Now, many things take way longer than 30 mins, but you can do them at your leisure, you don't have to dedicate a specific time to them.  ||||| Definitely. Its not like when it first came out, its relatively easy to play casually now.  ||||| Absolutely!   Too many people fall into the trap of thinking that the (only) point of the game is to get to maximum level and run raids at the highest level.  Then they get hissy when they find you need lots of talented friends to do that, as well as a high level of personal skill. :)   Explore!  Don't miss out on seeing cool things as you progress through the game.   Do quests! They're a lot of fun and give you a reason to wander around. You can do these with friends if you like.   Run some dungeons once you're level 15. You'll need a thick skin 'cause some people forget what it was like to be new, but lots of people are nice too.  If you add those ones to your friends list, playing becomes more social. :)  Do your own thing, whatever that is. Kill all the critters, run battlegrounds, do pet battles, find the nicest place go fish, dress up in costumes (transmogrify your gear), do holiday events... whatever tickles your fancy. Or help a friend with something they want to do.   ||||| There is a shit load of stuff to do for a casual player, though I would argue there is less in Warlords of Draenor specifically than in other expansions to do for a casual player. ||||| MoP was a much better time to be casual imo, but you can still play as a casual player. 6.2 tries to fix a lot of this. We'll see how it goes. ||||| Absolutely.  I started playing in 2010 and have only played solo/casual. It's a really fun game and completely playable without having to do dungeon runs. But, At some point you'll want to give dungeons a chance and those will be fun to, and completely open up new things you'll want to try, such as tank specs, healing specs, etc.  Best part? If you're just going to go questing and adventuring and seeing the world one character at a time you can just stop whenever (well, once you're out of combat) and resume right then and there.  Nothing's been more 'holy shit' in my entire gaming experience when I leveled my first toon through ~ 20 levels and discovered that I had seen a small fraction of the world, experienced only 2 professions, all with just 1 class. THE GAME IS HUGE.  Since then, on my own time and all by myself (as in I never really knew of any friends that played) I've enjoyed most all races, classes, professions, dungeons, some raids. Currently I'm taking time enjoying the lore behind many of the zones and completing the quest lines as I try to get the achievements rewarding you for exploring and completing almost all quests in all zones. ||||| To be brutally honest, I wouldn't invest 15$ a month to play 1 to 3 hours every other day. That's just personal opinion though ||||| You absolutely can. It comes down to finding a right community of people to enjoy the game with. ||||| Well the game is the ultimate single player experience so yes you will be fine as a casual. ||||| The game has been practically re-tooled since vanilla to cater to the casual player. That's not to say that there are not still challenges to be had for the devoted, hard-core player, but Blizzard knows that is only a small fraction of the player-base and that they make the lion's share of their money on casual players. ||||| Level a character. All the way, do each zone in order until it is complete to see the story, then move to the next one. When your done with one faction, do the other the same way. This will allow you to immerse yourself in the lore and story, as well as see how wonderful the world is. Do not worry about the max level stuff. For the amount of time you can play, just leveling a character will be a wonderful experience.  ||||| I think so. I'm 32 and have two kids. I only get on for an hour or two when I can. If you like LoL and competitive online multiplayer, PvP might be right up your alley. It's currently all I do since I can't commit to a raid.   Give it a shot! If you're Horde on US, I'll join you!  ||||| My fiance and I are both casual players. We will go through spurts where we dont play at all for weeks, and then there will be time when we have an hour or 2 in the evening, more time on weekends, etc. We still enjoy it but don't let it consume our life either :-) we may be "behind" a lot of people but its just not as crowded that way! ||||| yes ofc more than 90% of the game is casual.
2697	1,3,3,3	7	So my friend just joined this facebook group  [Jesus' Birthday]([URL]  Which, while I don't want to jump in with some snide comment because we are still good friends, does annoy me. Christmas is a fun holiday which I enjoy with my family and friends, but it never held any religious meaning to me. The only 'religion' I ever got close to embracing were celtic pagan traditions (when I was young and still thought magic could be real... ah those were the days) but it led to me finding out about most of the bullshit the christian church pulled to convert pagans, like hijacking their Winter Solstice.  Anyway, I can respect christians wanting a date to *represent* the birth of Jesus, but groups like this just make me wonder how people can be so devoted to a religion that they are not even fully informed about! Also, I wondered about the theory of Jesus being an actual historical figure and if so the likelihood of finding out his actual birthday.  That led me to *this* gem of a site [Chapel Perilous]([URL] ||||| It's Mithra's birthday for fuck sake, who is this Jesus wanker? ||||| Thank you for that "gem."  It's rare to see so much wrongness packed into one page. ||||| I see ~8k "attending" and ~4k "not attending" - an event is an interesting choice because it's one of the few features on facebook that effectively has a negative option.

1760	1,3,3,3,3,3	6	Ive been wondering how to fill up this space effectively. I dont really know how to express my personality on paper without seeming boring.   And after reading these boards I'm even more confused on what to put down. Like "Don't list attributes. If you say "I am a nice, smart, and funny...", I automatically doubt that you are." So if I say im nice,funny or smart. I'm a dumb, unfunny asshole? How am I supposed to win that?   I would specifically like advice on how to better fallout the sections six things I cannot do without, I'm really good at  and I spend a lot of time thinking about. These seem to be just dumb questions, I'm pretty good at most things but I have no clue what to put here.   I've only messaged two people but I did get a response from both.When I message someone I try to be funny or say something about there interests. For example a girl said she dosent like guys who try to emulate the Jersey shore. So I assured her I've only been to the jersey shore once and, I didn't even get a tan. I got sun poisoning(all true).  Should I put stuff in my profile about what type of chick I'm looking for? Like if he cant hold a decent conversation or have a sense of humor I have no interest.  Any advice would be helpful.  **edit**: Im dumb and linked to this page. This is my profile. [URL]  **edit**: I'm also guessing I should post more pictures that are not just of my face.  ||||| For starters, you really need to proof read and check the flow of what you write.  "I lived in New York City till I was about sixteen" I would suggest changing 'till' to until.   This may only be a typo but it reads very poorly.  "I really laid back I tend to just go with the flow, no use in getting bent out of shape over stuff."  Also, I would change your default picture to something with a smile.  You look puzzled or something in your current image.    "I like to think I’m fairly intelligent and pretty funny, but I don't wanna sound full of myself."  As one of the recent threads suggested, don't say things like this.  Don't claim to be something, show them that you are intelligent and or funny.  Anyone can say they are funny not everyone actually is.   Definitely change your "I’m really good at" section what you have is a bad idea imo.   You are not talking do not write things like "Umm….."  I would actually remove that whole first part of your things people notice section but I think the accent thing is solid.   For the things you couldn't do with out, move friends to the number one slot, I know you may not have put them in order of priority but often people will read it that way.   Edit: I just recommended some changes through OKCupid. Some of it overlaps with what I wrote here.    ||||| It's hard but the idea behind not writing "I am a nice, smart, and funny" is the same as the old literary adage, "show, don't tell." If you're funny, your profile will be funny. But telling someone you are funny is not going to persuade.   You say "I like to think I’m fairly intelligent and pretty funny, but I don't wanna sound full of myself." but there is nothing to indicate either of those on here. The "I spend a lot of time thinking about" section is primed for this. A classic rule of three could be used here so you could say "Intelligent thing A, intelligent thing B, peanut butter" bosh and there you have something funny *and* intelligent. You've shown, not told. ||||| You looked stoned in your first picture.  ||||| Say you're a dumb, unfunny asshole.  Duh. ||||| 23/m?   dating sites are kinda like looking around the bar around 1am  it's only 10pm for you, homie

My late game minions were non existent but I was mage so I guess that doesn't matter too much lol ||||| Awesome job man. You must just play very well. That's a really nicely balanced deck but yeah, nothing insane or overpowered. That card pack was pretty god-awful though lol.. ||||| I agree that this deck isn't super powerful but to its credit, it's incredibly solid. Not many cards that are sub-par or anti-value. I've gotten twelve wins a fair number of times with decks that I felt were not "12-win decks" too. It's usually a result of solid playing but also a lot of luck. I'm assuming you didn't run into any super amazing 5 Truesilver, 3 Hammers of Wrath, 2 Tirion Pally decks? Also, helps that you have two Flamestrikes and that you're a Mage. :D
1786	1,3,3,3,3,3	6	I just recently got PES 2015 (I switched over from FIFA) and was wondering if anyone had any tips or tricks for keeping possession better.  In FIFA for instance you'd be able to protect the ball.  But with PES I can't find any such button and it seems my players get overwhelmed and lose the ball a lot.  Any time I receive a pass my players are seeming to take a big first touch (if I don't do a one time pass) and it just seems that I lose the ball too much if I'm dribbling with any defenders around me.  Was just wondering if any had some tips for controlling the ball in general more (I know R1/RB dribbles ball close to you but it does not really protect the ball well) Thanks! ||||| I feel your pain OP, im afraid of just having the ball now. ||||| Also in those situation don't use the sprint button but get yourself some space with the control stick by movement left and right and turning ... ||||| I never use the skills just the analog stick to weave through players  ||||| It's all about control with the analog stick, really. Think about what you're going to do before you do it. Think about the physical matchups between players and their other attributes. You're the one who has to protect it, not a button. When you do, it's a lot more rewarding. ||||| You're right, R1/RB doesn't really work. Use the right analog stick instead, to lean into or away from your opponent. I found it to be more intuitive once I got used to it, actually.

Play what YOU like, since that's what will keep you coming back.  ||||| Keep it for primed warframes or syncidate sacrifices. ||||| Trin without a doubt ||||| Well, which Warframes do you have, and which of those do you like playing the most? ||||| Valk, Banshee, RhinoP, MagP, Hydro  and Nek but I really don'r feel the Banshee. I also have Loki and Zeph but they came pretatoed. ||||| I just potato everything worth potato-ing. If it would last significantly longer in high(er) level missions with more mods, it gets a potato but most of all - if it's fun to use for a long time.

But to fully deliver, here's the gist of what I did:  Fully upgraded specs. Black windows. Black matte for primary color, lime green is secondary. Lime green tires.  When I originally spotted this I had just added lime green to my car. Just finished the jumps for the color. I went through every wheel type to see if I wanted to change. I didn't. I browsed all the primary paint colors to see what else needed to unlock. I tried pearlscent but the matte didn't let me. I gave it black tire smoke, exited, burnt some rubber, then went back in and changed it to green tire smoke. ||||| Looks black to me ||||| No but it sounds awesome.

6843	1,3,0,0,0,0,3	19	My friends and I decided to buy founders packs to play this game, the game specifically says you need to purchase a founders pack to play the damn game. Of course we all buy the 20$ founders pack. Only for the game to tell us we didn't even buy it. (as if something went wrong) We had to go online to actually find out that we payed for early access to a free game that we can't play until the 18th. This is some sneaky shit considering every other game on psn specifically states that you are preordering and when you can play the game. Call me dumb for blindly paying for something I didn't understand, but every other purchasable item on psn clearly informs you on what your getting and when you get it. I can wait a few days sure, but i feel scamed. (now confirmed to be psn fuckery voodoo black magic) ||||| The thing is with PSN. Normally it states that it is a pre order because you can't even start up the game before the release date. Here the game access it tied to your Epic Games account. Thats why it doesn't show it on the PSN Store.    >By purchasing a Founder’s Pack, you’ll be able to play March 18  2nd sentence on the purchase page [URL] ||||| Not to be a dick, but it helps to actually read before purchasing.  The very first sentence under the Paragon entry in the PS Store reads:   *'NOTE: A Founders Pack is required to gain entry to the Early Access available from March 18th   Paragon will become free to play during the summer of 2016.'*  On the official EpicGames page it reads (in big bold letters) under founder's pack:   *Buy a Founder’s Pack and play Paragon March 18*  So I don't know how you could've missed this info if you actually purchased/downloaded it. ||||| Do you not know how to read? It clearly states in multiple places and is pretty common knowledge that early access starts Friday. They did not mislead you. You simply didn't research your purchase properly. ||||| [empty] ||||| Damn you are sssaaaaallllttyyy. can you not wait like 2 days? some people have been waiting months to try and get early access and are happy they can pay to get in. Also on the playstations store site it even says you get instant early access on the 18th. you probably just didnt read that far. ||||| I mean at least don't have the game pretend theres something wrong with your purchase and that you still need to buy a founders pack. Or just don't sell dlc content before a free to play game even goes into early access.

6202	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	So during PTJOU, Mark Rosewater spoke about Khans of Tarkir and how there is going to be something that we've been asking for for a long time that they're finally doing. A lot of speculation has been around fetch land reprints, but Mark hasn't had the best track record recently with hyping-up things... (If you are unaware, he spoke about a Future Shifted card in Theros, and it was Nessian Courser) What I'm wondering is what could possibly be in Khans that we've been asking for? Also, if they arn't fetches, how much backlash do you think there would be?  TL;DR- If its not the fetches in Khans, what else could it be and how badly is MaRo gonna get backlash for it? ||||| If you put Maro's Storm Scale from oldest to newest, most likely "asking for forever" is Dwarves. Dwarf Tribal. Second most likely is cycling.  Artifacts, dragons, gold tokens: Dwarves! ||||| My speculation is, and has been, full-art lands. ||||| Wedge colors factions? People been asking for it for quite some time I think. ||||| Riggers and contraptions ||||| I'm going for fortifications. Not sure why, exactly.  ||||| It's the community that over hypes things and makes ridiculous claims. "Hey look at this art" into "Huh that color scheme is kinda red-white-black" into "I wonder if it's art for a wedge colored card" into "I suppose this could be a wedge themed block" into "Hey guys so how super hyped are you all for what's basically confirmed to be a wedge block?"  Maro gets tons of requests for all kinds of things, and most of the weird stuff he gets asked for is stuff that fans have been nagging him about for way longer than fetchlands have needed a reprint. If anybody reads too much into that statement from Maro and actually expects something that they personally have wanted, then they're just setting themselves up for disappointment. ||||| Third un-set ||||| I don't necessarily think he'll get any backlash at all if there aren't fetches. Mark has a very finite way of slithering his way around questions when he knows he can't just out right tell us, but yet, every time his answers are *technically* correct. I have no idea what it will be that we get that we're asking for, but if it isn't fetches Mark will not receive backlash for it.

Obviously what better kind of land to fortify than full art lands to cover the thing that people have been asking for that they have done.

2278	1,3,3,3,3,1,0	16	I've been playing warframe for almost a year now (currently MR10) and one thing that I think will greatly improve teamwork and synergy between warframes would be to allow for players to aggro and draw fire from surrounding enemies. This will help certain warframe such as Rhino and Zephyr tank more effectively and help weaker allies and less experienced players from being killed far too quickly.  Furthermore, it should be possible to increase your threat rating through warframe mods, weapon mods, auras, and/or cosmetics so players have the option to customise any warframe, weapon or archwing combination to draw more fire to themselves.  You may argue that "Warframe is not WOW" but this would give most of the warframes the potential to be more effective at what they do best, for example Vauban would be able to trap a greater number of enemies in more situations that simply spamming the life pod/terminals in defence missions, whilst Rhino, Mesa, Trinity, Zephyr, Valkyr and Frost could actually serve more effective tanking roles, helping the team to stay alive.  Lastly, this change could help to make Warframe more challenging for veteran players as they can play under the threat of being killed far more easily whilst allowing for greater crowd control synergy and more variety in loadouts, essentially becoming a short-term handicap that can turn into a massive advantage for a co-ordinated team.  ||||| There is actually something in the code that has been datamined involving taunts and the focus system.  We will know more in the future. ||||| Well we kinda have that in the form of Loki, Saryn and Mirage. Both Lokis decoy and Saryns molt draw aggro and Mirages clones sort of do (for her anyways). Instead of having mods to draw aggro, people just need to stick together so they don't get swarmed on the other side of the map.  ||||| There is already an aggro system. Very minor, but it exists.  Search aggro on the wikia (or go [here]([URL] and you'll see examples of aggro-drawing or changing abilities. ||||| The majority of my time spend on Warframe is with a friend in my squad and in a Skype call. Almost all high tier missions that I do are done with at least one person I know and am talking with, since we have a group of 9 people. Someone is almost always on. I know that most people don't have this, but because of this group teamwork is never really an issue.   ||||| Great idea, semi in game with decoy and moot but we don't need more random utility nods that no ones gonna use it just thins out the reward tables with metaphorical garbage. ||||| "I would rather eat more bullets then sit there reviving 24/7"  -My Rhino Prime

1022	1,3,3,3,3,3	19	I bought into the whole Cesar Millan craze and tried to "out-alpha" my dog. This lead to no progress being made and even a bit of a backslide. To begin with, my dog is very social and smart but had mild behavioral problems. Mostly not fully house-broken and a mild separation anxiety. This was even after I had seen a trainer.   I didn't realize it took time and patience and I tried to use the shortcut... I feel like such a fool. I've changed my methods, based on the stuff I've read here, on the sidebar and advice from our trainer and my puppy is even happier and well adjusted.   There's still a lot of work to be done by both of us but we're finally making progress. I'd like to thank you guys and remind everyone that it takes a lot of patience and hard work but it's one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. ||||| Congrats on making progress and for putting in the time and effort to give your pooch a happier life. ||||| Don't think you were being an idiot. There are MANY cross over trainers because of experience and knowledge they've gained from said experience and other trainers. Now you'll have the opportunity for someone to learn from you.  ||||| I have friends that are dog trainers and they do great work with dogs that have difficult issues, e.g. aggression, etc. However, in my experience, getting most dogs to be happy and calm companions is almost entirely about exercise and stimulation. Most people just don't realize how much exercise and exposure to other dogs and people that young dogs in particular need. I have two huskies (1.5 and 4.5 years old) and people are amazed how calm and chill they are. Then I tell them about the 3-4 hours a day I spend with them outdoors getting them tired out. Forget dominance, focus on burning off the energy so they just sleep at home. I find mornings are the best time, a couple of hours of running and sniffing and playing and they are good until supper time. ||||| No, not an idiot.  When I first got my dog, I thought that was right as well - dominance crap.  But then I came to the light!  I am a strong advocate of positive training and will never endorse dominant theory. ||||| You're *not* an idiot. You are just a normal, trusting human being. You believed, like so many, that Cesar wouldn't have a show if he was a bad trainer.   Currently in the USA, *anyone can say they are a trainer and they can use any methods they want*. They are not nearly as liable as any other teaching based career! You, like so many well intended people, are why we need a government standard that says trainers *have to be educated by an approved organization and take a test, similar to the CCPDT's, to prove their competence*. I believe strongly in this because dogs aren't the only ones at risk. It is *never "just a dog" when "just a dog" sleeps with your children!* People are at risk. Other pet animals are at risk. As professionals, we must embrace science and reject nonsense. More importantly, because we are educated, we should try our very best to look out for the largely unaware public.
9019	1,3,3,3,3,3	18	Hi all,  Having just stuck a fresh pair of contacts in, I got to wondering how much I'd save buying them off the net instead of using Vision Express. Turns out, it could be quite a lot.  I currently pay £26 a month for enough two weekly contacts to wear 'em year round, I get tonnes of solution, and I think yearly checkups to ensure my eyes aren't going to fall out. However if I just got a years supply of the same contacts off the net, not including solution, it'd be £14 a month. I assume with solution the max would be £18 a month.  Worth it? Or is it really worth the extra to have someone make sure your eyes aren't going to fall out once a year? ||||| Do both - buy contacts off the net, take an eye check independently. I don't know what kind of contacts you wear, but £26 a month sounds an awful lot. IMO the direct debit schemes the likes of Vision Express like to sign you up for are an absolute rip-off.  ||||| I'd use caution.   I used daily contact for over 5 years. had check-ups every six months for the first 3 years, specsavers, and had no problems.  Went to an on-line supplier cheap, great! went for yearly check-ups at an optician, started having problems after 2 years of this.   basically I've damaged the surface of my eyeballs from over-wearing lenses  partly because i didn't keep a pair of glasses up together (they broke and i didn't replace them. my fault) now i cant wear contacts at all, and get "starring" or glare from light sources at night especially car headlights.  Go on-line to save, but FFS don't let the check-ups slide!!! and keep a pair of glasses up together. ||||| daysoft - been using for six years, no problems. Just make sure you keep up to date with your contact lens checks. ||||| Just about to ditch Vision Express' contact lens scheme.  The service and care for your eyes is fine, but this will be the 5th time (Been with them for nearly two years) where I've run out a few days before my next 3-monthly batch are due, and they didn't have any spares in.  They only get deliveries on Fridays, so I'm waiting until then - and they only send them out when you've used your '3 months'; I've tried to get them to understand that they should actually have them ready for collection THE WEEK BEFORE you're scheduled to run out of 90 days supply, but nope, the computer says no. ||||| Can't speak for contact lenses as I can't stand em' personally.  But I did save a small fortune ordering my glasses on-line, however it was only single vision stuff.   There's no reason to not do both IMHO, go to the physical location for your eye tests/checkups (as your prescription might change) buy order them online. 
9239	1,3,3,3	5	Chell has access to her portal gun and leg braces while her enemy has their standard equipment.   Round One: A small enclosed room made entirely of white walls, ceiling, and floor.

Flyers would be immune to this, as they can pull themselves out of the infinite fall before that go SPLAT.

That is a long list and I can think of a quiet a few.  I am going to go with...Captain Cold. He might be a lame villain compared to others, but power-wise he's like Mr. Frreeze on crack. He could get a shot at Chell, but that infinite fall would absolutely kill him. SPLAT.  ||||| She could take down pretty much any villain that shoots projectiles by redirecting their attacks with portals.  ||||| Chell could probably clear most Nintendo boss zones, including Zelda dungeons. The ability to fall without damage and induced-speed-jump to high locations coupled with the ability to reflect all projectiles is a staple of most games. 
7361	1,2,3,3	8	For the smallest and most frustratingly insignificant reasons. I have [misophonia]([URL] so every small sound he makes is like a thumbtack poked into my eardrum. I say small sound because sounds that sound be at a normal, audible level don't bother me. Its the small sounds, like breathing loudly, eating with your disgusting sloppy mouth open, or smashing each individual key when you type like you're a woodpecker with a keyboard, that drive me up a wall.  He's typing who knows what right now, and has an unbelievable sweet tooth. He ALWAYS eats hard candy. Anything from wonka he will fucking stockpile, its astonishing how he doesn't have diabetes. He apparently loves candy mentos, and JUGGLES them in his mouth in the loudest way possible, it sounds like a skinless horse clopping along a fleshy cobblestone road.  All of my roommates are insufferable in regards to the noise they make when eating. Even my neighbor. I hate my misophonia, and I wish more people knew about the affliction. ||||| Does wearing any kind of hearing protection help with your misophonia? ||||| Kill him ||||| I hate to break it to you, but this is definitely a "you" problem, and not a roommate problem. Typing and eating candy is completely reasonable.   You really ought to be living alone, or minimally somewhere with a separate room, preferably with concrete walls to keep that sound down.

His damage to CC to tanky ratio is too damn high. ||||| I am disgusted by his damage right now, but rito will nerf him pretty soon. I play him support and I manage to get a double kill on accident sometimes :/ ||||| Having 50-60 mr reduces it down to 15-17 % health.

6830	1,3,3,3,3	6	So in my local used market there are a bunch of speed ball markers for what i consider good deals and im thinking of trying it out. my question is I have a generic Ninja hpa tank set at I have no idea for output pressure.  I am coming from woods-ball so the whole air efficiency does not mean a whole lot to me , will the pressure from my tank kill it? or destroy the O-rings?  ||||| No they will work just fine ||||| No. If your marker required a lower output pressure, you'd be aware of it before purchasing, standard pressure output works on 95% of markers, tourney markers included ||||| there really aren't a lot of guns on the market that need low pressure anymore. There might be a handful that might recommend it, but pretty much any gun made in the past decade will be fine using a standard HPA tank at any output other than super low or super high. both of which you would know if you had. ||||| I don't think I understand the question.
9039	1,3,3,3,2	6	I have a free elective I need to take next semester and I was looking for some ideas.

They are fun and an easy A. Some of them require a DSLR camera, others don't. Email the prof before to determine if you do.  As a redditor, I think you would enjoy Dr Durrant's photography & new media. Basically you create and maintain a Tumblr account with prompts each week, then there are 3 assignments consisting of 3 YTMNDs, 3 .gif, and a 10-20 slide research PowerPoint.  ||||| I took a photoshop class and a web design class that were cool. Not terribly difficult, you'll get out what you get in. And it's nice to know how to do those things, although I've since forgotten most of it. ||||| How many hours do you need? I've taken many Spanish courses here, and it's not a blow off class, Professor Henson is very serious about teaching the language. If you're looking to pick up Spanish, then go for it, but otherwise you'll be lucky if you get a C if you don't work hard. This, of course, assuming you don't already know Spanish.   My favorite blow off so far is Sports Conditioning class. It was only 1 hour, but it was a free A and kept me on a tight workout schedule.
7499	1,3,3	5	So it has been about 2 months since we broke up and it has been a real struggle for me. I think he is already rebounding or seeing someone else and I feel really hurt. I have tried dating other people but it is still really hard for me, and I usually regret even going on the date. We were together for 2 years and he was the only person I have been with physically that I really felt a connection too. I realize we aren't together and dating other people will occur but I just feel incredible hurt thinking that he is already over me just after a month. That he has just replaced me with another girl, I guess I just thought I meant more to him then that.   Can anyone give me some advise?

7392	1,3,3,3,3,3,2	8	I had the click a bit too loud in my headphones while recording some acoustic guitar, and now that I'm unable to redo the track I've noticed the click came through quite noticeably in some of the quieter guitar parts. Does anyone have a suggestion for how I could eliminate or at least minimize the sound? ||||| Use a gate. Set it so its only loud enough to hear guitar. If you dont know what a gate is, do a youtube search. Good luck and may the tempo gods be with you ||||| Once upon a time someone asked me to go through his guitar and vocal track, pull out the scissor  tool and cut and remove just the parts with a click. This left tiny gaps in the tracks once every 128 beats per minute.  I then time stretched the end of the track before the gap, elongating it to fill the gap. Faded, dithered and added more reverb than I care to admit. And then.... Then I got paid.  That's the key part to this story.... Someone gave me money.... Not sure it's worth it in your case :p haha. But it's good practice with DAW's if you're keen. ||||| I know there is a way. I've used some fancy-ass plugins before for this sort of thing, although it was more for coughing, doors shutting, etc. during orchestral recordings. I can't for the life of me remember who made it, maybe iZotope? But whatever it was, it showed you a spectral analysis and allowed you to select the noise area and diminish it. If you find it, be prepared to dish out some $$ ||||| If you haven't already then you can purchase x-click from waves. Or try an eq sweep, notch it out then add a touch of pink or white noise just a touch.  ||||| I had this same issue, and not wanting to purchase new headphones the solution for me was to replace the click with a snare hit, even if it bled through to the recording, it sounds much more purposeful than a digital click. Just a suggestion... ||||| What software are you using?

6717	1,3,3,3,3	11	Hi there,  It's time for me to retire my old RPi B+.  It's been a great trip, but it's years old and now I think it's time to upgrade.  I've been doing a little research and came across the ODROID hardware.  It's selling point to me was the HEVC GPU support - something the RPi3 lacks currently.  It seems that the C1's are fairly well supported with OpenELEC, but I'm having trouble finding some concrete answers about the C2 and it's software compatibility.  Coming from the world of RPi, I've had life really easy - with custom distro's like RaspBMC/OSMC that are super easy to use, and work out of the box.  I'm hoping that OpenELEC is as easy (I used it once, in the early days but it's performance wasn't comparable).  I'm hoping that someone here, with ODOIRD experience can alleviate my concerns so I can go ahead and buy this beauty..  * HEVC Support?  Is it really hardware HEVC support in the GPU?  Happy with 1080p HEVC@30p, which is currently the same performance I get from the RPi1 with x264.  Can this be confirmed? * OS and Kodi support?  As said earlier, OpenELEC looks like they support the C1's - do they also support the C2's yet?  Otherwise, is there a better option?  CentOS or Debian "headless"?  I'm pretty comfortable with Linux so no issues if I have to DIY it a bit.  Just want to know the best software options, provided this will be at a TV with no kb/mouse - just a remote. * HDMI CEC support?  Currently have this with OSMC/RPi so that I can use the remote that came with the TV for everything. * HDMI audio passthrough (?) - not sure if this is right, but I'm assuming the C2 will send audio over HDMI?  Thanks guys.  Just want to make sure I am going to buy the right thing, and be aware of possible headaches prior to purchase. ||||| I also was looking into buying a c2. I know that that odroid forum is very active and you might have better luck asking there, I have a raspberry pi 3 now and it runs great but I also have a 4k tv and since the c2 can run 4k I was thinking of getting it. Here is a link to the c2 forum [URL] ||||| I recently retired my original pi B+ but went with the Pi3 because it was easier to find locally than the odroid, but I really want one! To be fair I was amazed with the Pi3 running Ubuntu Mate and the built in Wifi so I'd be tempted to buy another 3, but damn it to hell the Odroid just looks to good to pass up. I think I'd get the emmc module memory too.     ||||| For the record, I am using this build of LibreELEC by wrxtasy.  [URL] ||||| One point to note is the increased speed of folder scans on the C2 when doing a library update or initial scan. It is rapid compared to Pi2/3. Im using the wrxtasy 7.10 build on a 16gb Emmc card in my living room and have 3 other Pi's in other rooms and the speed difference is night and day. 
6325	1,0,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	19	Apparently only 7% of of CX-5's sold in the US are manuals [(souce)]([URL] Perhaps that's because we can only get them in the bottom trim. People don't buy a manual just to be frugal, especially a manual as good as the new Skyactiv.  A CX-5, Diesel, Manual, mid to top-tier options, and possibly AWD... I'd buy it tomorrow.  ||||| Yeah, we all know this isn't going to happen. ||||| Diesel, manual, and AWD in mid to top level trim? You're asking for a $40k crossover.... thats a VERY niche market.   I don't think Sony is going to want to do that. Maybe for the 6 though. ||||| >People don't buy a manual just to be frugal  Well, unfortunately that's usually the case.  The CX-5, while a great handler, from a car maker that makes sporty cars, isn't going to be making too many risks with a car they're hoping to sell a lot of.  Mazda's having money issues, due to the yen problems over the past couple years.  They really need cars, like the 6 and CX-5, that look great and perform great to sell.    They haven't forgotten about us manual users, but they can only go so far.  Would a manual CX-5 with better trim be hard to do?  No.  But it just isn't justifiable.  At the rate of manual uptake in the country, it's amazing the CX-5 is that much.  Most manuals sold are sports cars or pony cars, and hell people are asking for automatics of those, because learning a manual is "a hassle" and "archaic."    And then there's the diesel issue.  Let's face it.  Diesels are only popular in full-sized trucks.  The only brand that's had diesel success in passenger vehicles is VW.    Mazda is taking a MASSIVE leap with the CX-5 and 6 diesels.  And they are going to probably be very low volumes here.  Same with Chevy's Cruze and Ram's 1500.    That combo, while loved by us Internet car aficionados on Autoblog, Jalopnik, and here, is just not a huge seller in the real world United States.  A lot of people have obviously said the same thing as this, and it's tough.  Some of us would buy one, without a doubt.  But it's just unjustifiable for any automaker to sell that sort of thing in the US.  Otherwise, we'd have them already.   ||||| I agree wholeheartedly.   ||||| Yeah, you and five other people. Mazda is already a niche carmaker, and doesn't have the resources to offer such a niche vehicle.  ||||| As an owner of a 2012 Mazda 3 manual, I'm in. As a former owner of a 2009 Volkswagen TDI manual, I'm doubly in.  I'd also like a diesel 2014 Mazda 6 sedan with a manual, while we're at it. ||||| There needs to be more SUVS with removable top and doors other than just Jeep which have horrible reliability. ||||| While they're at it they should throw the 2.3 MZR DISI in a cx-5. I would trade in my speed the next day. ||||| Back in April, [SpeedSource]([URL] won the Grand-Am GX race at Road Atlanta with a Mazda6 SKYACTIV-D. ||||| Heck, even if it's an automatic I'd buy it yesterday. Please, for all of us that live at high altitudes give me a turbo diesel CX-5 in a decent trim level. ||||| Yeah, jumping on the not going to happen train. Your reasoning is incorrect as well, it's not because of bottom trim. The US really doesn't buy manual transmissions any more. 7% leaves 93% who buy auto.. It is what it is.
2713	1,3,3,3,3,3,2	11	I just wanted to share something I've noticed at my new job and was wondering if anyone else noticed this/had thoughts about this.  There are a few retarded people that work the mail room at my job.  Every once in a while I'll see them alone in a corner slowly reading the bible out loud to themselves.  I can bet most people passing that scene think it's a testament to god's glory.  But, there's something about it that really rubs me the wrong way.  Like someone who has been "given" a poorly functioning brain is supposed to read about the gnarly stuff in the bible and totally believe it? That's terrible.  Or is it actually a good thing to convince mentally retarded in the existence of an afterlife to feel a sense of vindication at the bad hand they've been dealt in their lives? ||||| It's foolishness.  Everyone would like a nice make believe story to feel better in difficult times, but it doesn't do anything real to help the situation . ||||| Well, it reminds me of the slaves in the early US. Wasn't it a good way to keep them quiet, and compliant, knowing they would be rewarded for their suffering in heaven? ||||| Every Sunday, churches across the US are filled with mentally retarded people. ||||| They have it difficult enough in live.       I personally do not believe in god and i cant understand how intelligent people do believe.      However i think it is .... ok .... if those people hope to live a better life some day.        ||||| Many of the children with Aspergers Syndrome and Autism do not believe in God because they are very literal. Just thought I'd mention that. ||||| What? They can't be free to choose their own beliefs because they are mentally disabled? I honestly find this post to be in extremely poor taste. 
8012	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	8	I love using my "free" subscription with my ASA membership on Contexts.  I find it more useful than any other one journal for staying abreast of the discipline, and I like that I can use articles from it to teach undergrads.  I haven't been reading Soc Images as much since I started Redditting, but I still check it at least once a week.  I particularly like when their posts get reblogged on places like Jezebel.  What do you think, Socit? ||||| Sociological Images is great! A friend sent me a link to it specifically for one post they did and I now check it on a regular basis. Anyone else have some awesome blogs/sites they check out? ||||| Soc Images is great in small doses but I find their analysis a little shallow. But Contexts is great. I also like Norton's Everyday Sociology. A wide range of topics directed towards a undergrad/general audience.  ||||| I get Contexts as part of my ASA membership and really enjoy it.   ||||| I used to read Sociological Images until I felt it was a little bit repetitive and some of their analysis were pretty biased.  ||||| YES!  ||||| I was introduced to Sociological Images by a friend I met in a demography class. She regularly showed it via projector to her undergrad 'sociology of gender' class as a discussion starter. Needless to say the conversation was fun to watch - largely conservative campus, plenty of radicals from all political persuasions, only about a third of which were Soci majors. Easily the most enjoyable part of the class.  In terms of content, I tend to agree with what's been said already. I used to read every word of the captions, but realized I can get the main ideas from the images themselves without the soapbox-like analysis.   For me, it feels a bit like when you get one of those witty page-a-day calendars that is fascinating for the month of January, but by April you realized you're behind by about six pages and it doesn't have a grip on your enthusiasm any more. It's still fun, and occasionally you get a really cool article, so you keep checking, but it doesn't have the same luster it first had.
223	1,3,3,3	9	Well does it? I'm not interested in joining any country's armed forces but i'm curious, my friend used to threaten me telling me his father could beat me up because he was tough and in the military, I met him when I was 8, he wasn't as broad as I see myself today and he still looks like he isn't. ||||| Pretty sure any grown ass man can beat an 8year old's ass ||||| MY DAD CAN BEAT UP YOUR DAD.  ||||| I think it all depends on how you look at it. The military works just like any other organisation or business, there are different people doing different jobs with their appearance and abilities usually reflecting that. So an infantry soldier would generally be stronger as they are trained harder, where as a technician spends more time in a hangar or bay working on service equipment. So in other words the military has a variety of people just the same as anywhere else.   But kids growing up watching action shows and playing with war orientated toys tend to believe that the military is the best and better than everyone. So believing their dad could beat anyone up seems pretty normal. Although not the case.  P.s dont mess with Para's. they will fuck you up!

4543	1,2,3,3,2	10	How can I find an Origin Valley biome? Seeds don't work because I have a custom modpack and I'm not quite sure which ones effect terrain generation. I just spent 30 minutes mining Biome Essence but I haven't found any Origin Valley Essence yet.    P.S. First post here. Did I do everything right? ||||| How did you "mine biome essence" exactly? I've got no idea how to get it, and would like to find Ominous. ||||| Double check config file is that biome is even active.  I don't have any good method of finding specific biome in game besides just exploring or BOP radar thing. But if you know seed and have access to whole custom modpack setup you may want to recreate that world and use a plugin to pregenerate map to certain radius (don't remember what plugin does that - better ask experienced server admin) once generated you might try to load it (map) into editor and find your biome location. ||||| I'm not sure how Biomes o' Plenty works for this, but I know with some other world gen mods (e.g. Highlands), you can scale down the biome size config option and the world just gets smaller with the biome layout the same.  That was a very confusing sentence. So, you can try this, change the biome size in the config to something really small, then create a new world with the same seed. You should then be able to fly around in creative and cover (effective) ground a lot faster. ||||| Isn't there a biome detector now in BOP?

7593	1,2,3,3,3	5	I'm going to GM for a group of beginner players on extremely short notice with hardly any prep-time, and based on past experience have found that the hardest part about playing with new people is convincing them to sit through an hour-and-a-half-long character-generating session.  Are there any resources out there (preferably for D&D 3.5) that can just give me a fairly-balanced party that are basically ready to print and play? Any help is appreciated! ||||| What's wrong with using the iconics? ||||| just go totally premade, always better for beginners ||||| When is the session? Premades or... Long winded suggestion with a break down in what to do and why.  If you have a couple hours and still want to give your players choice: Here is my suggestion:  First off, you CAN create the characters in your first session. Limit it the PHB, and go for it.  If you don't have a hard copy of the book - I would strongly recommend Pathfinder do to it's insanely good SRD found online.  Get them to write a backstory - what kind's of actions they do. 1-4 paragraphs. And fit a class to it. Crazy fireball throwing mage type? Sorccerer. Beats the crap out of people and drinks a lot? Barbarian. Picks pockets... rogue. Sings, and makes a scene? Bard.  At this point you have done 3 things without opening the books. Narrowed class selection, skill selection AND back story. Bam, Initial plot done - they walk into a tavern and end up sitting at the bar together when a bit of a brawl starts up.  As far as stats? Have a basic point buy spread done up - 1 moderate spread (think melee), 1 min maxed (think casters for this one), and 1 in between. This will render this part of the game easier.  Races - Limit the selection to 1 of 3 races (say dwarf, elf and human. Or whatever you want).  Alignment - Limit alignment to something sensible like neutral (unless they are a cleric of X god, or a paladin etc. that justifies it).  Gear - Starting gear example works just fine. Or have them go and buy it with coins they get, minus a few key items (wizards get a spell book, ink, quill as example, the fighter will have a weapon of choice, and perhaps a short bow, rogue might have a lock picking set and 5 daggers).  Starting Area - Flesh out the small town. Give it a general shop, a blacksmith, and the like.  Feats - Give them a starting feat based on the class (cleave for warriors, combat casting for casters and so on)  It will take you a bit to set up. But limits the choices they have, get's them invested into the characters, and gives you some control on what's going to happen. The initial combat is debateable - you could just not have a bar brawl at all, and let them chat and walk them into a quest in the most cliche way possible. ||||| DnD.

5538	1,3,3,3,3,3	14	A)  So like many others I'm on jailbroken 8.1 right now. One problem that I've had ever since jailbreaking is that after I install or delete a package and Cydia's done reloading, Cydia goes into [Loading] mode for 3 minutes (I timed it). Does anyone know the cause and if so, how I can fix this?  B)  If I restore and put back a backup, are Cydia's settings restored as well? That is: package settings (Show All Changes & Ignore Upgrades). While I'm at it: where can I find these Cydia settings so I can manually back it up? (I know it's not the preferences plist located in User/Library/Preferences.) Is it the User/Cydia/metadata.cb0 file?  C)  The battery problem. Even in Safe Mode, it slurped away 1% per minute, sometimes when I was loading something over 3G I even lost 5% in a (couple of) minute(s). I've read a bug in locationd in jailbroken iOS is the cause? Disabling location services didn't really help, Airplane Mode however did. Note that I was still in Safe Mode while the drain occurred. Do we have to wait for Pangu or Saurik to fix this?  D)  Cydia's AutoInstall folder is broken. Has the location – where we should create it in – been changed or something similar? Or do we have to wait for Saurik to fix it?  E)  Another problem I have is being stuck in safe mode. Due to being too lazy to install almost 250 packages one by one, have Cydia lag 3 minutes every time and then respring or reboot… I've put back everything at once with PkgBackup and started deleting uncompatibles while also ticking the 'Show all changes' setting so at least I get a heads up when updates arrive. Result: still in Safe Mode, not all packages I installed are in [the]([URL] [three]([URL] [lists]([URL] I checked. Note: don't trust these lists to be completely correct. **Tl;dr:** Could anyone be bothered to point out packages you've found to be incompatible with iOS 8? Or otherwise help out? :)  I've made a little progress after deleting 58 packages. It doesn't directly go to Safe Mode anymore: my Winterboard's springlogo shows first, then it enters Safe Mode.  I'll post my packages list in the comments.  Thanks a bunch!  ^^If ^^you ^^read ^^all ^^of ^^this ^^I ^^love ^^you ^^nevertheless ||||| A) For people who have long loading time.. Please change your language back to English or anything to English. Including time.  I suspected Cydia localization is still not yet complete and need to be refined. This cause cydia to search for that localization however is incomplete, and this is where it takes time. ||||| I wasn't sure whether I was going to filter out the 'expert' packages, but I figured I'd just leave them. Thanks! :)  */Edit: removed long list of packages./* ||||| A) I don't have a solution, but I, too, have noticed a very prolonged "Loading..." screen after installing a package compared to iOS 7. Hopefully Saurik fixes this soon, as I presume this is a Cydia-wide issue.  C) Pangu was updated to fix the locationd issue, I think 0.4? Too lazy to check for sure, but the latest update definitely has the fix for that. If you are already updated it might just be the immense amount of tweaks you already have installed! My best guess is that some tweaks are not quite optimized fully for iOS 8 and might have some battery-draining issues, it's almost impossible to find the culprit with the amount of tweaks you have installed, best bet would probably just to wait for more updates for your tweaks. ||||| >A) So like many others I'm on jailbroken 8.1 right now.

Tl;dr: Could anyone be bothered to point out packages you've found to be incompatible with iOS 8? Or otherwise help out? :)  don't have the time to sort through the list, sorry :( ||||| A) A three minute Loading lag is very unusual. Using your favorite way of accessing the filesystem (SSH, iFile, etc.), can you copy the contents of /tmp/cydia.log, paste it somewhere like [URL] and reply with a link?  B) I'm not sure; saurik would have to answer this.  C) Safe Mode itself could potentially have an issue causing the battery drain. Does the battery drain happen when you reboot with Substrate disabled (by holding the volume up button while booting)?  D) What do you mean by the AutoInstall folder being broken? It's been working fine for other people.  E) Installing 250 old packages at once is going to cause problems. I would really recommend uninstalling Cydia Substrate, which will also uninstall all your tweaks, and then reinstall only the ones that the developers themselves have noted are compatible. If your device seems fine at that point, then it's reasonable to start experimenting and adding more packages.
