8352	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	12	As a developer that has been using Symfony for the past few months, I'm curious about how others are using it.  What sorts of (cool) things are you doing with Symfony?  What framework(s) were you using previously?  How was the transition? ||||| Nothing "cool" really on my end. I use the framework for pretty much all my clients' websites, for the scalability and ease it gives me, for small and even massive sites I've built. I've also made a pretty impressive CMS bundle which I use on my clients' websites as well.  Other than that, a few personal projects and I always make use of Symfony Components in them because of how decoupled they are and well documented (things like a media scraper library, invoice manager, website status monitoring, homebrew manager, etc).  Symfony is truly an amazing framework, you can put together some amazing stuff. It may be a PITA sometimes with configuration but end result is worth it. ||||| I'm using it to build an adventure travel site for a client. Almost all of the data is coming from a SOAP server, so I wrote a caching layer which can be configured per-method if need be. I'm only using Doctrine for user accounts, the blog, and photo galleries.  The project was originally meant to use Drupal, but I managed to convince the higher-ups that Symfony would probably be a better choice. I can't imagine what kind of hell I'd be in if I actually used Drupal. ||||| I have implemented it on a couple of clients sites, one an awards nomination and review system and another a grant reporting system. I'm soon going to be implementing it on an application to send questionnaires to candidates and get their responses. It will feature an API. The other app in development is a Tell-A-Friend application with user-defined styles and reporting. ||||| My team's one and only project is building and maintaining an enormous ERP system for a company that manufactures and installs oil and gas facilities.  It handles pretty much all aspects of the company's operation at this point; employee records, time tracking, inventory, quoting, standards compliance, *everything*.  We started out with symfony 1.4 back about two years ago (scant months before Symfony2's beta was released), and now management doesn't want to put in the time to transition to anything else.  It's kind of insane.  Everything works and is reasonably speedy though, so they don't see a need. ||||| I used Symfony to build an app for a few unilever brands. Let me tell you-- symfony is perfect for agency work, campaign modules, and multisite projects. Sonata, FOSUserBundle, and FOSRESTBundle are my best friends. ||||| Symfony2 powers my [OpenSkedge]([URL] project.
8562	1,2,2,3,3	9	Ello all, I've recently started a hosted server using Tekkit (space) and would love to have 1-3 more people who will play on it actively. I can guarantee the server will be live a minimum of 6 months and should be  24/7 with little issue.    I currently have myself and a friend and we've got some things going but wouldn't mind a few more people at all. I've got a mumble server as well for chatting. Mainly looking to make some friends for MC and hopefully other games too.    If you are interested just send a PM for info and we'll chat. ||||| Age range and server location ||||| [deleted] ||||| Thanks everyone that replied, I think we're good atm, if you'd still like to throw you name in, in case someone doesnt come through, feel free to message me.

Poor guy didn't sleep a whole lot the two weeks leading up to opening. Still a lot of fun to run. ||||| This is one of my favorite shows I've ever seen. A local theatre (OhLook in Grapevine, Texas) does it every year, and has a splash zone. You end up literally soaked in blood.

Nothing but love for that show.

4535	1,3,2,3,3,3	14	Does it make a difference if I have multiple MACs in the same network for different purposes? What I'm trying to say is: I have my main MAC but I think the crafting is slow so I was thinking about removing some Crafting CPUs and adding more Pattern Providers and build a second MAC exclusive for Crafting CPUs to speed up the process. I would expand my main MAC but I have to much stuff built in the back and it wouldn't look good to expand it down. ||||| A MAC will use the Crafting CPUs it has for itself. It is not influenced by other MACs.   If you have a Crafting Recipe A in MAC A and a Recipe B in MAC B then then R-A will be crafted with the speed of M-A and R-A with M-B.  Besides logical seperation there is no benefit in splitting MACs  **TL;DR** your idea does not work like this. ||||| Let me get it straight, I may be confusing myself.  You want 1 MAC filled with all pattern providers, and another MAC filled with Crafting CPU's?  I could be wrong, but I doubt thats possible. ||||| It is more efficient to have one larger MAC than two smaller ones. First of all, it requires less resources since you don't have to make the exterior twice. Second, say you have one MAC that has mostly Crafting CPU's and one MAC that has mostly pattern providers. You will be able to craft a few items really quickly with the first, but most of your items will craft slowly in the second. With one large MAC you can craft all your items quickly at a lesser cost. ||||| You could split the patterns and CPUs between the two, that way you can do twice as many crafts at once. ||||| Just to say because it hasn't been said, you don't needs to keep the MAC a perfect cube. It makes it easier to upgrade a little at a time, one layer on X or Y in any direction. If your five by five hole doesn't have anything below it, or if there's any room on any side just expand and add more cpus. 
963	1,3,3,3,3,3	10	I am sure this is common knowledge to some, but I JUST noticed this feature this morning (despite playing since launch and reading this sub more than I should).

1112	1,3,2,3,3	7	For a school project I believe I will need to get a true analog signal out of an arduino as the control interface it hooks up to most like can't accept PWM. I have been looking online and there have been two main suggestions of a filter setup or a D/A converter. Before I went deeper into either of these rabbit holes I wanted to check if anyone here had done this before and knew of an easy/inexpensive way of PWM->analog conversion. I need 0-5V analog for the controller. Any and all help is appreciated.  ||||| Filtering your pwm will kinda work. Gives you a pretty unstable but usable value depending on how you build it. Considering a 12bit dac board can run about $5 I'd go that route instead. Sure you have to deal with using I2C which adds another interface to your project, but the libraries for that already exist. Easier route IMO. ||||| What resolution do you need on that 0-5V signal? You could get away with an R2R in a pinch. A DAC would probably be easier though and give you great resolution. ||||| I use the mcp4901 on one of my projects. 8-12 bit DAC, real easy to use. ||||| Simplest method is making an Low-Pass RC Filter with a time constant greater than the period of the PWM signal. It's not going to be perfect but if you have a big enough time constant your signal is going to be fairly DC. Depends how precise you want it, if you want it to be like 100% DC with no fluctuations you can't really get that with a filter, but if you just want it to be fairly flat a filter can do that.  You just have to make sure your resistor isn't too high of a value because you'll get voltage loss, but you also can't have your capacitance too high because you get weird capacitor responses when its gets high.
3627	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	I went to school for three years and accumulated about 25k of debt...I dropped out. After that I went backpacking all over Europe. I just got back to the states and started a job. I want to go back to school and finish what I started. It's been 5 years since I left and don't have any money to pay for school, my credit score is dirt.  How do I climb out of this massive hole?  Edit: thanks to the help of this site I set up a monthly installment plan and in 6 months I will be eligible for financial assistance and thus resume and FINISH my education. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction.  All you have to do is make a call to your creditors...they don't bite and you will feel so much better afterwards ||||| Are the Federal/DoE loans?  Call them, they're really reasonable and should be able to help you set up a repayment plan. ||||| [After the borrower has made 6 consecutive, voluntary, on-time, full monthly payments on a defaulted loan, the borrower regains eligibility for federal student aid.

I'd suggest someone like DMCC ([URL]  No matter what you do (1) address it now, before your loan holders take legal action, because they will.

8450	1,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2	14	[empty] ||||| I read about this on Slashdot and they linked to another good article [here]([URL]  Basically, we can expect to see Windows and Microsoft Office usage via these subscription services sold to us in blocks of usage. In this example, 10 hours of usage runs out to about $5. It's going to depend on some clever marketing for this to catch on.  I don't think this is an entirely good move - I'd rather be granted access on all my devices for purchasing the desktop application. ||||| I don't really see this taking off.  I have a pc and an iPad and never once thought man I wish I had windows on my iPad ||||| MS Office isn't even free on Windows.  ||||| why would it be free?  ||||| He who can and is willing to afford an Ipad should be able to pay anyways.   Fucking richfags -_- ||||| As someone who isn't the least bit interested in anything to do with apple, I still think this is a fruitless endeavor. The fan boys won't be happy unless they get MS office for free or at a normal app price. A 10 hour rate I think is pretty dumb, won't make much revenue and it probably cost more to develop the app then they will get in return. I would have recommended that MS build a full MS office for iPad and release that after they launch Windows 8. Launch W8 as a business tablet running legacy apps and it will be more appealing to businesses thus they invest in them, the connectivity with the desktop would get them to upgrade their OS, then when enough have switched to win 8 then release the iPad version of MS office, there should be a strong competition between W8 and IOS where android is the bottom player. Apple fan boys will rage at MS for withholding and what not but they'd do that regardless. ||||| It's funny how fanboys have always bashed MS for running Windows on their tablets but now even iPad users want to get in on some action and when MS is trying to get some moeny out of it, iPad users are bashing MS again. The question is... why do they want to use Windows on iPad in the first place, after all these years of bashing.

8518	1,3,3	5	Hi guys. I've got an external hard disk, and it has been giving me a difficult time. I believe the warranty has expired and so I sadly cannot return it. Let's see if any of these symptoms are familiar to you:  A. The hard disk will not be detected if it is not first plugged into a USB2.0-compatible hub, which is itself plugged into a USB2.0-capable port. Plugging it *directly* into USB1.1 ports is hit or miss.  B.  It can disconnect at random times, while absolutely idle. It must be replugged to be detected.  C. Most importantly, it drops out when transferring files. There is some information associated with this, but I'm not sure how to make use of it all:  * Disconnected while in Ubuntu: A 'bread block' error is given for a number of blocks (seen from dmesg | tail or the systemlog) * Disconnected while in XP: Teracopy tells me that the 'semaphore period has expired' for the file (this occurs after a long waiting period). It will then attempt to continue copying other files I may have selected, but will fail as well with the same error. * The same file will always stop copying at the same particular point. Zipping the file does not help, as the hard drive will still fail to copy the file over for some reason. * After failure, the hard drive must be replugged to be detected again. * The WD Diagnostic Tool notes that the drive, at worst, had a terrible amount of seek errors (value 253 to the usual 100).  **Relevant Information:** * Laptop: Asus A9RP * OS: Windows XP SP 3 dualboot w/ Ubuntu 10.10 * Ext. Hard Drive: Western Digital 1TB Elements Desktop (FAT32) ||||| The USB issues sound suspicious.  I would first try plugging it into a different port in the hub and the hub into a different port on the laptop, if you haven't tried that already.  Next I would probably try replacing the cable and/or trying it in a different computer. ||||| Make sure you have both the usb cable and the power cable installed. If no power cable then you should have a special USB cable that has two plugs to provide extra power.  A regular USB cable works on some motherboards, won't on some, and sort of works but beeps or disconnects on others. It really sounds like the external drive isn't getting enough power those issues sound like the issues I get from my drive when I use the wrong cable.
3939	1,3,3,3,1,1	13	I dunno about the rest of you, but I've already heard about a few problems with this new set, as well as seen a couple of my own.  First, I was hearing that the numbered cards were somewhat off.  And that some cards had the wrong-colored rarity stripe.  Then tonight I opened my starter set and immediately noticed a typo on Darkseid "God of Apokolips" card (it says "... Justice League **affiliationt**")  Then I opened my *very first* booster pack, got Cyborg "**Expectionally** Gifted".  I checked it against the checklist that came with the set, and his card says "Exceptionally Gifted," so I know it's a typo.  Maybe I'm just too much of a grammar/spelling nazi but these mistakes just irritate me.  Is WizKids developing these sets so stupidly fast that they have no time for quality control or something?  Maybe I should lower my standards, but this is pretty disappointing, honestly. ||||| At this point, I'm upset every single set seems to have some form of error and won't expect much from Wizkids anymore. Don't even get me started on the art work for the yugioh cards, literally looks like they took a picture off of their TV screens while watching the show. ||||| They're a small company, so I'm sure they're not paying someone enough to proof read, or if they are, it's not their main job. Combine that with trying to ship sets as fast as possible, and you get errors like these.  At least the dice/card quality is pretty good for this set. Only had 1 pack out of 90 where the cards were stuck together, and just one character's die is terrible(Captain Cold). ||||| Trust me guys, they've been getting better. There is a long list of characters with poor and inconsistent  wording (both grammatically and mechanically), and a few spelling mistakes.  Hopefully as the game continues they'll eventually get to a good professional quality in ALL aspects of execution. They've majorly stepped up dice quality since the first set, which I am most happy about. :D ||||| I just opened Black Canary - "Crime Fighter" and it is marked with a green stripe for an uncommon with #77 of 138.  The expansion pack checklist that came with my starter has her listed under common and numbered as #39. Which is misprinted the list or the card? If it is the list, then Black Canary is the only character with a super-rare in the DC set that has an uncommon rarity type as one of their choices. Does the distribution in the pack reflect the common or uncommon expectancy rate? At least, I now know why the numbers were not lining up when I started filling in the blank spaces last week on said checklist.  ||||| And not only the typos, but how about some of the image selections as well?  The Wonder Woman choice is HORRIBLE and I'm not impressed at all with the Robin image.  Just... ugh.  
5087	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,2,3	31	I'm not sure I'm in the right sub.  If not, apologies.  I live in an apartment complex in the downtown area one of the large cities that begins with a "C" in Ohio.  While sitting in my car in my apartment complex garage waiting for my wife, I glanced left and noticed a glock gun case (the black case with gray latches the gun comes with).  I promptly got out of the car to see if there was actually a gun in it.  To my surprise, there was a G22 .40 caliber.    Now, I like to consider myself a safe gun owner.  I own several shotguns, hunting rifles, and one 9mm pistol (also a glock and the reason I recognized the case).  I have a concealed carry permit and rarely travel with my guns.  When I do travel with them, I use reasonable precaution.  Primarily, I make sure I know where they are at all times.    As I see it (you may disagree - please give me your input), I have two options: 1) I turn the gun is ASAP.  Explain where I found the gun and stress that it not be given back to its (my opinion - irresponsible) owner.  2) Keep the gun.    If I turn the gun in, it may end up back in the hands of its owner and will be at risk of misplacement again.  If I don't turn the gun in, I am probably breaking some laws.  On top  of possibly breaking laws, if the gun is reported stolen or lost and it is found in my possession, well, then, I don't think I have to explain myself.    Edit: thanks for all the input.  I turned the gun in to the police this morning.   ||||| TL;DR: Does finders keepers apply to guns? ||||| Finders Keepers DOES indeed apply to guns... (/u/VisPacemParaBellum)  just consider the situations being reversed.  If this were me, I'd return it but it has nothing to do with it being a gun.  It has everything to do with that's how my momma raised me.  However, I would not give it to a third party.  I would have them inform the owner of the firearm to call me to verify ownership.  "Glock firearm found in parking lot."  When he/she calls for the gun, "What is it?  What caliber?  What type of case, including color?  Number of magazines?" ||||| Man, you're a pretty self-righteous guy, aren't you?  What's the quandary here? Turn it in. ||||| I would not keep that gun. It may have been used in a crime and, since you don't have a receipt, you can't prove you didn't steal it.   Turn it into the cops and explain where you found it. ||||| If the gun owner files it as stolen and your carrying it, the cops run the number and find out its stolen it could bite you in the ass. ||||| If you don't return it you're a heel.   There's no moral conflict here whatsoever.   You don't know what the circumstances are for why it was on the ground and you automatically assume irresponsibility. There could be any number of reasons to forget or lose a gun that aren't irresponsible.   If you keep it, it's because you're not above thievery by opportunity. But if you do report it missing, one of two really good things might happen: you'll restore a person's ability to defend themself, or, no one will say anything and then you really will have just found a free gun.   You know what the right thing to do is, just do it. If you don't want to get the police involved, try to find the person yourself, first, and then go to the police if that doesn't work. Just do so publicly in a way that you can use to show that you were being diligent. ||||| **Assuming a law abiding citizen owned it and it wasn't a gangbanger's gun:**  If the original owner reported it stolen, you are now in possession of stolen property, whether or not you can prove you didn't steal it is another thing. One thing is for sure, it probably wouldn't bode well for keeping your gun rights if the cops find you in possession of it.  My advice, be the nice person and turn it in. You'll cover your own ass and feel a little better about yourself inside.  **Assuming it was a gangbanger's gun:**  You possibly have a gun used in crimes. No way in fuck would you find me near that thing, I would suggest turning it in. ||||| Turn that gun in ASAP, the consequences of holding on to it could be severe. I'm not up to speed on Ohio gun laws but I cant imagine this being a good life choice in any state. Don't worry about the owner, if they come to collect it from the police I'm sure there will be a bit of a talk before they are allowed to collect it. Besides chances are that said irresponsible gun owner will be able to acquire a new firearm so holding on to it really doesn't accomplish anything. ||||| No brainer:  Turn the gun in. ||||| Morally it would be better to notify the police and hope it gets returned to its owner.  ||||| Turn it in to the police. You don't know if it's stolen or was used to kill somebody. Technically, if you keep it, it will be stolen property.   ||||| Ah, Canton Ohio...   What I would do in this situation is report to the Apartment Complex that you found a black plastic case with the exact location of where it was without telling them the contents of the case or what it actually was.  With any luck the owner has already contacted the complex office asking if anyone has reported or turned in something and can get you two in touch.  Shit happens, and there is a possibility this was legitimately 'misplaced' (fell out of gun bag or something like that) and I'm quit sure the owner would be very grateful to have it back.  Personally I'd buy you several large steak dinners and a shit ton of beer if I were in their shoes and you facilitated return of my firearm.  What I would NOT do is turn it into the police.  Even if reported there's about a 90% chance that would never be returned to the owner.  I know a lot of police (in and out of Ohio) that would do one of two things;  Take zero action and the gun would sit around the PD until they destroyed seized firearms or would "misplace" it into their personal collection.  That's just me. ||||| This is such a troll post. ||||| You are required to notify the police if you lose or have your gun stolen in Ohio.  Do with that what you will.     ||||| >1) I turn the gun is ASAP. Explain where I found the gun and stress that it not be given back to its (my opinion - irresponsible) owner.  You sure are making a lot of assumptions here... ||||| Why would you willingly want to own a gun that is very likely been reported as being stolen? ||||| Turn it in!  You can't be the daddy to this idiot, the cops will lecture him about it!  You really can't keep this gun without having a risk of being thrown in jail   Best case scenario, you're using what is in legal terms a "stolen gun" because the owner would not be happy (nor would law enforcement) if it came to light that you had a gun registered to somebody else.
7273	1,3,3	4	until I stumbled across this subreddit, I had no clue that I had a problem with porn or fapping. I am 24/m in good shape and 3 years involved with my fiance. for about a year now I have had problems getting a good erection to have sex with my fiance (at best I am usually only 3/4 massed during intercourse). during this last year I have thought that I may possibly have a medical issue with my junk considering I am a smoker and all. I also had been thinking that maybe my soon to be wife was to blame, because she isn't a very sexual person. our sex life is pretty boring. no bjs and usually just missionary. I have sex probably 2-3 times per week times a week and jerk off probably 5-7 times weekly. but until I stumbled across this subreddit I had no clue you could be addicted to porn but I realize that is likely what is happening to me right? I mean I sometimes watch some pretty hardcore stuff. don't really feel its necessary to get into that but it started when I was about 13 when my best friend at that time showed me a pic of a girl sucking a cock on his folks computer. ever since then I have been jerking off and watching crazier and crazier shit as the years have passed. so is this what's happening to me in bed with my girl? do I have unrealistic expectations? I never have thought about quitting porn or jerking off and honestly now that I am thinking about it I dunno if I could because its so routine in my life. my fiance doesn't know I jerk off as much as I do because she is usually asleep or im in the shower or pretending to shit when I pull it. if I just quit watching porn and jerking off, will that suffice for a "reboot" or am I supposed to abstain from sex as well? because im not sure what I would tell my fiance if thats the case.  ||||| If you have ED issues, you'll likely need a full reboot, i.e. abstaining from sex as well. ||||| I was/am in your shoes.  My long time S/O stumbled across my addiction and how bad it actually was and I almost lost her... twice. It is definitely best to come clean and get her help in the matter. My girl is VERY understanding as she has since researched the hell out of all this and keeps me accountable. I come from a religious upbringing (read my [first]([URL] [two]([URL] posts) and we were taught never to talk about any of this stuff and to hide it all. It's been very hard to be open, but it has brought us closer and I have found that my girl is more into sex than I gave her credit for. It was actually me not wanting it because I had recently taken care of myself, or that I thought it would be easier or better if I just wait til she's gone and I can get real nasty on my own. It hasn't even been that long, but I've gone from 3/4 mast to over full and able to keep it that way for an *extended* amount of time. She has been loving it and I have been loving being able to give it to her.   Try it out. What have you got to lose?
7940	1,3,3	13	Can anyone explain why? Is it because the way the game is programmed? ||||| Some Smash 4 tournaments even use 2. It has to do with game length.  In For Glory, a 2-stock match is timed at 5 minutes. Many TOs have used that as a benchmark to know that a given match (best of 3) will last ~15 minutes.  There have been several that use 3-stocks as well because that's what Brawl used for the most part. The game is still young, so the scene still hasn't decided on which to use.   TL;DR: Matches would take too long at 4-stock because the game is slower than Melee and PM. ||||| It's because melee and PM are fast/aggressive fighting games where stocks can be taken in a single combo. This means that even games with 4 stocks can sometimes end in 2-4 minutes.   Smash 4 is really campy, slow, and floaty. Every stock takes a long time to finish since there are no combos. The tournaments would last way too long with 4 stocks. 
3138	1,3,3,3	5	I have 2 week old twins who spent over a week in the NICU. I started pumping the second day after delivery (I had a c section and was quite out of it for a while). They were born at 35.4 weeks, and had trouble eating from a bottle, and even had trouble digesting food from their feeding tubes for most of their NICU stay. I put them to the breast whenever they show they want to try. They're slowly getting better at breastfeeding with the help of a nipple shield. My newest problem is unstable supply! I'm pumping 6 times a day, right after the babies eat their formula/breast milk combo from bottles. As of yesterday I was producing 1 oz per breast, per pumping. Today its dropped to half. Every day I drink 3 cups of mother's milk tea, and I try to pump right after I shower, or when I put a baby to bed after they fall asleep on my chest. I missed one pumping yesterday because I wasn't at home and forgot a pump part (doh!). I need help! Can I use fenugreek with the tea, or is that too much? What about domperidone, I've read a lot of women's opinions on it, would I use it alone, or with fenugreek, or tea? How can I, or when should I put the babies to breast more often without them or myself, getting too frustrated? I'm not giving up this easy, I'm just getting tired of feeling like I'm failing my babies.  ||||| You're not failing your babies.  Getting started is the most difficult part... and not only do you have double the baby work, but your babies are not yet even 40 weeks gestation old.   Try to find some in person breastfeeding support/help ASAP.  Getting them on the breast will make things easier.  Look for an IBCLC or LLL in your area.  If you need help finding them, I can provide links.  Pumping 6 times a day simply isn't enough to make a full supply.  8 times a day is the minimum.  Doing it at the same times each day will result in better output.  You also need at least one pumping or nursing session between the hours of 2am and 6am when prolactin levels are at their peak.  Adding fenugreek/domperidone.... (especially domperidone) may actually make things worse if your breasts are not getting enough physical stimulation.  You don't want to come down with mastitis because the milk isn't being effectively removed often enough.  I'd start with more pumping.  Follow each 15-minute pumping session with 5 minutes of hand expression.    Try to put the babies to breast when they're not super hungry.  They'll be more patient.  Times when you are relaxed are also good - like when you're in the bath.  I loved nursing my baby in the bath.  I'd set him in his car seat or bouncy seat or something like that on the bathroom floor.  Then when I was ready for him, I'd reach and get him to join me in the tub.  Then I'd get out the same way - first I'd get him secure in his seat and then I could get out and dry off.    Even out of the bath, lots of skin to skin contact is really great for your babies and for you (and your milk supply!) ||||| I m typing with one hand now but wanted to say props to you you will get there sooner than you think keep at it! dont give up!  ||||| Everyone's different, but Fenugreek works wonders for me. You need to take 2 caps 3/ day. Also, are you drinking a ton of water? That helps me as well. Good luck mama! 
4388	1,3,3,3,3,3	6	I was excited like many to hear of Rosetta's success.  Yet it quickly dropped from the news in terms of its activities and data.  What's happened so far since it reached the comet?  Edit: and by comment, I naturally meant comet. ||||| It has entered orbit of the comet, and it has released its lander, Philae, onto the surface. It will now orbit the comet as it continues on its path around the sun throughout the next year, sending information back to Earth during this time.  We have a little while to wait before actual scientific findings are carefully reviewed, reports begin percolating through the peer review process, and we start to learn what interesting results there are. ||||| It smacked into it, bounced a few times, and came to rest under a shading cliff. There it managed to transmit a few pictures, the sound of itself bouncing, started to drill into the ground under it, and then promptly ran out of power on account of being in the shade.  And now we wait for it to get closer to the sun where it might get enough light to talk to us again before it is incinerated. ||||| It didn't land where planned, and was in the shadow of a cliff causing its solar panels to not get enough light to charge. It was able to send some data back, and the scientists said it did about 80%-90% of the work that they wanted it to do before it shut down. As the comet gets closer to the sun, it may be able to charge again. I think that's a few months down the line. ||||| it lauched the philae landing robot, which landed on the comet.  Unfortunately , the lander landed in a cliff shadow, blocking it's panels from sunlight.  It stayed on for a little over a day, and was able to perform tests of the surface.  It shut down once it's batteries died, and is waiting for more sunlight.   Rosetta is still orbiting the comet. ||||| Rosetta (the orbiter) didn't land on the comet. The lander's name is Philae. Rosetta remains in orbit and continues to actively study the comet, with more info coming in daily.  The reason you haven't heard much is that that kind of data takes a lot of time to analyze. There'll be many scientific papers written off of it, at least.
4408	1,3,3	4	Going to be overseas on vacation shortly and I am worried about my cell bill.  ||||| For cell phones its two fold. Supply and demand, you don't gotta a lot options.  The second is the tech. Most cell phone calls are going through radio network and then uploaded to a satellite and then distributed accordingly. That bandwidth costs money. The American carriers have to pay for their data usage on other carriers networks. They pass that on to you. The international plans allows for better allocation of their resources rather than straight up roaming.  The international plan is still roaming however.   Internet based phone like viber and whatsapp are good. Also "burners" temp phones that are disposable if you will need to make a lot of calls.   ||||| Because the people who buy them need them and have no other choice. There are plenty of free or low cost internet based options.  Use WIFI at hotels or coffee shops, and use Skype, facetime, google hangoug, whatsapp, viber, and facebook messenger as low cost alternates.
7020	1,3,3,2	12	[deleted] ||||| Almost certainly overly complicated and expensive.  If you post all of your investment options with their expense ratios we can give you more detailed advice. ||||| Working with what you have, I'd say:  * 100% VINIX for 401(k) and covering your international index and bond index via backdoor Roth IRA.  I'd work out the overall contributions where it would fit your desired allocation (i.e. 60% domestic, 30% international, 10% bond) across your entire porfolio. ||||| What is your risk tolerance?  Do you know your desired allocation to stocks/bonds?  Do you know what percentage you want domestic/international?  Per your options that you link to below, and taking your age into account (this is a somewhat risky portfolio, I would increase the % to bonds as you get older), I would do something like this instead:  * Vanguard Institutional Index 1 - 60% * Oppenheimer Global Fund - 15% (see note below) * PIMCO Total Return Fund - 10% * T Rowe Price Real Estate Fund - 5% (optional) * The Hartford Midcap Fund - 5% (optional, see note below) * Touchstone small-cap growth fund - 5% (optional, see note below)  Unfortunately, as you've probably noticed, you only have one extremely good option.  The reason that I wouldn't suggest that at 100% is that even though you only have one good option, you still want to be somewhat diversified.  With 100% in Vanguard Institutional Index, you'd be 100% domestic large-cap stocks.  You do need other asset classes, you just have to figure out if there's anywhere else you can put them where you have better options.    If you have any other money to put in investments (maybe a backdoor Roth IRA, or a taxable account only if you max your 401k) I would suggest putting your other asset classes there-- smallcap/midcap domestic stocks in the Roth, and a large-cap, inexpensive international index fund in taxable.  You probably don't want to do any taxable investing until you get the student loans taken care of.

5122	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	12	I was packing bags of groceries into my car's backseat today instead of the trunk for whatever reason when I got an idea that I think could add some nice realism to the game. So cars obviously have a certain amount of icons that can be in the "Trunk" for storage. I was thinking, cars could have a medium initial amount of max storage. The more open seats in the car, the more the "Trunk" can hold. Say you have all your storage taken up and another person tries to get in. It could give them the message "There isn't enough space in this car." Or something like that. In the future, trucks could possibly have more initial storage, then offroaders, then police cars. Nerfs police cars, gives more reason to trucks (because as of now people can shoot from any car, so the truck is just a slower car with less seats) This also helps solo players and gives groups a disadvantage.

Except for maybe the jeep since you can reach into the back of them, but maybe only passengers in the rear could access it, it would also have less storage. The police car would have the second most storage and have the trunk be lockable.

4318	1,3,3,3,0	14	So I was discussing the whole thing about the child abuse cases in Australia with my family. They refused to listen to anything or even look at a single article on the matter (go figure). Then they said that the policy changed a few years ago,  that a letter had gone around and was read to all congregations as an announcement. Basically they said that all child  abuse incidents were to be reported to the police now immediately. Any info on this?  Anyone know what letter they're talking about? ||||| [October 1 2012 letter to all bodies of elders re: Child abuse]([URL] ||||| I don't know of any announcement to congregations.  It may have been specific to your Country or State.  Instructions on these matters are tightly held secrets, for elders eyes only.  Current rules:  [*Shepherd the Flock of God*]([URL] a.k.a. [ks10]([URL]  Here is the Letter dated 2012-10-01  TO ALL BODIES OF ELDERS Re: Child abuse  * [English]([URL]  * [Spanish]([URL]  * [French]([URL]  * [Italian]([URL]  * [Korean]([URL]     ks10  *“Shepherd the Flock of God”* —1 Peter 5:2  Chapter 12  pg 131-132  >**Child Abuse**  >^18. You should **immediately call the branch office** for direction if you learn of an accusation of child abuse, regardless of the age of the victim now or at the time of the alleged abuse, even if it occurred before the alleged perpetrator’s baptism. The branch office will then give direction based on the circumstances involved in each situation.  >> Marginal note: [See October 1, 2012, letter to all bodies of elders regarding child abuse.]([URL]  >^19. Child abuse is a crime. **Never suggest to anyone that they should not report an allegation of child abuse to the police or other authorities.** If you are asked, make it clear that whether to report the matter to the authorities or not is a personal decision for each individual to make and that there are no congregation sanctions for either decision. Elders will not criticize anyone who reports such an allegation to the authorities. If the victim wishes to make a report, it is his or her absolute right to do so. —Gal. 6:5.  >^20. When a known child molester moves to another congregation, the Congregation Service Committee should send a letter of introduction with full and complete information about his background and current situation. Any letter from the branch office concerning the child molester should not be photocopied or sent to the new congregation. However, the new congregation should be clearly informed of any restrictions imposed by the branch office. A copy of the letter of introduction should be sent to the branch office.  >^21. In a case in which a brother denies an allegation of child abuse and he has been accused by only one witness, the following direction is given if he moves to another congregation. The elders should consult the branch office before sending any information regarding the accusation to the elders in the new congregation. It would be helpful if your letter to the branch office provided a detailed summary of the matter and explained the spiritual condition and personal circumstances of the accused and the accuser. With regard to the accused, the following questions should be answered: (1) What is his interaction with children? (2) Does he admit to any activity with the accuser that could have been misinterpreted by the accuser as sexual abuse, or does he claim to have a poor memory of the accusation? (3) What is his response to why the accuser has made the allegation? (4) Has he had to be counseled for any other matters of a sexual nature, such as inappropriate conduct with adult sisters or pornography? (5) What is the level of his spirituality? (6) Do all the elders on the body believe that he can be trusted with children? The following questions should be answered with regard to the accuser: (1) What is the level of maturity of the child or youth? (2) Is he (or she) describing conduct that one his age would not normally know about? (3) Is the child or his parents known to be serious, mature? (4) Is his memory consistent, or is it intermittent, or does it involve repressed memories? (w95 11/1 pp. 25-26) (5) What is the reputation of the parents? (6) Are they spiritually and emotionally mature? After carefully considering the matter, the branch office will then give you direction as to what information about the allegation should be shared, if any, with the elders of the new congregation.  See also:  Shepherd The Flock Of God, p. 38   >20 . If the sin occurred before he was appointed as an elder or a ministerial servant, the elders will need to take into consideration the fact that he should have mentioned this possible impediment to his being qualified when elders interviewed him just prior to announcing his appointment. Moreover, the nature of the sin may reflect greatly on his qualifications to serve. **For example, the sin may involve past child abuse, and this would likely disqualify him for many years.**   Emphasis added by me  *Shepherd the Flock of God,* pg. 72  >39. If the accused denies the accusation, the investigating elders should try to arrange a meeting with him and the accuser together. (Note: If the accusation involves child sexual abuse and the victim is currently a minor, the elders should contact the branch office before arranging a meeting with the child and the alleged abuser.) If the accuser or the accused is unwilling to meet with the elders or if the accused continues to deny the accusation of a single witness and the wrongdoing is not established, the elders will leave matters in Jehovah’s hands. (Deut. 19:15-17; 1 Tim. 5:19, 24, 25; w9511/1 pp. 28-29)   The problem is that they are **NOT** told to report 100% of the time, *themselves*.  This is akin to being told of another crime, say kidnapping, and telling the victim/family "I can't stop you from reporting, but I'm not going to tell the cops unless I'm legally required to do so.  Nor am I going to tell any other parents of potential kidnapping victims. ||||| The only change I know of is the one that says they should no longer *discourage* anyone from going to the police. They don't have any such policy that demands the Elders contact police.  If a molester confesses to the Elders then if thought repentant he could just be reproved and allowed back into the congregation, they will not call the police to investigate further.  In the case of just a single child making an accusation, without a second witness the accuser may be brought in to face the accused in front of elders to describe what happened, if the molester doesn't afterwards confess then it's a child's word against an adult, it explicitly states in the book in these situations nothing is to be done, *leave the matter in Jehovah's hands.*  If there are two witnesses, then the person could be disfellowshipped, but still there is absolutely no written rule to report this abuse to the police, they just simply won't *discourage* reporting if the abused wants to seek prosecution.  The policy in place is abhorrent, atrocious, and antiquated. The policy is to keep these cases out of public light, it's not in place to protect children, it's a morally bankrupt policy. ||||| They're basically talking shit

Puking shouldn't happen too much more. It will take a few months to get to the point where you aren't completely exhausted after every class. Just keep at it! ||||| I wouldn't worry about it.  Nausea is not at all uncommon for beginners and it probably won't last.  You may very well not vomit ever again even if you *do* feel nauseated.  I myself don't actually hurl, but I know that if I go any kind of length of time without training or doing some kind of heavy cardio, I'll feel like death for the first week or so back in the gym.      ||||| Don't try to drink too much during training and eat lightly couple hours before practice. ||||| Depending on your initial fitness level, yes it can be normal.  The way to avoid it?  Don't give up.  Simple as that. ||||| People at the gym will try and push you past your limits.  Consider this like drinking alcohol.  Only you know when you've had too much.  Don't let your friends push you past the point. This is common, but not healthy.  ||||| Sounds like you're gassing out.  Everytime you strike, breath out.   ||||| [deleted]
168	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	11	What are your favourite coral, peach, or orange lipsticks? I'm looking to add some new colours to my lip colour stash! ||||| Don't have a recommendation but let me just deter you from the apieu smudge tint sticks. It's got this absolutely lovely smudge orange color, but it's not a tint (it's a matte lipstick) and all the packaging is broken and doesn't twist down.   My favorite ab lipstick lately is the Tony moly kiss lover lipstick. I haven't tried the orange color but swatches do look quite good.  ||||| Etude House I'm Blooming (esp. OR206) and My Wish Lips-Talks (esp. OR202, OR205). Aritaum Honey Melting Tint in Grapefruit Soda or Water Sliding Tint in Peach something  (It's number 8 I think) or Orange Shock. Those are my favourites that are in a stick as opposed to tint bottle with doefoot. ||||| I love coral for summer! So I actually did a lot of swatching (not really a beauty blogger, though I do review some products) and while complete orange doesn't suit me and makes it kind of hard to recommend a specific shade, I really like the colors of Espoir lipsticks! They have a lot of variety in the orange-peach-coral color range. Also, they come in a variety of finishes, from matte to semi-matte or their so-called 'luster' line. (here's a link to their official site: [URL]  For something a bit less pricey and more low-maintenance, I love the Colorglow lipsticks from Innisfree (there's a shade called 'Daisy Coral' which is just the right shade of coral-orange for me) or if you prefer matte finishes, maybe the Mamonde Creamy Tint in Matte Pop Orange would be something for you? leans more to a muted orange and I love to use that one when I want to look a bit grown-up ;) ||||| I have Innisfree Eco Flower Tint Balm in garden balsam. The colour is pretty much true to [this swatch]([URL] not like on their website. Its staying power is pretty good and it's moisturizing, not drying like some lipsticks are. If you are looking for a very vibrant orange though, that may not be it. The color is not too sheer and a pretty shade of coral, but natural-looking at the same time. ||||| If you like lip tints sum37 has a wonderful coral lip tint! The full name is Air Rising TF Lip Treatment Oil Tint (what a horrible name) but the 'orange' color is a wonderful coral. It smells delicious, is relatively easy to apply, and is non-drying! I absolutely love it.  It's a bit hard to find but KoreaDepart has it and i'm sure you can find it on ebay! ||||| I love my aritaum Water Sliding Tint in Sparkling Coral. It's a orange-red. All water sliding tints are great, super smooth and moisturizing. ||||| I like the Too Cool For School Dynoplatz lip crayon in the orange-y coral color. It's not really a lipstick obviously but it's a nice color that's not too in your face. ||||| I love my Tony Moly bunny gloss bar in neon orange, it's a great sheer coral. Certainly not a lipstick, though it is pretty pigmented.  *edited for spelling* ||||| Espior or402 [URL]  To be honest, I find western brands usually have better orange lip colors. For example, Bobbi Brown Salmon, Mac Morange and YSL has a bunch of nice colors. Mac is about $17 per tube, so it's comparable in terms of pricing to Korean lipsticks.  ||||| I love all the lipsticks! I recently got a nice coral shade from memebox,  its the I'm Lip Crayon in Linda(#CY221)

Are you trying to trip or take a more "social" dose that won't hit you too hard. 57.5ug will be very underwhelming if you're looking to trip. ||||| 60ug is very groovy in a social setting, but trip wise I've lost my head more on weed alone ||||| Yep ive had just under half a 125ug blotter before and it was strong enough, I felt stuff and even received visual. Try it cos its fucking worth it.  ||||| I think it's more of a social, I've got a 115uG tab before, I know it'll be nothing compared to that ||||| To me that dosage is similar to a light alcoholic buzz without the inevitable crash that alcohol induces.   You're not going to go the trippy headspace with that dodage  ||||| I had 50ug the other night and it was a really nice mild trip with a lot of subtle visuals. There was a very obvious lsd headspace and body high on that dose. I think it's worth it. ||||| My girlfriend did and she enjoyed it very much!

1216	1,3,3	8	Hi all,  I recently moved to Fort Collins and my 1997 Camry needs a new CV axle. Estimates from local repair shops are in the $300 range plus or minus $20. I was wondering if there is someone with the tools and know how that could do the repair for cheaper as I'm pretty poor at the moment. I can buy the parts from Autozone and help out...buy beer...food... ||||| I think I have all the tools - and a garage on my house - but I don't have time until Sunday.   Otherwise, I know the co-op (by 14 and 25) has really good prices. ||||| Just wanted to follow up on this-  I ended up going to the Coop- they quoted me about $245. Total ended up being $249 and some change. They had good service and took about a day to do the repair. They also replaced my battery terminals without notifying me (doing extra work without notifying me is a huge pet peeve of mine) but they came out $3 and it was something on my to-do list anyway.   Overall, I would recommend them. I'll certainly be back at some point.
7432	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	15	I think we've all known people from our childhood and youth who were just too damn stupid or annoying to such an extent that giving their names to our (future) kids is totally out of the question. Which names are on your "No Go" list? ||||| dweezel ||||| Twatface.  ||||| Apparently, Nebekenezer was on my ex wifes no go list.  ||||| Names that are misspelled, or made up in the name of being clever. Sorry Celleena, Nevaeh, and Abcde. ||||| There are far too many Davids and Mikes (Michaels). ||||| I know three people whose first name is James that go by their middle names. ||||| I'm pretty sure Justin became a no-go for the next 15 years ||||| I don't let those who annoyed me in the past become empowered by letting myself be so affected by their past actions that their names become an impossibility when trying to find a name for my kid. I had a bully named Steven and personally I think Steven is a dope name. How stupid would it be to feel compelled to not use that name because it was also the name of some dumb ass kid in high school?

7492	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	19	[deleted] ||||| You shouldn't let bad experiences from the past prevent you from experiencing happiness in the future.    How much do you like this girl? How happy does she make you? Would you be more miserable if you lose her?    One thing you need to realize is that "being in a relationship" means different things to different people. You need to communicate what it means to you, and ask her what it means to her. Does she want to be exclusive? Agree not to hook up with anyone else? Does she want to be able to openly call you her bf and her your gf? Does she want to spend more time together?    It sounds like you two are already acting like you're in a relationship, but you're scared of the label. Figure out what about it scares you. But keep in mind that just because the last girl got clingy doesn't mean this one will too. ||||| Seriously, my ex and I broke up for the same reasons and I didn't want to get straight into another relationship just for it to be the same, but literally a month later I found my fiance. I wanted us to be just friends with benefits, but that never works out as you expect. Turns out he is perfect for me and made me realize how naive I was with my ex. Dont ruin something that could be great just because of an ex. ||||| So...good girl, get along, has sex, girl has friends that are supportive and you...you'd rather avoid this possibly great relationship because you had one shitty experience? Tell me this is not how you live the rest of your life? You don't...avoid eating because you had food poisoning once. You don't... avoid driving because once you ran over a worm. You don't talk to your siblings because once they were mean to you.  I mean, come on.  If it doesn't seem to be working out, you can break up with her. You could've broken up with the other girl you just didn't have the wisdom to do so. If this new possible relationship turns into something that you don't want it to, then you can talk to the girl and end things.  But avoid starting altogether because you had one shitty experience?  Welcome to how life works. Shit happens, you keep going...Besides, these are the type of experiences that make you a better partner. You become acutely aware of the shit you don't want to put up with or make your partner endure...it's gold, man.  Good luck. ||||| Your ex isn't an example of a normal relationship. Unless you really suck at choosing women, it's pretty unlikely this girl will have the same issues as the last.   She'll come with her own set of problems. :) ||||| From what I've read, you don't really understand what a relationship is.  Your first gf was not a typical relationship.  Matter of fact, relationships can mean different things to different people.  For all you know, this girl just could've wanted you 2 to be exclusive and not change any of your behavior.  Also, you base current/future relationships on past ones.  What your ex gf did, has no influence on this girl or any other girls you might date. ||||| Talk to her about how you feel and what's on your mind. Be honest with her. Don't let your fears decide your fate. ||||| Here's the thing: This girl is not your Ex.  This wont play out the same way.  I think what you should do is take a moment and ask yourself this: Do you not want a relationship?  **or**  Do you not want the same kind of relationship you had with your Ex?  I think you should talk to Jackie, and ask her what she would expect out of a relationship.  Maybe it'll be no different than where you already are besides the added point of acknowledging the commitment to eachother.  She's already aware of your past experiences and hasn't (as far as I see) given you any reason to expect her to be the same.

3368	1,3,3	4	Hi /R/Cade! Recently discovered this awesome /r and I hope that I can find some answers to my ongoing quest to identify my Mame cabinet. I got this one from an old coworker, he is a kind of horder and he had this machine on his attic. He offered it to me as long as I picked it up and ofcourse get it out of the house by myself (with help of a bunch of friends of course!). Since then I have been trying to pimp her a bit and although she might not win a beauty contest, I can tell you that her personality is really sweet and gentle. Its a blast playing my oldschool games. Although I would LOVE to make it 6 buttons per player.   I am trying to identify her for a long time already but there is a slight problem with the name. It contains the word Apple and every single search end up on Apple products!!  All I know is that it has been manufactured in spain, there used to be a sticker on the glass with the word Penguin on it and the Jamma board used to play one or another topdown shooter but he was not sure which game it was.  Is there anyone out here that might know more? I just love to know a little bit of history about this cabinet :).  Here you can see some pictures of her.

4961	1,3	8	I just started playing Halo Reach. What is TU slayer? I read online about no bloom, no evade, and other stuff but none of that makes any sense to me. What makes TU slayer different from regular slayer? ||||| Title Update Slayer. It refers to when a title update was implemented to make the multiplayer experience more like that of Halo: Combat Evolved. There's no bloom(i.e your shots won't become less accurate when you shoot). No evade refers to an Armour Ability called "evade" that is associated with Elites. Evade lets you make an evasive dive in any direction. In regular slayer, you'll encounter evade and bloom will be present.
3694	1,3,3	4	This is really out of my territory as I've never tried to paint plastic before. What kind of surface did you use it on and how well did the paint adhere? Did the paint chip?

Thanks! ||||| I've used it and it worked great. I lightly sanded my surface with fine grit sandpaper then cleaned it well. I sprayed a few light coats. Nothing else was used other than the paint. It had excellent adhesion and held up perfectly fine in an outdoor setting, exposed to the elements.      ||||| yup.  Used it to paint legos when I didn't have the right colors.  It worked great.

3364	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	18	What is it about what we post that has most of the BYU subreddit completely against it?  Is it that we post too much?  Is it that we self promote? What does self-promoting entail?  Are we too controversial for the majority of readers?  Are we not funny enough? What could we do to be more funny? Is it because we constantly harass that one guy who harasses us? Is it because we post to the ex-mormon subreddit as well?  Any constructive criticism would be great. We want to reach any audience that affiliates with Mormonism in any way, and you all fall in that boat. ||||| The question is are you getting downvotes for your promotions? I mean, I've seen a few of the BunYion articles, and I haven't found the majority of them to be laugh out loud hilarious, but I don't know that I particularly have hated them. There have been a few that have been good, but its not typically my type of humor. As the other two have said, this isn't a terribly active subreddit.... for whatever its worth.   And to be fair, I like your stuff more than Singles Ward, or any of the Mormon things that try constantly to be funny, but just come off as extra cheesy... Less funny overall than Studio C, but even then... sometimes that stuff isn't my humor. And by sometimes, I mean most the time. They have their moments. Personally, I find that if comedy tries to be tame, it isn't funny. Comedy can be clean, but there's gotta be more to it than safe vanilla style jokes that just run shy of tame. Even Disney has a bit of grit to their humor. At least, those are my thoughts. You wanted opinions, here are mine. For what they're worth.  ||||| The BYU subreddit just isn't that active in the first place, that would be my guess.  ||||| I think I've only seen one post make it to my front page... My biggest guess is that it's mostly because this subreddit doesn't seem to have many active people.    I've only read 1 or 2 articles but I thought they were funny so I don't mind them here... I don't know of anywhere else that would make more sense. ||||| I'm fine with it. Honestly, anything to make this place more lively.  I'm a little sad this university with ~34,000 students only gets 1-3 new topics a week. And then there's usually only a small handful of comments in those topics. ||||| Mostly I get crushed when I learn it's satire, and not real. *sigh* ||||| I started to comment here and then several times deleted and rewrote my comment ...then deleted it.

7619	1,3,3,3,3	5	I gave up on the game after EoC, as I just wasn't feeling the nature of the new combat system. If I came back now, do you think I would enjoy it? Is the game... fun? You can try selling me on the game or simply tell me what you enjoy about it.  For reference, I enjoy solo combat and making money.  My stats: [URL] ||||| I enjoy the PvM aspect of the current time - its a lot more rewarding then just click and hope for a RnG big hit, bit more to it! But if you dont like it then feel free to go back to using the other combat functions that take less effort! There is something for you to enjoy if you give it all a chance :)  ||||| Revolution made eoc bearably in my opinion,and with your stats you could easily boss, do qbd, or destroy some frost dragons for cash. I came back at the beginning of this semester after years of not playing, I've had fun. Also with your stats you'd have no problem paying with membership with bonds, so theres that.   tl;dr - Give it a go.  ||||| They added a new combat style 'Revolution', where the game uses your abilities for you but you need to use your ultimates manually.  I last played in 2011, but when I came back a couple weeks ago, I loved it.  Combat has a lot more depth to it now and it's just as easy and afk-able as before EoC.  ||||| Worth it.

If you went public, what do you think is the biggest difference?  (Why) did you choose to work in the nonprofit field?   Will my business major help me if I want to work for a nonprofit or am I just wasting my time?

7394	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2	39	[empty] ||||| I absolutely loved it! I didnt feel underwhelmed or anything. Just happy for Daniel and his family as they finally had a little spasm of normalcy with the scene with Amanda's fritter. I also loved the second real baptism, I think Daniel had at the beach. ||||| Did Daniel just become by far the strongest suspect  for actually having committed the original murder?  ||||| A very funny episode: Daniel talking about shitty views, the doughnut thing, playing with the kid at the beach, Amantha and Teddy playing cards.  Lots of smiles.      Also a very tense episode: Everything trey, John visiting the Senator (John is pissed!!!!!).      This show in simply fantastic!  ||||| I loved this episode. After all that happened to Daniel I just wanted to watch an entire episode of him being happy and enjoying himself. This episode delivered and there was also some sweet justice for Trey.  ||||| Finally got around to watching this, and woof--easily the strongest episode of the season. This season, while still extremely good, has been light on the beauty, wonder, and tenderness that weaved through the first season and a half, trading in for increasing tension and complex darkness and weirdness (which the show still does really well). The finale seems to be making up for that, almost leaning so far in the other direction as to become maudlin. But, again, Rectify pretty much nails everything it attempts, so even the sentimentality feels pitch perfect.  God, so many tearful goodbyes. Amantha-Jon-Janet-Daniel. Tawney-Teddy (for the zillionth time). Amantha-Jon. Daniel-Tawney (that dream was so expertly done; you kind of knew it wasn't Daniel's dream and started to figure it was Tawney's but the transition was perfect). And then, finally, of course, Janet-Daniel, perhaps the strongest of them all (it would've been nice to have seen them interact more over the course of the season, instead of back-loading it all into this episode, though, no?).  You could make an argument for this as a series finale if it wasn't for a few things like the still struggling Talbot marriage and the on-going investigation being loose ends. Oh, and this was the funniest episode of the season. Instead of strange, bleak, or black humor, it was all played pretty straight, a little silly, and Daniel just giving us a charm offensive overload. Mixed with all the farewells, made for a great sweet-and-sour combination.  but lol @ Jared. Show still can't figure out what to do with him. Remember that time they tried to start a storyling with him stalking the Dean residence? ||||| I just found this show last week and binge watched the fuck out of it.   My only complaint is I'm all caught up and have to wait till who knows when for the next season. ||||| I'm trying to remember from last season... That guy did kill himself by the river, didn't he? Or was it ambiguous?  ||||| I just want to say that the music on this show has been outstanding, hoping it gets a cd release or something. ||||| The piano music that was played frequently during this episode (at the prison, in the car, and at the beach IIRC) reminded me of the music from that infamous [Dead Island trailer]([URL] ||||| I'm just amazed at the growth and change these characters go through. This episode had Phoenix Rising from the Ashes moments all through it. That's one of the things I appreciate most about this show - characters confronting hard truths - and not just finding simple resolution, but getting to see that there's a new chapter opening up for them afterwards. Like their growth is not just a finite event, but it's also leading to a new beginning. Daniel hopping off the step in victory symbolized the joy that can be found in new beginnings. ||||| Well, it is sad to see this season end. Unfortunately, I don't think this was a great season finale either - so I'm kind of doubly sad. :(  I've said this before (and it really only became a problem for me this season), but I'm not a fan of the silly humor and "Goofy Daniel". While I do think there is a need for humor, I'd prefer it to be more subtle and/or be a darker humor. The "Fritter" scene just seemed like everyone broke character to me - I felt like I was watching the actors/actresses having a "blooper" moment. Furthermore, whenever Daniel goes goofy it just seems weird and awkward. I guess my problem is that I have always viewed Daniel as a bit of a *Stranger in a Strange Land* (or a "Starman" of some sort) and while I think he does have a certain teenage naivete (emotionally), it is still awkward for me to see him being a goofball. I dunno, even though I am sometimes a goofball in real life, I prefer my dramas to be more serious and this type of humor breaks the mood in a way I don't find appealing. I understand that many others feel very differently in regards to the silly humor - so maybe this is just me being a stick-in-the-mud.   I was surprised to see Dr. Nelms come clean. I wasn't expecting that at all. I really thought he would be more shady.   A perfect night for Trey might be watching Squidbillies with Kettlecorn and a Coke! Too bad for him, he'll have neither in prison. While he is a bit of a psychopath and may even deserve to be imprisoned for something in his past, we all know George killed himself. The fact Trey might do time for a crime he didn't commit (and perhaps even get off for one he did) is somehow fitting for this show. I can't help but think this might be a commentary on how wrong the "wheels of justice" can be (even when they think they are getting it right and doing things by the book). It would be interesting if Trey ended up on death row for killing George - it also would make me wonder how many others in real life are on death row for a crime they didn't commit.  I probably just missed it in past episodes, but when did Daniel decide he was going to Nashville? I thought he was going to stay in Georgia (in the one county that would accept him). Regardless, it should be interesting to see Daniel practice his interpersonal skills in future episodes!   Honestly, I think this was the weakest season of all - but it is still a beautiful show and there were some great moments this season. I think the Teddy episode ("Thrill Ride" - 3x02) and Tawney episode ("Girl Jesus" - 3x04) were the strongest. Those particular episodes had some truly great moments which equaled the best for the entire series. ||||| The best theory I've read is that the senator was somehow connected to the death of the girl. I can see the next series focusing on this and trying to exonerate Daniel from any wrongdoing.  Based on the style of the show and the fact that he's already served 19 years, I don't think there will be a 100% happy ending for Daniel. ||||| I really enjoyed the finale but I definitely felt it was the weakest of the three (along with the season). Of course, it was still fantastic.  The one odd thing that stuck out to me is Jon telling the senator he was dirty. I can see why he would want to kick him while he was down but I can't really see what would make him dirty, at least regarding Daniel's case. I figured he overzealously involved himself in sending Daniel back to prison to protect his legacy. So even if that wasn't above board, what could Jon possibly find? I don't believe anything has been hinted at, at least. ||||| Great show. Sad that it is only six episodes this season like the first. I can't wait for next season. I binged through the first two seasons on Netflix on my vacation last month later to discover the third was about to start in a week. Good timing.   I think what happened was after the rape Daniel approached her after the assholes left.  Hannah horrified that Daniel must of witnessed it felt ashamed because in her drugged state she was willingly taking part in the gangbang halfway until the drugs wore off enough for her to remember Daniel and wanted to stop, but it was too late and it turned into rape. (I know it was all rape. The dudes knew she was high and took advantage.) Anyway still a little fucked up on shrooms and in the traumatized state expected Daniel to be angry with her, but he wasn't though he was also high, in shock, and confused in his special way not knowing what to feel. She yelled at him telling him to be angry at her and the guys.  She slaps him trying to get some emotion out of Daniel. She egg him on putting his hands on her throat giving the play by play of the rape, but in her version she was willing trying to get him angry and it worked. Daniel blackout and actually strangles her. Traumatized by what he has done blocks it out and in a fugue state picks flowers and place them on her to sort of purify her. Making her battered form look again the beautiful true Hannah he saw inside her not the town whore like their peers thought her to be.  I think Trey in some form of cosmic justice will still do time not for Hannah's rape, but for the murder he actually didn't commit. The other guys will pay when the new get out causing trouble at home and the community.  Amantha and Teddy get closer and may even kiss or have hate sex making things get weird between the step siblings.   Daniel now remembers what happened through therapy goes half way through the season contemplating suicide and he may even try it, but survives. He confesses everything to Tawney who came running when she hears he is in the hospital.  Tawney shocked, but understands telling him he didn't mean to kill her and that God (if there is one; she's not sure anymore) forgives him, and he should forgive himself.  Tawney decides to find herself by going back to school and learn psychology to better help herself with her fucked up childhood, and to also help Daniel move on with his life hopefully together.   Wow for me I have poorly written a lot about this show. I just wanted to dump after watching the finally. Til next time fellow fans. ||||| Just finished the episode... Sorry guys, I love this show, but that was underwhelming. So little actually happened. It was too much of a slow burn for my liking. Still beautiful, yes. Had great moments... But I expected more to happen. I was hoping the entire show wrapped up in this season, as it started to feel dragged out.  ||||| I had a strong feeling near the start that the twist at the end would be that Daniel actually did do. We know now that Chris, Trey and George raped (or whatever it actually was) Hannah but it doesn't seem like they killed her. Did Trey tell Daniel (even though he promised he wouldn't) that night what happened and in his high state killed her?

8416	1,3,3,2	12	Alright, so if this gets no response or downvotes that's fine. I've seen these types of threads pop up here daily about people begging for help so they can get all the doughnuts they want. So I understand if the community is tired of it.   I have a Mac, I understand the .apk is a droid pack. At someone's suggestion I changed the filename from v4.2.0 to v4_2_0 for Mac reasons.  I was also told "To install Android APK in BlueStacks on Mac OSX use this command in terminal: ~/Library/BlueStacks\ App\ Player/Runtime/uHD-Adb install path-to-your-apk". Which at first gave me nothing to go on because I was getting terminal errors until I did something (I think) like "install /downloads/nameoffile" or something similar I can't remember.

Is there another way to go about this or should I just give it a rest? ||||| I found it easy when you finish typing the word "install", hit a space, then drag the renamed apk file into the terminal. It will automatically put the path in for you.  Also, restart your Mac. Start up BS, then terminal. Make sure to have all the proper spacing in the line code too. ||||| If you're using [this]([URL] .apk make sure you change the 4\_2\_**0**.apk to 4\_2_**1**.apk  and place it in your Downloads folder!

7047	1,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,3	13	As the title says, Oculus somehow charged my paypal $599.00 for a unit I did not order. I got in touch with their customer support and they told me I had checked out "as a guest"... Anyways they said that they want me to sign for the package then get back in touch and send it back to them. Well I now I have the package (unopened) and the money will not leave my account as I had my bank put a stop payment in place (for a 31$ fee... thanks Wells Fargo >.>). Do I have to send this unit back or will there be consequences for keeping it?  EDIT: Seems like a definite 'NO', thats all I needed to know. Thanks guy! ||||| [/r/legaladvice]([URL] might give a more complete answer.  ||||| Keeping it will likely cause way more headache than it is worth. Including things like losing your ability to use paypal forever, possibly Wells Fargo ditching you as well. Etc.   It will be very easy for Occulus to show that you received a unit that you did not pay for.  If your PP account was compromised, send it back and change your password.   Keeping something you didn't pay for, is clearly wrong, hopefully you see that.  ||||| You can't keep it.  Oculus will ask Paypal do help them, then the bank, then failing that they will either send you to collections, or sue you for the money.   ||||| If you don't return it you owe them 599, and they *will* come after you for it. ||||| Do you want Them coming after you?  ||||| What's the deal? Did you preorder it a while back or something, or was your Paypal account compromised, or what?  If you truly had nothing to do with the order, you may keep it, but they're highly likely to fight you on this, because of the value of the item. ||||| So an identity thief somehow got ahold of your PayPal account, ordered a Rift, but was dumb enough to have it mailed to your address? ||||| Yeah. *Complete sarcasm* Why don't you just keep it, I'm sure they're not interested in it at all. They probably already forgot about it the second it left the warehouse and they probably just wrote it off along with your name. ||||| [URL]  I had this same thing happen with Amazon (sort of).  I ordered a tent, and an inflatable mattress.  The tent was missing a piece, and the customer service agent reshipped the mattress by mistake.  They asked I return the mattress, but after 60 days when I didn't, they billed me for the item.  I got on chat, sent them that link, and said:  "I did not authorize or consent to being shipped this item.  You cannot bill me for this, nor can you require me to return it.  I respectfully request you end your billing attempts."  They refunded the money and told me to keep or destroy the item I hadn't ordered.

Or was it a case of the manager not knowing what he was doing?  ||||| Probably Duncan Edwards since he died when he was 21. ||||| Pato 100% ||||| Michael Johnson has to be up there. And I really thought that Stephen Ireland was going to be world-class... such a great natural playmaker.  ||||| Thiago alcantara for barca and probably for Bayern as well, so many injuries, its crazy. I think rafinha is better than him. ||||| Lately, probably Adrian Lopez and Eduardo Salvio. Adrian is currently a laughing stock at Porto when at one point he was good enough to play for Spain (and was snubbed last minute before the last Euro). Salvio is probably doing well at Benfica but he was hailed to be as good as Aguero ||||| As benfica fan.. Freddy Adu will be one of them.   Maybe Mantorras too. Injuries killed his chances to go to a top club (was linked with Barcelona) ||||| I'm still wondering what happened to Arturo Lupoli.  Bendtner and him were tearing up the youth league like there was no tomorrow, and I was actually excited about a prospective attacking duo in them.  But he never was able to do anything for the senior side.  Another honorable mention is Hleb. Yes, he was a proven talent, wasn't at all young, but his potential deserved much more than he eventually achieved. ||||| Nathan Delfouneso at Villa. In the reserve and U18 leagues there weren't many players scoring more goals than him. There was a lot of talk of him being a 'new Henry'. Although O'Neill wasn't one for bringing through youngsters, he brought him on and he scored a winner against Pompey. Houllier took a liking to him but he disappointed when given the chance. Eventually he left the club on a free and hasn't exactly set the lower leagues alight  ||||| Renato Augusto was supposed to reach a status like Lucio, Emerson or Ze Roberto. He was/is incredibly talented, but was too injury-prone.   Looking at the bigger picture: I wonder what kind of impact Landon Donovan could have had, if he had succeeded at Bayer.  Not only for him by using us as a 'stepping stone' for a bigger club, but also for us having the biggest player of the US in our team. Could have drawn interest for the club from the average American fan and other things like sponsorship deals.   Heung-Min Son is showing that having a superstar of a lucrative region can have a huge off-pitch impact. ||||| Another Chelsea fan already mentioned Lukaku, so maybe Gael Kakuta or Josh McEachran? They were both supposed to be solid but haven't done much. ||||| Scott Sinclair, was expected to do a lot better than he has, Champions League quality winger. Unfortunately he fell victim to the siren call of money. ||||| Ravel Morrisson is definitely going to be up there soon the way he's going.  Other than that people who never really seemed to work out to their potential were Liam Miller (the next Roy Keane), Kleberson, Jesper Blomqvist, Karel Poborsky never achieved the heights we thought he would either and David "The Next Thierry Henry" Bellion ||||| Messi was hyped up so much that because he broke so many records, and then turned out to be amazing.  Imagine how Barcelona fans felt when Bojan started breaking all of the La Masia records.  He was supposed to be greater than Messi, but some things just are to meant to be. ||||| Taarabt probably  ||||| Souleymane Coulibaly was meant to be *so* good for us. Scored 9 goals in 4 matches in the U17s world cup, looked like he had the complete package to develop into the striker we'd been waiting years for.      He now plays in the Italian third division.

Admittedly I'm still having issues with my Krustyland Burger, but I'd done it on the first runthrough when it was glitching to hell.  I've also cleared my entire town manually.

First of all, it makes it easier to organize your city from scratch without having to fit new stuff into a city that's mostly already built.  Also, when you rebuild, you probably will leave out many of the holiday decorations that have been cluttering your city.  After my last redesign, I was left with a whole lot of leftover land.

I dont see it ||||| When you nuke, does it do krustyland as well and if not can you nuke KL without doing the town? ||||| My cool brown house has been locked ever since I cleared my town a few months ago. I may have missed how to unlock it. Anyone know what I should do? ||||| Has anyone lost major items or anything like that after nuking? I don't care if I lose some trees or fences but losing old items I can't easily get back is not OK. I just want to make sure this issue is totally fixed before I piss myself off. ||||| So far, awesome decision.

Is this a good strategy? ||||| Yes.  Also, spread the word to friends and family about bitcoin.  Everyone needs to at least know about it. ||||| Diversify.

Having said that I'll relay my experience to see if it sounds more palatable to your investing style.  Rather than invest X% monthly, I decided to leverage my investment by taking out a Discover Personal loan where the monthly payment was the amount I was willing to spend each month.  For me it was $500/month which gave me a $20,000 personal loan.  My thought being that I was willing to gamble that amount monthly in the event that my investment tanked.  I chose this path as prices were low (in May @ around $118/btc ) and I wanted my investment to take advantage of the low prices.  I correctly assumed that the price of bitcoin was going to increase.  Because of some lucky investments in Activemining, labcoin and Asicminer, I was able to pay off the loan in 2 months with 33% of my portfolio.  Now I'm completely debt free and loving watching my investment grow each day.  Long story short, had I taken your method I would only have the amount I was able to purchase each month. ||||| Honestly I'd steer clear of stocks/funds. Put some into gold/silver coins, and some into Bitcoin. I think that is the ultimate government/currency hedge. ||||| Only time will tell ||||| i suck at trading too, and I'm now doing the same thing.  just buy & hold.  can't go wrong.
4324	1,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	29	Howdy ya'll - haven't posted here in a while. Looking for life/financial advice.  The situation: My mother is currently using my tuition money as leverage for my church attendance. No church, no tuition - that's her ultimatum. My Dad may or may not go along with this.  Details:  - **Money and Time Costs of College**: $10k/semester, 4-5 hrs/day (6-7 hrs/day including driving)  - **My job** I work as a AP/ACT tutor for $18/hr - my supervisor gives me students as they come. I can expect around 10+ hours a week (it depends on how close the ACT is). I also work as a piano teacher independently, and charge $15 for a half hour lesson. Right now, I have 6 different students who I see weekly, and an adult who I see every other week. I spend about. With driving, I spend about 4 hrs/week on this side-job. I might be able to get 3-4 more students soon, however.   - **Living Circumstances**: I live at home with my parents. I'm 19. Two benefits of this: 1) I teach piano in this neighborhood, which brings me a decent amount of income. 2) I don't have to pay rent.  - I currently have 2.5k in my checkings account and 1.6k in my savings account.  - Right now, my Dad and I are going 50/50 on tuition. I am almost positive he could contribute more, and he says he will if I work hard and still can't make the 5k I need. I think he's being fair about it - I'm still not sure whether he agrees with my mother's ultimatum. I have already paid $2000 dollars of this semester's tuition.  - I plan to work a shit-ton next summer.  - **Scholarships** are a possibility - students with good grades are sometimes awarded independent scholarships here. I got a 3.93 at my 3 semesters at BYU, and have so far gotten an A and an A- in 2 summer classes here. Its too early to tell how I will do this semester. In this respect, I think I'll shoot for it, but not plan on it.  **Summary:** I spend at least 8 hrs/day on school and work, and this doesn't include homework. I'm going 50/50 with my dad on tuition, which is 10K/semester. I've got about 5k in the bank, and I'm 40% of the way through paying this semester's tuition. I have about 5-6 semesters more to go.   **Here's my predicament:**  Should I stay or should I go? I don't want to live with my parents. Realistically, going to church for an hour a week isn't that big of a deal. But being financially independent is a big deal. Making my own rules is a big deal. Living my own life is a big deal.  But loans scare me. I don't want to bust out of my current shackles only to be fitted with other ones - financial ones.  Another relevant statistic: CO School of Mines boasts an average starting median salary of $60k+. So that's a silver lining. It also makes me wonder if loans are that big of a deal, considering where I go to school.  What should I do? My parents are currently telling me that church isn't that much time out of my week. Technically, I agree. Also, I doubt the fellowship efforts will come to an abrupt halt if I move out.  Should I leave now? Or should I leave in 1-2 years?   Sorry its not a post about Joe Smith, or general conference, but I thought this subreddit would yield the most sympathetic responses. Thanks guys.   ||||| I think you should go to church and see the time spent there as an unpleasant but well-paying job.  Spend the whold time doing homework. ||||| So your Dad will give you 10k per semester if you go to church? About 17 Sundays per semester, 3 hours per Sunday. Dude that's almost $200 an hour to sit on your butt at church! ||||| That's a tough one. I don't think I have any other advice other than to do the math on the loans you would need to get sans your dad's tuition match to see the long term implications.  Just to give you an idea, I had about 35k loans when finishing grad school with a starting salary of just under 60k and the student loans payment was $305/month minimum payment - substantially higher if I want to pay it off any time soon, which I do.  And that is at less than 2% interest, much less than you are likely to get.   With a wife and 2 kiddos, that payment hurts every month. Making 60k a year doesn't go nearly as far as I thought it would when I was your age.  Life is expensive and loans suck.  Playing your cards right with your parents could get you out of this bind especially if your mom and dad aren't on the same page about the issue. You know them better than me so I don't have a lot to say about how to do that, but in my experience, most of the time being honest and firm in you convictions while being respectful and careful to avoid personal attacks will go a long way.   Good luck with whatever you decide to do!  ||||| What field are you studying?  (oh, and good to see you!!) ||||| Good degree, but in my understanding, tough to translate into immediate employment without some sort of specialization.  If you wanted to leave home, here's a scenario that I'd recommend:  * Get loans. You'll probably be in ~$100k with tuition and living expenses. * Instead of using your summers to tutor/teach piano/work retail, focus on getting an internship or contract position within your field of study. Continue building your experience and your resume. * Doing this will build your network of post-school contacts and make you look more employable compared to your peers. The more experience you have coming out of school, the bigger salary you can demand.  * Then let's say you net a job out of school making $65k/year with annual 5% wage increases. Live frugally for a while and the loan could be paid back in 3-5 years.  It's scary but doable. But so is going to church 3 hours a week. So it's all about what you can tolerate. :) ||||| I think you are smarter than most of the people on reddit so I am not sure what advice you need.   Mining in my country is a licence to print money. The truck drivers are on lawyer and doctor level salaries. The pit supervisors are all over 500K. Move downunder and go forth and multiply with the heathens with funny accents. Just do not tell anyone you were once were Mormon, they will rightfully think you are/were insane.  ||||| Don't forget to factor in grants! You may be eligible for at least the Pell Grant if you fill out a FAFSA form (which is long and tedious but oh so worth it). I didn't pay a single dollar of tuition money due to my income bracket. There might be a concern of them factoring into account your parents' income even if they are not going to be helping you pay for college. I'm not sure about this one because both mine and my parents' income satisfied whatever threshold that allows me to receive grant money for all of my tuition. One year, my Pell Grant amount was enough for tuition and books for both semesters. ||||| Engineering physics will open up some doors for sure; at BYU I was a TA in the physics lab and one of my co-workers had a degree in physics and got a job at Exxon, if industry is your thing. Another example: I'm not sure if consulting firms recruit at your new school but @ BYU they would make offers to engineering/physics students every year because to them it was more about finding a smart kid with critical thinking skills and some knowledge of how to model vs. a specific skillset like accounting or Pivot Tables in Excel that could be taught on the job. Your skillset will be very marketable.  Also, a masters in engineering management is offered at some schools, might be worth a look (I'm sure you know this but it was news to me when I discovered it for the first time).  Do the math and check your values. I liked TOUGH_LOVE_GAL's proposed scenario a lot -- it is much, much more important to spend your time acing your classes and networking with professors to get recommendations for internships, jobs, and/or graduate school. It is a better way to spend your time that will result in huge dividends.  Edit: Finally, it cannot be underestimated just how different it would be psychologically for you to live on your own. You wouldn't be fighting this battle right now -- your thoughts would be more directed at what you love and not what's holding you back, the chronic nag can become something you just get used to and when you finally get rid of it you think to yourself: "Holy crap! I can't believe how much energy I was wasting!" That is worth a financial sacrifice in my opinion. The "shackles" are not the same quality emotionally. Not even close. ||||| Stay and go to church and count the money. I wish someone would pay me to go to church.  It's really shitty your parents are doing this to you. Do they understand this only makes you hate the church more?  Get your education first even if you have to suffer going to church. Smoke weed occasionally, it helps ||||| Dude, I did the loan route because my school promised 60k+ also, I now make double that, but loan payments suck. I'm paying out $1500 a month for my loans of ~100k. Granted, I got married right after school so I wasn't able to scrimp like I needed to and there were periods where I couldn't pay because I came out of college at the wrong time.   Dude, think of how much freedom you can have at $1500 a month after your first job. That's a big screen a month! Hell, that's halfway to a Ferrari payment a month.  ||||| Debt is no good.  It's a worse task-master than anything you'll have to put up with for an hour at church and being at home.  I'd tolerate a lot of things to remain debt free.  Especially if you're planning on grad school = much more debt.  You're really young still with a lot of life ahead.  Don't get impatient and shackled down with debt if you have an alternative.  Remember, they can make you go to church...but they can't make you believe.  It's all about your attitude in your head... ||||| My advice- at some point, you will need to start living your life four YOU and nobody else.  This will never become an easier thing to deal with.  I say, you are on the right track, work as hard as you can, save all that you can, do the best you can.  However, there is something to be said for doing it all on your own (even if you end up with a little debt).  Plus, a few student loans if you keep them minimal will only help your credit.  For me, doing it on my own was worth the financial burden because of the personal gratification I felt once I had accomplished it. ||||| Normally, I would advise that you go to church, and just sleep through it or whatever. However, there are a few factors particular to your circumstance that make this option undesirable.  * Currently living with parents. Presumably this means you go to church with them. That will make sleeping/homeworking/lying about attendance difficult. * You have several years to go, and the agreement with  your parents is only informal. Who's to say they won't ramp up the terms, requiring scripture study, hold a calling, dating faithful mormons, etc?  Taking money from your parents puts you in the position of continued subordination to them. This is bad. You should be establishing your independence. See if you can get them to keep paying regardless of church attendance. Guilt trip them into this. Do whatever it takes to detach the mormony strings on this deal.  What you've said left it rather vague, but I'm *really* hoping that you are not still at BYU.
4360	1,3,3,3,3	5	If we get a drawing pin and poke it in a piece of wood, we can create a hole quite easily.  Why is it that we can't do the same with our thumb? ||||| Pressure.  Pressure is force divided by the area in which the force is applied; hence the term PSI, or pounds per square-inch. When you push with your finger, you are applying your force over a small area about the size of your fingertip.  A pin, however, allows you to apply the same amount but focused onto a much, much smaller point. This essentially amplifies the effective pressure by a massive amount.  This is why you can stab a person with a knife, but you can't stab them with your fist (unless you're Bruce Lee). ||||| Force in a smaller area.  Whether you can break the bonds holding the cells of the wood together or not depends on how much force you're exerting at that point. A pin has a much smaller surface area in contact, so there is more pressure being exerted on the wood there.   Say you exert 10N of force when you push with your thumb on the wood. Your thumb has a surface area of about 5cm^2, so you're putting a *pressure* of 2N/cm^2. The pointy end of a pin/tack on the other hand is about 25mm^2, or about 0.25cm^2. This means the same 10N force is exerting a *pressure* of 40N/cm^2.  Those numbers are made up, but illustrate the importance of surface area and pressure in understanding whether something will break.  It's also the same principle that lets people sleep on a bed of nails. Lying down on one nail would push it through your skin, but when the pressure being exerted at each point of contact is 1/10 000th, then it isn't. ||||| Since the others didn't really explain it for a 5-year old:  Same reason you don't cut your tomatoes with a piece of wood. Cutting means separating the connections between the molecules of whatever you want to cut. The stronger those connections are, the harder the material. The smaller your cutting edge, the easier it gets to cut. This is why knives are best kept sharp and glass mobile displays don't scratch that easily. ||||| Think of it like the Mohs Hardness Scale for minerals.  The wood resists scratching (removal of material) because it is harder than the finger.  The pin is harder than the wood, so the wood is scratched.  Enough scratches and you get a hole.  The finger, through friction, would eventually rub a hole.  Look at the top of a wooden cane to see that.

4576	1,2,3,3,3,3	8	I'm used to check /r/ffxiv everyday. To not find impressions /info about how the Chocobo "companion" is surprised me. Since i have a very low level legacy char, and don't want to spoil too much about the game, i don't have him, but still i'm very curious about that:    It's worth having our yellow friend damaging/tanking/healing? and most important, is it funny to have him *Wark*ing and fighting around? ||||| Aside from the very cheap cost of a green and not being able to have a minion out, is there any actual downside to having him? ||||| Summoned Choco at lvl 8 as CNJ to help with Hunting Log. I didn't get extra mobs when I pulled, and the chocobo as actually a big help in adding a little bit of extra DPS to my weak ass healer. I left him on the setting to do whatever he wants and he did a pretty good job of buffing himself and even healing himself in a hectic FATE. ||||| I got in a bad situation, called my chocobo and had him try and heal me.  He got in the way of my kiting and died.  Wasn't really a bit help.  Haven't really bothered since. ||||| My biggest issue is not being able to mount up after I'm done in an area of the map.

3045	1,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2	41	So decided I would post my results using anadrol. I am on 500 mg test cyp/week and I was doing 100 mgs of anadrol a day and I did it for a little more than 5 weeks.  So I had always thought anadrol would make me hold a shit ton of water weight and some fat. I kind of expected it to be like dbol on steroids haha.  It gave me dry results, I drank 1-1.5 gallons a day and was eating 4000-4500 calories a day. Started at 198 lbs and by the time I was at my stop point on anadrol I weighed 211 first thing in the AM.  I actually lost bodyfat and got harder while on it, I was eating really clean so that could be why. I got the typical anadrol sides (nausea first few days almost flu like, headaches, and back pumps). My strength went through the roof as well.  Current stats- 22 years old  5'6 212 lbs Approx- 12-14% bodyfat Started at 198 and approx 14-17% bf  Just posted this for general knowledge or if anyone has any questions feel free to post them or PM me  I still have 10-11 weeks left with test C may throw something in the last 6 weeks. Still deciding ||||| Did you take any AIs? And you're crazy for trying a test/drol stack at such a high bodyfat haha. Glad you're happy with the results. ||||| How were your liver values after 100mg for 5 weeks? I'd imagine pretty rough. ||||| id really like to see a before/after of this.  ||||| Just curious what brand of anadrol you used? Im a huge fan of anadrol. Been using it on and off for about 20yrs at doses from 100mg-200mg a day.  As much as I love high dose tren (1000-1500mg/wk) I have to say nothing adds strength the way anadrol does. Especially when you are on anadrol and test and/or other solid androgens.  One thing Ive noticed is far far too many people overdo it on the anti-estrogens when they take anadrol and what they dont understand is that high doses of arimidex/nolvadex/etc totally KILL the effects of anadrol! Its the same with anyone who wants to make some serious solid gains...you NEED some estrogen to make your best gains.  Example: If you followed the exact same workout and exact same diet and in one 4 month period you took 750mg test/wk and 100mg anadrol/day, and in another 4 month period you took those same drugs/dosages, but you also added 20mg nolvadex a day or .5mg arimidex a day, you would see far better gains in size and strength on the 'cycle' without the antiestrogens and not necessarily with extra fat gain.  So many guys go overkill with the Anti-Es because they keep reading the same old bullshit written by guys who have no real experience to speak of who just parrot the same old nonsense from 1992 stating "when you take anadrol, you MUST take anti -estrogens...etc".  Says who? Go ahead guys, waste your dough. And be disappointed in your results (Im not referring to the OP Gasp89 here in any way, Im just kinda briefly getting off topic for a sec because your post on your anadrol use reminded me of a recent conversation I had with a friend who said he was disappointed w/ his anadrol use. He had heard wild stories about 30lb gains, etc but when I asked him more about it, it turns out he was taking a TON of anti-Es.  Now some guys are prone to estrogen side effects, I understand that, and yes, if that's your case than you may not even want to bother with anadrol, but if you do, yes, keep anti-es around.  But most guys simply just dont have a real problem w/ estrogen on reasonable anadrol dosages. And why, please tell me, would you waste $ and kill your potential gains by taking anti-Es every day on anadrol? Because some faceless 'expert' on some fucknut forum said you should? The 17yo kid behind the keyboard who maybe used a handful of dbol tabs thrown into his Cybergenics kit before working out on his Soloflex for a whole week and claiming to know all there is to know because he found a raggedy assed copy of World Anabolic Review 1997 under his older brothers old mattress?  Fuck that!  Guys, keep a handful of anti Es around, yes, but dont take them every day of your cycle for fucks sake! IF you arent feeling estrogen related side effects you are probably doing OK. Estrogen related side effects dont just blow up out of the blue. You wont be fine one day, go to bed and suddenly wake up with a sweet pair of tits. Doesnt happen. It takes quite some time to develop gyno....easy to catch if you watch for it. You'll start feeling some tingling or soreness or itchy rawness around your nipples, usually. Or youll notice maybe some excessive bloating from water retention. IF this happens, then try taking 20mg nolvadex or .5mg-1mg arimidex for 2 to 3 days until the issue subsides. If it continues, you can then either lower the dosage of whichever androgens youre taking (example: anadrol) or continue to take the antiestrogen as needed if necessary.  The key words there being "IF necessary"!  Many of you guys can handle anadrol and high dose test or dbol or whatever just FINE without strangling your gains w/ daily anti-estrogen use!  And again, I apologize to the OP, Gasp89, for slightly threadjacking your post a bit here, but I felt w/ all the talk about anadrol it might help some people to read that there are so many bullshit myths about anadrol and it's not the big scary drug that will shrivel up your liver and leave your future grandchildren with clubbed feet.  Using anadrol for 6+mo straight at up to 200mg a day and my blood labs showed nothing worse than somewhat elevated "bad" cholesterol...which I had an issue with before I used the anadrol.  That, however is NOT an endorsement to be a moron w/ your dosages or length of use. It's simply a statement of fact based on my personal experience and blood test results.  With my luck, the next time I take a single tab of anadrol I will probably end up with a spontaneous case of Herpes Simplex 637. Yay.  But back to Gasp89, again, im curious what brand anadrol you used. My favorites were the hemogenin from Brazil. Unfortunately so many of the popular overseas online sources are selling fake anadrol like the iran hormone version, plus the underdosed and sometimes outright faked BD anadrol tabs (some contained just low dose dianabol if you were lucky, others contained nothing) Then there were many problems with the Balkan pharma tabs (as with most of his products) and for a long time it was tough to find any anadrol with legit, accurately dosed active ingredient.  A shame, too, because anadrol really is a great drug when you use it right w/ a solid diet and workout.  I wonder how well it would have worked for you had you bumped up the dosage to 150mg/day or tried 750mg/wk test.  Test and anadrol are a great mix. Add a solid amount of tren to that and it's an amazing way to make solid lean gains with huge increases in strength.   ||||| [empty] ||||| [deleted] ||||| Sounds awesome. Could we see some pics? ||||| Day1 [URL]    ||||| [URL]  Not the best but this was about week 3 on anadrol.  Ill take a current one in the AM  Started at 198.

8380	1,3,3,3	6	I'm fed up with the webdav/SCP setup we have that's bound to AD. We have ~30 or so client based AD accounts which only have access to this transfer site I setup but they use it only once or twice for moving data and that's it, then the data sits there (I've got crap from 2006 that my users swear they need  but is never touched again and is in duplicate) and I've got to come by and clean up the files & accounts.

5238	1,3,3,3,3	5	I am sorry if this is a silly question, but after reading the page from the client I didn't quite understand. From what I can gather there will be 2 separate queues, one called Standard and one called Wild. Wild will be ranked/casual as it currently is now. Standard is where I get a bit confused. Does standard let you pick a previous expac  to play in, so for example I can play GvG and only match with players who have made GvG decks (ofc including regular basic cards).  I thought this would be a bad thing, won't it split the community? Or won't it just mean people will default to a previous expac and just only play with old cards? Will the game still be balanced for Wild queue?  Sorry I am a bit worried about this update, but I don't think I am understanding it quite right :(  Can anyone help out? Thanks mates ||||| It doesn't sound like you've read the post or FAQ. Try it again.  ||||| When you build a deck, you'll mark it as either Standard or Wild deck.  Wild is every card ever made.  Standard is Basic + Classic + any set that was released either this year or last year. Every Spring the list of Standard-legal cards is changed to remove any cards that no longer fall within the "this year or last year" limits. This spring, GvG and Naxx rotate to Wild. A Standard deck can include cards from Basic, Classic, Blackrock Mountain, The Grand Tournament, League of Explorers, and any set released in 2016.  Standard and Wild have their own queues and their own rankings. Only your Standard ranking is shown on your friends list. All Blizzard official competitions will be Standard format. Wild content is removed from the store and can only be crafted, not purchased,  after rotating to Wild.   Adventures that rotate to Wild become both disenchantable and craftable.  That's more or less the nutshell.   ||||| Some people will pretend that the current mode will be renamed "Wild" mode, but that isn't true.  Here's what ACTUALLY happens: Ranked mode is being completely removed, and two brand new modes take the place.  Standard Mode will resemble current Ranked, where we always have somewhere around 700 to 800 cards. Every year, cards that are 2 years old will be cycled out as soon as the first expansion of the year comes out. That means that Goblins vs Gnomes and Naxxramas leave with the next expansion, and Blackrock Mountain, The Grand Tournament, and League Of Explorers all leave with the first expansion's release of 2017.  Wild Mode will be nothing like we've seen. It'll grow with each expansion, and cards will ALL be available. That means the power level will be MUCH higher, and if you plan on winning any games you'll need a deck built around broken combos. Eventually there will be thousands of cards in Wild mode and it will be a bit silly to expect it to be balanced in the distant future.  These new modes have some big consequences. Cards that are cycled out (at first this is Goblins vs Gnomes and Naxxramas) will no longer be available for purchase outside of using dust. You can't buy packs with these cards, or adventure wings either. That makes Wild mode MUCH more expensive than the current Ranked, another reason why the modes are nothing alike. Standard is what Blizzard will be focusing on, for example new players won't earn Wild cards from Arena rewards, and players can't even SEE Wild Mode as an option until they obtain a Wild card, which requires you go out of your way to do once the changes begin (since you can't just buy a pack of Wild cards or get them randomly). Both modes will be viable ways to play the game, but Standard will be the main mode while Wild will basically be a side mode like Casual is right now, even though you CAN earn monthly rewards and gold from plays in Wild. ||||| TL;DR   Sets get rotated out in standard. The first sets to get rotated out are Naxxramas and GvG, so when standard hits the only sets you can use to create a deck are Classic, BRM, and LoE   Next year at this time, BRM and LoE will rotate out of standard and we'll only be able to use the most recent set to build decks.

Haven't played in two days (mainly because I'm busy with school), but going back to this world scares the shit out of me! ||||| I like how not even your shelter is safe now. For instance, I was returning to my shelter on an island (not far from a larger landmass). A creeper was just outside my door, and IT BLEW UP LIKE WHOA all over the front side of my structure.  If you're considering moving to normal or even hard, do so. It is well worth the challenge and will make construction a lot more fun because of the creepers busting your project up.  I invite any creeper to challenge me. I will slay them all with my sword.  ||||| I found a item duping trick in single player the other day using item boxes... is this a well known thing? ||||| I don't use any cheats at all, but I just started a new world on peaceful mode.

You can also go to server browser and filter out the original maps to find servers which use those (maps labeled BF4 behind the map name). I personally think that if you find BF4 enjoyable, premium is worth the 50$, especially if you bought BF4 on one of the recent discounts that were going around. You get 16 more maps (4/5 DLC packs out so far) and new weapons + game modes + tons of other cosmetic stuff. ||||| Seems like your question is answered...but you should replay the final mission, you have three different choices you can make and each one unlocks a new weapon for multiplayer.  ||||| All of the DLC is completely optional. There's some good and fun maps that come built into the game and the servers have a ton of people on them still. Battlepacks are unlocked as you level up and it's not impossible to succeed or at least level up with stock setups. 
7538	1,3,3,3,3	6	I'm already losing my mind and it's the first day of the trip, actually just the travel day. It's not "abuse" per sé on this day yet, but it's driving me insane. I'm quite sure he's abusive since he's done the following in the past:  - Belittle me and call me dumb, stupid, coward, liar, ungrateful bitch, etc. all of which he says are "criticisms" so I should "accept it" and if I don't, I'm just making trouble.  - Forced me to sleep in the basement since he didn't respect me enough to let me sleep in my room  - On a trip to Japan, he flipped after I DEFENDED MY MOTHER (she wasn't on the trip). He pushed me towards the ground, kicked me, and threatened to kill me in Chinese. For the rest of the trip, he berated me and kept telling me how ashamed he was of me, how my mom was a complaining bitch, how I'd never live up to his expectations, how I caused their almost divorce, etc.  - We had an argument and I threw a basket on the ground (nothing was broken, although I shouldn't have done it) and he slammed my head towards the table and told me to get out. I did and walked 4 miles barefoot since I had nowhere to go.  - On a cruise, he kicked me in public again. Eventually, he and my mother got into an argument and he STRANGLED HER. It was on a cruise, so security was called but no charges pressed.   I've brought up his abusive tendencies to my mother, but she lives with rose-tinted glasses when it comes to him. She was very quiet while I was talking about it on the car. Afterwards, I said I was a bit cold because the AC was high and she said "Oh, does that mean I'm abusing you?" because she'd turned it up.   So far, today, I've been going mad. Three things:  - My grandma and I went to go sit (he told me to) and I sat down right after she reached her seat. I figured she was going to sit there, but she instead let my sister sit there, so I only sat a SECOND before my dad said I obviously didn't care about grandma, I don't notice anything, etc. it was simply because I thought she'd already sat, and would've gladly given up my seat for her HAD IT BEEN MORE THAN A SECOND AND ID REALIZED SHE DIDNT SIT. I had always given her the seat every time a seat was available during the day.  - I got stuck with my two little sisters in the three seat section on the plane. They didn't want to sit window, so I did. However, my dad told me to switch, to which I replied they didn't want to, and he yelled at me again. Apparently, there was a dog I didn't notice because it was covered by another row of seats. That shows how much I "don't care" and "disobey him" because I replied they didn't want to switch.  - What drove me the most insane is this incident. We finally got to the hotel, and I used to restroom and left my phone on the couch. When I got out of the restroom, I glanced (literal glance) at the couch but didn't see my phone, so my dad immediately jumped at the opportunity to say "I PUT YOUR PHONE HERE *points at location* AND YOU DIDNT SEE IT. YOU NEVER NOTICE ANYTHING, BECAUSE YOU DONT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING." with a very smug expression as if he'd caught me doing something wrong. I didn't see because id just walked out of the bathroom, and it wasn't even in my peripheral vision when I walked out.  He always says I don't care about anything, about myself, about my sisters, etc. how do I show I don't care? Basically, if I don't thank him for EVERYTHING (car rides, picking something up, handing me something), it shows I don't care. If I missed a mark on a plate when washing it, I obviously don't care. If I miss a paper when cleaning out my backpack, I obviously don't care. If I DROP SOMETHING, I don't care (I honestly don't understand this one, at all.) If I don't check the road FOR HIM while he's driving and I'm in the third row (sisters in the second) I don't care. Keep in mind, his office took my mom and I a week to clean, and he is ALWAYS on his phone while he drives and often doesn't have a single hand on the wheel for a few seconds. He says he doesn't have to be an example for me, just I have to listen to him.  This trip is already a nightmare, and it's a cruise, again. It's affecting me more, because I recently moved from New Jersey, and I was looking forward to visiting this summer only to be told I don't care enough, so I can't visit. I'm going crazy.  TL;DR My dad is abusive, and says every little thing=I don't care. How do I make it past this vacation with my happiness and sanity?  Edit: If this looks familiar, I once posted a similar post asking if my dad was abusive. ||||| You don't have a relationship problem at this point. You have a legal problem. Your dad is a violent person. He's a criminal.   You are in a cruise now? First priority is to remove yourself from this situation because it sounds unsafe. He might injure you. There's no police on board I guess .. can you talk to some adult about the problems and perhaps get your own cabin? Do you have any resources to take care of yourself?  > What drove me the most insane is this [phone] incident.  I think you should concentrate on avoiding the violence first and foremost.  ||||| >He pushed me to the ground, kicked me, and threatened to kill me in Chinese  >he slammed my head on the table and told me to get out. I did and walked 4 miles barefoot since I had nowhere to go.  Look, these two incidents are assault and physical child abuse. You are 14. I am sure CPS would absolutely love to hear about this, and I'm so so sorry you went through all that. What you need to is A) Document everything that happens and B) Head over to r/legaladvice. This is criminal law, not just relationships at this point. As for this particular cruise, yeah, talk to someone in charge. Preferably a decently friendly and concerned individual on board. ||||| Your best bet for this vacation is to just keep your head down and low key record everything.   When you get home, mention it to your teachers, they're mandatory reporters. They have to call CPS, they have to keep a record of it. When CPS gets involved, they'll likely interview you. This is where you give them your documented abuse. They'll schedule a home interview. They'll talk to everyone together, and everyone separate. It may take a couple times of reporting and handing over evidence of abuse, but keep at it. Start keeping a journal every day of what's happened.  ||||| Document this all because it will help with any legal troubles. Dates, times, photos, etc should be stored on your phone and ideally emailed to someone so you have a time stamp and a copy your father can't delete if he breaks your phone. I agree with the other posters that your first step should be to talk to a manager on board and when you get to a port see if you can sneak away to an American embassy or consulate, or at least somewhere with a phone. You could seriously die, OP. For your own sake and for your mothers sake you need to report him.
1823	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	15	[deleted] ||||| So there are three ideas I came up with that could fit the bill for this concept.  1.) A lute/[repeating crossbow]([URL] combo with a bottom feed instead of top, similar to [this one from *Van Helsing*]([URL] with the body of the lute molded to form the butt of the crossbow and the strings running along the top of the stock to the front sight.  He could hold the fore grip and strum a tune, then reach down to take the handle and fire.  2.) A Harp Bow in which the harp (one the size of a [hand harp]([URL] is affixed to the front hand grip of the bow like a shield and canted out at an angle (i.e., a slight slant to allow for one to grip the bow without brushing knuckles too hard.  You could play one-handed by bringing the bow in close, then nock and draw with a wrist-twist away.  3.) If you're willing to add some low-level magic, you could make a Harp Bow that appears like the traditional [floor harp]([URL] but it "creates" normal arrows when its played in a certain way that the Bard just so happens to know ([*abundant ammunition*]([URL] the spell I based this on, is only a first level and usable by Bards, so its nothing too crazy).  You'll have to come up with ways to upgrade it in the future that aren't OP, but, from a fantasy perspective, a harp that conjures arrows when strummed is pretty damned cool.  And you could never use it for stealth, 'cause muzik.  Edit:  You could probably use a short sword with holes along the surface to count as pipes, if you wanted, similar to a [whistling ball]([URL] but if I were DMing something like that, I think I'd need them to be a Dervish or something so that the performance aspect of whirling a sword around would match thematically. ||||| You can use anything as a weapon, at a -4 penalty do to the fact it is an improvised weapon. It will deal damage equal to a weapon of the aproximate size, and has chance at scoring a critical on a natural 20, x2.

4335	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	19	Hi ex-Mormons.  I've been asked to deconstruct Richard Bushman's Rough Stone Rolling in light of objective history that really can't be found within Mormonism.  Can you help me out here by listing any/all the problems you have with Richard Bushman's book Rough Stone Rolling?  Your help would be greatly appreciated.  I've read the book and several reviews, am just starting to compare Fawn Brodie's biography with Bushman's, as well as others (J. Brooke, M. Bowman and L. Foster).  My biggest problems with Bushman's whitewashing apologetics so far are this: Kinderhook Plates are left out of Smith's chronology Lack of detailing the controversy over the Book of Abraham Lack of details extrapolating the First Vision narratives (and ultimately what it means that Smith never claimed God & Jesus were separate beings until after 1835) Lack of explaining the translation process Missing Smith's misdemeanor conviction of 'glass-looking' in Bainbridge Missing Smith's filthy affair with Fanny Alger Missing Smith's marriage to Lucinda Harris Lack of detailing the women's and girl's thoughts about their marriages and sexual experiences with Smith Lack of correlating the mystical/magical history (thesis of Brooke's work and C. Albanese's historical placement of Mormonism within a broader context)  If you have anything else to contribute, I would greatly appreciate it! ||||| Some of [my comments here]([URL]  You may also find some comments in one of the Bushman AMAs.  You can find the links in the wiki.  ||||| I don't have RSR in front of me to refer to, but I do recall him covering the Kinderhook plates episode.  As for my criticisms, I have four:  1) He does not do justice to the influence of Masonry on Joseph Smith.  Hyrum and JS.Sr were both Masons; he grew up in a Masonic household.  Furthermore, he grew up in an era of extreme anti-Masonry during which time Masonic legends and rituals were revealed in newspapers and discussed commonly.  It is not enough to suggest that Joseph's entrance into Masonry in Nauvoo influenced him when he designed the endowment ceremony; LDS doctrine and practice had been influenced by Masonry throughout.  Early Mormons like Brigham Young believed that JS restored true Masonry as part of the restoration of all things.  2) Bushman spends a lot of time talking about the "new" doctrines and ideas, and theological/historical viewpoints about Biblical characters like Abraham and the nature of heaven that were introduced by JS, as though they were so novel and groundbreaking to theology that JS either had to be a religious genius or a prophet.  In fact he does this throughout the book and in my view is the strongest way that RSR might increase a TBM's faith.  However, I believe every single one of JS's theological "innovations" were in fact copied from other faiths, Masonry, books, or ideas fashionable during his era.  I have a copy of Rick Grunder's Mormon Parallels which identifies a lot of likely sources of JS's ideas.  3) The book is not really chronological, and its not really organized by topic (you'd expect it to be mostly chronological, with thorough focus on specific topics as they arise in the chronology).  For example, one cannot find a comprehensive section in the book on polygamy, and neither is polygamy treated chronologically; so there is not a single chapter or place in the book one can refer to in order to fully understand JS's practice of polygamy; you have to jump around the book and look in places that don't make sense.  4) He is able to subtly cover controversial topics in such a way that people don't notice them.  For example, the first time I read RSR it was lost on me that JS had multiple first vision accounts; RSR basically covers it in such a smooth apologetic way that it doesn't create the cognitive dissonance you'd expect it would.  Another example, is that one person I know that finished the book didn't realize that the Melchizidec priesthood was first mentioned and restored by Jesus to JS at the Isaac Morely Farm in Ohio, in the presence of multiple witnesses with supporting accounts, and according to JS's own personal account.  RSR mentions this, but again, Bushman is able to smooth this over in such a way I think it manages not to stand out and cause cog dis. ||||| This is the most comprehensive examination of it i've found: [URL] ||||| One of my biggest criticism is that the book is not chronological. Bushman tells Joseph's story out of order so readers often don't understand that treasure digging continued after the First Vision (contradicting JS history).   Bushman doesn't really discuss the Book of Abraham as much as I would like either.   ||||| It's been a while since I've read it. I didn't get very far, but I know I stopped reading shortly after the glowing description Bushman gave of Martin Harris. Harris was a respectable, honest businessman that everyone in town agreed about, yes. But Bushman 100% ignores the fact that those very same endorsements, every single one of them, paint Martin Harris as deluded, superstitious, fanatical, and unreliable in religious matters. Bushman also fails to mention that Martin Harris was reasonably accused of adultery and severe spousal abuse.  Gotta make sure Martin Harris looks good if you want Joseph Smith to look good. ||||| (and ultimately what it means that Smith never claimed God & Jesus were separate beings until after 1835)  When did Joseph actually state the two beings from the first vision were God and Jesus? ||||| Lack of exploration of pre 1830 connections of Rigdon and JS. ||||| The absolute **most important book** your need to compare it with is the first volume of [*The Persistence of Polygamy: Joseph Smith and the Origins of Mormon Polygamy*]([URL] If you don't include that book, you are *wasting* your time. Not only does it include crucial in-depth coverage and analysis of Joseph's polygamy that can't be found elsewhere, but more importantly it backs it up with statistical analysis of hard census data and scientific analysis of genetics so hay what it provides is so much more objective than an analysis of subjective histories.  You'd also be completely remiss if you didn't read [*Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet*]([URL] by Dan Vogel, which is available for free at that link.   In order to cover the part about masonry that Bushman irresponsibly glosses over, you need to read Buerger's [*The Mysteries of Godliness: A History of Mormon Temple Worship*]([URL]  ||||| I recommend reading [this post]([URL] on postmormon.org. ||||| Makes me not want to read it if there are many things left out.  I'll wait and read your conclusion/revision.  Do it! ||||| He is always on the verge of sharing his testimony and works really hard to distract from the damning facts about the fraud that is Joseph Smith. Bushman manipulates everything to his favor and quickly dismisses criticism.  ||||| Dan Vogel had some criticisms of rough stone rolling that I believe can be found on YouTube (if you can't find it there just do a Google search). ||||| > Missing Smith's filthy affair with Fanny Alger  Chapter 18 has a section entitled "Fanny Alger" that quotes Oliver Cowdery calling it a "dirty, nasty, filthy affair." I'm not sure what you mean by "missing" but he at least discusses Fanny Alger.
2539	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	8	I was wondering if it's possible to wirelessly connect and control certain points on an Arduino with a normal 4-channel transmitter. Possible uses are remotely changing an RGB LED strip, and anything else I can come up with. I'm pretty much stealing the idea from the door lock in The Amazing Spider-Man, where he uses a transmitter to move a servo to push a lock in the door. Is it possible to program and implement? I'm entirely new to this and basically trying to start at an intermediate level.  EDIT: Specifically the Uno for the board ||||| [URL] ->  [URL] ||||| Yes. You can hook up the rc receiver outputs to an Arduino and use pulseIn to read them. If you google Arduino rc pulsein you should find many tutorials. ||||| You're looking for servo emulation library.   I'm sure there's one out there ||||| The best way to read RC channels while allowing other code to run is to use interrupts. [This article]([URL] gives plenty of details on how to do that using the pin change interrupts on the Arduino.   That said, if you're new then pulseIn is probably your best bet as it is simpler to set up. The downside is that pulseIn blocks the entire loop from running while it waits to read the length of a pulse. ||||| Yes by reading the logic outputs from the receive decoder, or by intercepting the digital data stream coming from the transmitter.  You can also get fob transmitters and receiver boards. Likewise you can read the decoded logic output, or receive the bitstream and decode that in the Arduino software.   In either case, someone may have done that before and made a library. ||||| The Wicked Device motor shield has example code, lets you power you RC from the Arduino.  [URL] ||||| PWM signals from the RC RX is pretty easy to read with any arduino. [URL]
6290	1,3,2,3,3,3,3	7	[deleted] ||||| I'm still able to dash/roll when locked on a target... what issue are you having? I actually prefer the locking because on some heroes I can lock on the boss, then preemptively move my mouse to the side of my hero so I can dodge more easily(rather than accidentally dashing straight forward or something).  What I do get annoyed by, with movement, is trying to left click to move and shooting/slashing things. Even if you take your left click skill off the bar your hero now just sits there looking at the enemy you clicked near. Mousemove option is nice, but I don't think you can bind it to left click. ||||| Let go of the mouse button? ||||| If you hold shift while using any ability you do not move  ||||| > Any way to make it go away ?  Yeah, reclick on your actual target. ||||| Not sure if we are having the same problem. If i am in a battle and need to dash away to heal up my guy rubber bands right back to the enemy I was fighting. Does the same thing if I am trying to quickly move through a terminal, it will lock onto someone and bounce right back to them. ||||| Hold down the mouse button a bit in front of the target so it won't actually have a target. If you're using a basic on left mouse button you have to also hold shift while doing that.
5397	1,3,3,3,3,2,3	12	I've been thinking a lot lately about what is going on with the show and why it seem to be watered down. Has anyone thought that maybe he has already made his decision as to where the show is moving and that the reason it is being kept quiet is because of stock options? Maybe he is looking at helping a company launch their streaming service or moving to one that is already up and running but he doesn't want to announce it until his contract is air tight. If he announces too soon before his stock options are locked in and the stock gets a boost, like Sirius did when he announced then re-announced, his stock will not be worth what it would be if he waited until after negotiations are final. $10,000,000.00 in options would go a heck of a lot further at $5.00/share than at $8-$10.00/share. Just a thought. I know this topic has probably been beaten to death but I just can't help but to wonder and I'd like to hear what you guys think. ||||| If anything 2015 has been a throw back more than it has been watered back.  The show is currently the best it has been in the post Artie years.  The only thing the shows of today are missing are some calls from Eric complaining about something. ||||| Definitely.  The details aren't certain but Howard is definitely more cunning than he lets on.  You don't get that rich without knowing the fuck out of business ||||| He can't leave and he knows it. I'd guess he wants an all cash deal for another year or two so he can slowly sell of stock.  ||||| Good theory. And Howard's in a weird position when it comes to Sirius stock. His decision as you suggest will totally change stock price. So he has to be way careful about when he announces because he can basically get accused of Securities fraud if he's not careful or makes people believe one thing if he's already made a decision to go another way.  A precarious position to be in! Thanks for sharing.  ||||| Didn't Howard dump a lot of his stock already? I believe I read that somewhere, but I can't find a definite article source. ||||| somebody of howard's wherewithal almost certainly has serious financial advisers and lawyers who have had these questions and the answers to them accounted for since he took the stock options.

5788	1,3,3,3,2,3	6	I am just shocked by how Riot decided to handle the LCS spots rewarded. As you well know Krepo, Snoopeh and YellowPete recently lef the European scene to join NA creating a new team under the EG gaming house. Their spot in the relegation matches was secured by the EG gaming house probably for a large sum of money but is that what competitive league of legends is turning to? At the same time on the EU scene a large part of the last seasons roster of LemonDogs left to join NiP in the relegation matches and the LemonDogs roster was filled with players who never made it to the competitional scene. As of last week NiP did not make it through the relegation matches thus 3 players who last year made a name out of the Lemondogs team are now left not playing on a competitive level. ||||| Just like in normal sports, it's corporation based. ||||| It's for the corporation.  ||||| The corporation owns the spot and can make as many changes as they want during the off season. During actual splits I think 2/5 of the split starting team has to stay on, not sure if it's going to be the same next season though. ||||| So if the spot was for players, what should the Former LD team do?  Since they did a split?  Dexter - > CLG 3 to Nip Bjergsen to TSM. So who gets the spot of the former LD team if players get the LCS spot instead of the Major sponsor of em?  ||||| Yep, sport and gaming is about money. World isn't about butterflies, honor and tooth fairy. Realize that gaming is about money, RIOT is about money. Please hold your ideological bullshit to yourself.  1) Organizations like EG arent charity. They have sponsors, they must pay taxes, they want to get as much attention as they want. They wanted team in NA, they have it.  2) NiP players left LemonDogs because they got better offer. They wanted more money, they thought they can easily qualify just like they did with LemonDogs... and shit hited the fan.  3) LemonDogs organization had their spot in LCS, they earn it, with players that they owed, they paid them money. Players left, and they can make roster from bronze V players, or even with random persons its their spot. Its not new roster fault. Its NiP players fault who left. They don't need to play on a competetive level. They were recruited by organization. They want to earn money.

623	1,3,3,3	10	The story: As a poor young college grad I splurged a little bit to fly home to the midwest for Labor day weekend to see family and celebrate by grandfather's 80th birthday and was scheduled to fly back to my home on the east coast on Tuesday. Unfortunately, I became very seriously ill (hospital, CAT scan, so sick I couldnt even use the internet!) over the weekend and was rather obviously forbidden from flying by my doctor.   My awesome mom took the lead and went down to the airport before my flight with documentation from my doctor and spoke to a customer service rep who assured her it wouldn't be any issue at all, said he was updating the information with a future fictitious date to keep the reservation open, and to call the 800 number to choose a new flight whenever I was well enough to return home. Mom leaves feeling great, shares the good news with me, and I spend the rest of the week slowly recovering, at least grateful that was one thing I didn't have to worry about.  Fast forward to today: After finally getting approval to fly from my doctor I spent an hour on the phone (much of it on hold) trying to get a flight back this weekend so I can go to work on Monday.   Lo and behold, first they say they have no record of the flight being anything other than a no show--luckily my mother had written down the name and time of the rep she had spoken to, at which point they change their story to "oh, we have notes about it here, but not of the note your mother brought in, so that'll be $150 change penalty."After I argue on this point, since I have the letter right in front of me and the agent had seen it at the time, they agree to waive that, but at the very last step after choosing flights I am told it will be $270 due to fare differences because I am booking less than 14 days out, regardless of this being a rebooking of a medically delayed reservation.   Look, I get you they need to make money somewhere, and that tickets typically cost more closer to the day of, but is screwing over sick people really the policy stance your company wants to have? The actual cost of me flying last Tuesday versus this weekend should be negligible to the airline, especially since there were many open seats available.   I am so frustrated on the principle of the matter that I am considering booking a long haul bus back instead. Make me feel better about it by telling me when airlines have taken an already painful and stressful situation and made it worse.  TL;DR: American Airlines hates sick people, disgusts me so much I will probably take a 30+ hour bus ride just to avoid giving them another dime.   Edit: spelling ||||| Seems to be about a certain policy of theirs which would make it a systematic victimization.  ||||| delta. 500 to change a flight due to a canclled flight causing me to miss all connections. all might flights where booked through delta. but they just plain didnt give a fuck. and even said the cancelling of the flight wasnt their fault so i get nothing.....the fucking engine fire alarm went off 10 minutes in the flight so they turned us around....how is that not their problem.... ||||| When you buy a non refundable/non changeable airline ticket (or a ticket with the standard $150 change fee plus the difference between the old and new fare) you get what you pay for.

4163	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	26	My friend and I just got to Shadowfen at level 25 when we started using the double XP. After running through all our available Group Dungeons last night, we're level 34 and 90% of the quests we have from that zone are greyed out now. I'm a little disappointed that we've basically invalidated an entire zone that we barely got to see. Should we just do the zone's main quest to progress the Faction's story line?  How are you guys handling leveling so quickly in specific zones? Do you bother sticking around zones if you've leveled beyond it's means? ||||| Just doing the main quests (skill points) and getting all the skyshards, lorebooks (leveling mage's guild), and dolmens (leveling fighter's guild).

That stuff all scales to level so I can put it off till later. ||||| Just learn to ignore the XP. Do all the quests (gray or otherwise) for the story/adventure.

2592	1,3,3,3	4	I suppose I should clarify by asking: why does breathing pure oxygen have a different effect than taking in enough normal breaths to acquire the same oxygen as found in one breath of pure oxygen?  A friend of mine is a cop who takes hits off of an O2 tank between shifts and he says it has improved his stamina immensely.  Is he experiencing a bit of a placebo effect, or does it make a difference?  ||||| Depends how much hes chugging and for how long, but mostly its going to be a placebo effect.  You will fill your reserve capacity in your lungs with oxygen which is what we do if we are putting you to sleep before an operation before we get tubes inside you.  You'd be dead in about 90 seconds if your paralysed without oxygen but filling your lungs up with oxygen first will mean we have 7-9 mins. But you would also be blowing out a higher concentration of oxygen when you breath out. The reason this works is as most of the air you breath in the air is nitrogen (80%) your replacing the 80% of nitrogen in your lungs with oxygen. This may help but i would imagine you would get rid of this extra oxygen fairly quickly and it wouldn't make much difference, but this would again depend on how much physical activity he was doing, his reserve volume and his tidal volume etc.  ||||| It actually could have the opposite effect if he is forced to perform without it. Breathing in pure oxygen lets your body know that it can relax on red cell production by dialing back on levels of a hormone called Erythropoeitin. If he does this regularly enough and for long enough he could end up with a bizarre sort of self-induced anemia and feel exhausted if he has to perform without the oxygen tank. Long distance runners and Cyclists purposefully starve themselves of oxygen using altitude chambers and training at high altitude to trick the body into ramping up red cell production. This way, they feel more than "satisfied" with normal levels of O2 and will have overall higher red counts and oxygen delivery capacity.   You can improve hemoglobin saturation short term with taking breaths of pure oxygen but unless you can travel with that tank you're just going to harm yourself in the long run.    ||||| >why does breathing pure oxygen have a different effect than taking in enough normal breaths to acquire the same oxygen as found in one breath of pure oxygen?  Every time you take a breath, you're equilibrating the gases in your blood and in the atmosphere.  O2 isn't the only gas in your blood.  There is an equilibrium in your blood along the lines of: H^+ + HCO3^- -> H2CO3 - > H2O + CO2 .  Every time you take a breath, you blow off CO2.  This is an essential part of acid-base homeostasis.  Breathing faster, in the absence of other factors, will pull the net reaction toward the right.  This results in a loss of H^+ from your blood, a rise in pH, and (potentially) respiratory alkalosis.  By breathing pure O2, you take in more O2 per breath, but you still blow off a similar amount of CO2.  Also, you can hyperoxygenate yourself.    Before surgery, people often breathe a pure O2 for awhile.  This gives physicians and nurses more time to intubate before hypoxia becomes a problem.  Breathing pure O2 could conceivably extend aerobic endurance, but aerobic exercise tends to be long-duration, moderate-intensity work.  A hyperoxygenated state, on the other hand, doesn't last long after you stop breathing O2.  Your buddy is probably experiencing a nice start to his run, and a nice placebo effect afterward.  In athletics, you're more likely to see people sucking on O2 at altitude or after intense anaerobic exertion (i.e. players coming off the field at a Broncos game).

Better to KO your opponent before they kill you than barely avoid being OHKOd and doing little damage in return.  Power Whip or Gyro ball > Giga Drain. Ferro's special attack is way too low to be using Giga Drain. ||||| * **Heracross** Focus Punch isn't reliable without having the move substitude so I would have taken Swords Dance or Close Combat even if you can get it through baton pass, because you will loose your Sub for nothing.   * **Scolipede** looks solid.  * **Rotom-Wash** Looks solid.  * **Ferrothorn** Ferrothorns SpA is really low, you should take Leech Seed over Toxic and Power Whip over Giga Drain.  * **Talonflame** Looks solid.  * **Crobat** A jolly nature is better then a Hasty nature. Leftovers or blacksludge if you have another one, you could keep the sitrus if there is item clause.   ||||| [Here is a bReakMyTeam analysis of your team.]([URL]  *I am a bot that searches for RMT posts and automatically imports your team into [URL] The import may be partial or incomplete if you use Reddit formatting (e.g. bold/italics) or your team is not in Pokemon Showdown import format.* ||||| * Heracross  Why do you run Focus Punch over Close Combat ? You only gain 30 BP but if you are hit during charging your move you will be interrupted and relying on passing a Substitute and keeping it alive is very low. Close Combat should be enough from Heracross enormous 185 Att stat for most pokemon that come your way.  Personally I run Bullet Seed to deal with Water, Ground and Rock types (the last one to avoid the stat drop from Close Combat) instead of Earthquake, but I guess it depends on your team. Earthquake covers Electric, Poison and Steel types as well as Fire and Rock types that you already have covered with other moves too.   EDIT: Earthquake gives you better coverage actually, because it hits Aegislash.  * Scolipede   I assume you want to pass the speed boost to your Heracross so I don't think that Swords Dance is necessary. Heracross has a massive 185 Att stat as Mega and with Adamant Nature and EVs I don't think there are any clutch OHKO he can only gain with a boost (Correct me if I am wrong).  Instead I would run Megahorn or Poison Jab to avoid getting shut down by Taunt completely, you could even argue for a combination and leave out Substitute because a solid 100 Att allows Scolipede to deal serious damage. Protect Turn 1 and you should outspeed most things after that. (Obviously you have to adjust the Nature and EV for that).  * Rotom Wash  Standard Rotom-Wash set from what I can tell, I never used him.  * Ferrothorn   I don't find him to be a very effective pokemon on your team, his purpose is most likely to stall out pokemon that Heracross and the rest can't deal with in that case Leech Seed instead of Spikes will give you more residual damage and life regeneration. If you never intend to use him as a lead you might even want to change Stealth Rocks into Protect for one the best stalling pokemon with Toxic and Leech Seed dealing most of the damage and Giga Drain helping out as well.  * Talonflame  I prefer power over speed, you will at least get into a Speed tie with other Jolly variants, but against Choice Band you will hit them and then die in return :  1. (Adamant) 252+ Atk Choice Band Talonflame Brave Bird vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Talonflame: 312-367 (104.6 - 123.1%) -- guaranteed OHKO 2. (Adamant) 252+ Atk Life Orb Talonflame Brave Bird vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Talonflame: 270-320 (90.6 - 107.3%) -- 43.8% chance to OHKO 3. (Jolly) 252 Atk Talonflame Brave Bird vs. 4 HP / 0 Def Talonflame: 189-223 (63.4 - 74.8%) -- guaranteed 2HKO  So against opposing Talonflame you rely a lot on Stealth Rock support which is difficult to get up because a Choice Band Talonflame can easily OHKO Ferrothorn, although Recoil + Rocky Helmet + Iron Barbs will guarantee you a OHKO with your Talonflame.  Therefore I would choose Protect over Roost to be able to stall an important turn if the enemy is suffering from Toxic from your Ferrothorn or self inflicted status like Flame Orb. Sadly Talonflame doesn't get Whirlwind  to force out threats.  * Crobat  I like Crobat, but I think that I favor Cross Poison over Air Slash, simply because you have no Fairy coverage and U-Turn, Pursuit and Cross Poison all benefit from your higher Att stat compared to Air Slash.  * Overall   Your team has a weakness to Fairy (nothing resists it, nothing is super effective) as well as Psychic, Rock and Fire because many of your pokemon share these weaknesses. And without getting Heracross going with a couple of boosts you will be stopped quite fast. Heracross also has a weakness to Talonflame and as explained if you are forced to switch you risk losing more than one pokemon in a row (switching in Crobat or Scolipede probably kills them, Ferrothorn runs a risk of dying, Talonflame runs a risk of dying, only Rotom-W is a solid counter).  Lastly, since most of your damage will come from Heracross here is a small coverage check :   Close Combat/Pin Missile/Rock Blast/Earthquake have perfect coverage with 220 Neutral Effectiveness and 554 Super Effective.   ||||| Scolipede: why timid and spatk evs? With no attacks? ||||| I've used crobat before.  Brave bird is the best move you could possibly give it.  It hits harder than any other move crobat has.

I submitted a post of the Voice Acted [Hidden Lore]([URL] video on MrCreepyPastas channel and was a bit surprised it got 0 attention.

6026	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	I live in an attached house and after my boyfriend and I had a Christmas Eve party the neighbours left me an angry letter in the mailbox. At first I thought it was because of the noise, but it wasn't.   They were angry because someone mistook their house for ours. The person tried to open the door once and it was locked so they knocked. The neighbours answered the door and when the person saw that it wasn't the right house they apologized and left. These are basic facts written by both the neighbour in the letter and by the person who went to the wrong house.  However, in the letter, the neighbour completely exaggerates everything. He goes on for a good page about how terrified he was and thank God his door was locked, etc. And than he claims we constantly have people coming in and out of our house without knocking. Which is untrue. Obviously my boyfriend and I go in and out. Sometimes we tell friends they can just come in, but we rarely have people over (I can think of three occasions this year lol) and it has never been more than maybe 5 or 6 people.   I understand it would be frightening, but no one actually went into his house. It was an honest mistake. I didn't know about it until after the letter or I would have apologized. I left an apology note because it was late at night when I found it. He says if it ever happens again or if he sees the person go to my house (even if they dont knock on his door??) Hes going to call the cops...  Obviously he can call the cops for just about any reason on my house. But I can't actually get in trouble for this? Can I?  Edit: location is Canada. And I have warned my friends to make sure they have the right house already and will do so again when they actually come over again. ||||| Of course you can't get in trouble for this. Your neighbor is ridiculous. I would try apologizing to him in person. Not because you did anything wrong, but because you do not want crazy neighbors feeling antagonist towards you. Apologize that your friend scared him and say you'll do something like tie a balloon to the mailbox so future guests know which home is ours. Again, you shouldn't have to - and your neighbor shouldn't write stupid letters - but this should get you what you want.  ||||| Why would it terrify someone to have someone knock on their door, ask for a person, then leave when they find out they're at the wrong house?  It boggles the mind.  edit: unless of course OP is misrepresenting how their friend knocked, if he was excessively loud or intimidating, if he was especially shady looking, etc. ||||| You've done nothing wrong. Probably should tell your friends to be sure of the house in the future, to avoid this. Worst case scenario if he calls the cops is they show up, see no evidence of any wrongdoing, and then are pissed at the neighbor for wasting their time.   Also, if they put the letter in the mailbox themselves, that's technically a crime. Not that the police or USPS are likely to care.  ||||| I don't see any laws being broken here. Just tell anybody who comes over to be careful to leave the neighbors alone. ||||| Some people are just aching for the opportunity to create drama, and neighbors are a good source for that. Now that you have "offended" them, expect lots of retaliation, but I wouldn't worry about it unless they start calling the cops because you are simply accessing your own house, or visitors are coming over.  ||||| Just warn your friends that you have a nutcase for a neighbor ||||| [deleted] ||||| An angry letter is not a legal issue. 
6764	1,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,2	27	I saw the far off pearly white glow of the planet nestled in the inky blackness of deep space.  I knew it was a planet because the first thing you learn in astronomy is that if it does not sparkle it is not a star.  So beautiful...glowing like a jewel in the cosmos.  Am I looking through a telescope?  Why is Jason here?  He is not in my astronomy class.  He's an art school dropout.  "Dude wake up!  C'mon he's chasing the guy!  Let's go!", urged Jason helping me up.  I looked around and keeled over.  My balance was shot.  Sky, trees, grass and park all rolled past me as my head wobbled.  Jason dragged me down the path.  I left a trail of blood on the ground from my nose.  Dot.  Dot.  Dot.  "What happened?", I asked.  "Well he took your money if that's what you mean.  I told you to put it in your boot", said Jason pulling me through the bushes to a sidewalk and then across a street.    There were people here.  They stared at us.  In the reflection of a Cinzano's Cafe I saw my face.  My nose was puffy looking and blood oozed out.  The guy eating an egg and pickled peppers sandwich inside looked at me with disgust so we kept walking.  "Do you really think that guy was a cop?", I asked.  My voice sounded funny and thick.  "Lets hope not", muttered Jason as he lit a cigarette and helped me down the entrance to the BART station.  "Man this sucks!", said Jason puffing away angrily.  "Yeah", I agreed, "but at least we got away.  And maybe my nose isn't broken..."  "Not your nose!  The fucking heroin man!  We got nothing!"  I made a mental note not to share any painkillers with Jason that I might get from the school doctor and got on the escalator.  Jason jogged down the stairs and the wind from the train tunnels lifted his hair and jacket into the air like wings.  I leaned against the railing of the escalator and held my swollen nose.   Students of my university try really hard to look gritty and urban.  It's the effect of this city.  Like a giant pulsating heart, the city takes in ideas and personalities and pumps them through it's vast historical chambers.  Like a virus, this alters the very DNA of the idea and molds it to fit into the culture of the city.  This place changes you.  But the people who grew up in the city can always spot the students.  Students look a little too healthy.  They glow brighter with nicer teeth and wear expensive mall clothes.  Students also make easy targets because most students have money.  We were on the other side of the park.  Not the side where the students played frisbee or where the mother's pushed their baby strollers.  We were on the side were the unwashed masses of homeless kids clashed with the crazies, the pyschos and the drug addicts.  We passed a restroom where a wall had been transformed into an informational board.  All these pictures of missing kids with heartfelt messages to call home.  "Fuck you hear those stories about how someone is preying on homeless kids in this park?", asked Jason as we strolled beneath towering redwood trees that swooshed and swayed beneath a clear blue sky.  "Yeah they found a kid tied to a tree with his throat cut last weekend.  Somewhere 'round here...", I answered looking at pictures of all the missing kids.      We walked towards the fountain where people congregate.  The smell of ganja and patchouli oil wafted from a crowd of people with shopping carts, sleeping bags and dogs.  They looked like psychedelic gypsies.    "How are we gonna do this?", I asked.  I had never walked up to a stranger and asked for heroin.  "Easy", said Jason.  "Just need to find a junkie and ask him or her.  Too many hippies here though.  Lets try down there."  "Ok..."  We walked through the park and found some older homeless guys on a bench.    "Bingo!", smiled Jason, "notice the soda?  Not beer?  This guy likes H."  Jason strolled up to the men who stared coldly at us.  "You guys know where to score any H?" asked Jason loudly.  "Man get the fuck out of here!", yelled the man and he threw his soda at Jason.  "Whoa!  Sorry sir! ", said Jason and then to me, "Lets get out of here!"  We hurried away but another guy followed us so we stopped.  A middle aged guy drinking a beer.  "I can hook you up.  What are you looking for?", he said.  "Bundles.  Would love to make a volume deal...how much can you get us?", smiled Jason.  "I can get 10 maybe 12 right now...", the guy said carefully, "but I need the cash first."  "Nope", I said feeling very street savvy, "we need to see it before we pay..."  "Ok", the guy said fishing out a handful of bundles from inside his jacket, "Now show me some cash.  These are $65..."  "$65?", repeated Jason incredulously.  As they argued I watched a guy who looked like he was an office worker out for a stroll.  But he walked too fast and right up to us.  As he walked by he suddenly lunged at the dealer and grabbed his hand knocking bundles everywhere.  "What-!", yelled the dealer.  The guy held out a hand and pointed at us and held his other hand behind his back near his waistband.  "I am police officer!  All of you freeze!"  So we stood there.  But shock turned to fear as he pulled out a gun and pointed it at us while walking forward.  The dealer took one step back and CRACK! -the guy swung the gun like a club right into the dealer's face.  The blow instantly staggered the dealer who collapsed.  A tooth bounced in front of my boots.  "Empty your pockets boys!", the guy said as he stooped down and started grabbing bundles.  Then I did a foolish thing.  A very foolish thing that explains why my nose is crooked.  I stood up for myself against a man with a gun.  "Can we see your badge?", I asked politely.    He stared at me, uncocked the gun and put it back in the holster very casually.  He glanced around the park and turned towards me with a smile.  I never saw the punch.  Then I was lying on my back staring at Jason's concerned face.  I wondered if he knew what planet that was orbiting above us in the heavens?  "Dude wake up!  C'mon he's chasing the guy!  Let's go!", urged Jason helping me up.  I looked around and keeled over.  My balance was shot.  Sky, trees, grass and park all rolled past me as my head wobbled. ||||| Great story!

7924	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	11	I've been scanning old Slowcooking posts for a while now. I'm looking for something to 'Wow' a friend. He's not a snob by any means but does appreciate complex tastes.  For four adults, three kids.  7 qt or 5 qt cookers. Any suggestions will be appreciated. ||||| Your best bet would be to go with a solid protein, and add "magic" ingredients to it that aren't part of the slow cook.  Here's a great recipe for "fajita steak," but it's incredible as the base for steak tacos [URL]  That's the protein, if you want contrasting flavors and complex tastes, that won't happen in a crock pot.  Using the steak as your base, think about things that contrast.  The protein will be very tender and fairly savory.  To cut through that, think about something like pickled watermelon rinds or quick pickled shaved red onions with mustard seed.  As an alternative to lettuce, you could go with bok choy, maybe lightly wilted with some jalapeno.  Chihuahua cheese is pretty much always perfect for tacos, but if you wanted to try something different/fancy, with the acid from pickling, savory steak, and crunch of a green (even just lettuce), you could use a very fine and mild blue cheese or any cheese that's mild and creamy for that matter.  If you want to avoid that stuff and you have a food processor, get a bunch of jalapenos, DIY quick aoli, roast the jalapenos (poblano would work too), and puree into your aioli as an additional topping.  Anyways, hopefully this is enough to get you started.  But as other people have pointed out, there's no way to achieve this with a crock pot on its own, but you can set the stage with a nice protein and add other components.  Edit: Fresh limes and cilantro things too; always perfect.  Good luck!  ||||| I have to say that, based on my experiences in the various cooking subreddits, a Serious Foodie is possibly not going to be impressed by anything that comes out of a slowcooker.  Maybe reddit just has a statistically skewed percentage of crockpot haters, I dunno.   But anyway, it's difficult to come up with "complex tastes" in crockpot cooking, partly because complex tastes are also a factor of contrasts in texture. But since everything is braised together in the same pot, it all comes out "boiled".  Something that has simmered for 8 hours isn't going to have much left by way of complex tastes. Part of what slowcooking is, is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You don't end up with Dr Pepper and pork--you end up with Dr Pepper porky sauce, which is delicious, but not very complex.   Best I can think of would be a really righteous chili, but the kids probably aren't going to go for that.   ||||| Great advice above.  Adding contrasting texture is the best advice I saw when it comes to appealing to foodies.  Try plating a slow cooked protein on grilled polenta then add sauce.     buy rolled polenta, cut into 3/4" slabs, and then coat with oil and grill 20 minutes each side until crisp.  Top with protein and sauce, or do my favorite and top with grilled blue cheese stuffed mushrooms.  ||||| Beouf en daube.  My go to dish for entertaining, I put some stout in as well as red wine which makes a beautiful gravy.   [URL] ||||| Sometimes simple, done really well, is just as impressive.  With that many kids I might do a slow cooker spaghetti sauce with meatballs, you get a great depth to the sauce with slow cooking. Home made noodles, some really good artisan bread and olive oil for dipping, a nice salad on the side, (my favorite salad right now: boil 4 cloves of garlic until tender, put in the bottoms of a large salad bowl and mash with a fork, add olive oil, rice vinegar, salt/pepper, grated Parmesan, whole grain mustard and blend to make the dressing.  Add chopped romaine on top while toasting pine nuts, sprinkle the pine nuts on top and toss just before serving). Maybe finish with a nice homemade cobbler and really good ice cream (homemade if you have an ice cream maker).  ||||| This is super easy and delicious.  It's not done in a crock pot, but it's the definition of slow cooking.  The toughest part is finding the ingredients, but with the internet it's super easy.    Check this out.

The new story to be created may even reside in the same universe as Homestuck or,like problem sleuths, Homestuck may have been in the new story.

I grabbed another branch to help him... and then we became best friends. ||||| [deleted] ||||| First day at Uni, having one of those big tours of the campus+department. I get chatting to this guy who I happened to sit next to for one of the talks. He looks a little bit like a shit cartoon villain. He had the under lip triangle facial hair and everything. But we're not judging on appearances are we?  I wish I had judged on appearances.  This guy quickly became an absolute shitstain to talk to, unbelievably annoying and made lecherous remarks about any female that came by. And he kept getting Wotsit dust everywhere. He also told me, grinning, that he had bought a BIIIIG tub of vaseline for uni. I remembered how in school, once you were cemented in a friendship group you could be stuck in it for years and I was filled with terror that this bloke who looked like a determined sex offender would be who I'd get lumped with for the next 4 years.  When he said "you know how some people can throw their voices? I can throw my farts" I made an immediate decision to make friends with someone, ANYONE else.  I saw a semi-circle of guys standing around, with an empty chair in the middle. I sat in that chair and said hi, then laid on the charm thick and heavy. I needed this.  That was 9 years ago. One of those guys in that semi-circle was best man at my wedding a couple of years back, and I'll be best man at his in a few months. All because one reprobate tried to tell me about throwing his farts.  TL;DR I only sat and spoke to him because some other guy was fucking insufferable and told me he could throw his farts.  edit: Typo ||||| in my sixth grade I moved to other town so I changed my school. It was my first day to this new school when I had fight with this guy. Our class teacher caught us and told us to see principal. On our way to her office this guy asked me to save him from this because his mom works for the same school and it'll end up much worse for him. So I took the blame and told principal that it was me who started this fight( it wasn't me BTW) I was told off and we both were given small punishments. He thanked me all the way down the corridor. He asked me to become friends. That was the last fight we had in 7 years. ||||| I said a yo mama joke to a kid and he said his mom died. I felt bad and apologized to him. He then tells me he was kidding and his mom is still alive. And from that, a best friendship for 6 years and counting was born. ||||| Not me but my brother was a very troublesome kid back then, during 1st grade in elementary he had a fight with one of his classmates which ended up him stabbing the kid on the hand with a pencil. Our parents and the his classmate's parents were both called in to the school. When our parents met with his' my mom and and his classmate's mom were workmates and very close friends and the dads were also buddies. They just talked and laughed it off and the 2 boys were best friends ever since. ||||| I hooked up with a guy, he moved in. Found out he was married. After shit died down, met his kids and baby mama/wife. And then we became best friends! ||||| He joined my high school class, was assigned the spot right next to me, because I was sitting alone that period. We talked about games, skateboarding and math. The months after, we visited each other to play games and went skateboarding whenever the weather would allow it. And then we became best friends. We still are, 12 years later. ||||| I want to be able to post but I need a best friend :( ||||| I got a guy at another company into serious trouble after I complained about him. I then got a job at that company and he trained me. Great guy. We car pooled and everything! ||||| Back in highschool, one of the popular girls pulled some shit prank on me. I went to the principle and since she's done that kind of thing before, she was expelled.  A couple of days later, a bunch of her lackeys came to me and tried to get me to withdraw my complaint, threatening they'll get everyone at school to stop talking to me unless I do so.   I'm not sure how they thought it works, it's not like highschool is the justice system, but I told them they can all blow me and the sooner they stop talking to me the better. They went away, presumably to hatch some new scheme, but some guy came to me and said "hey, I overheard the conversation. I can't stand those assholes either. Let's be friends". 19 years later, we still are, united by our contempt for douches.  ||||| It was the second grade, I was young, dumb and thought I was the baddest mofo around because I was usually the tallest and biggest kid around. It was an average day, got onto the school and found a seat in the middle of the bus which I took all up to myself. We go through a few more stops and quickly the bus fills up with obnoxious snot nosed kids. We get to the last stop and this new kid I've never before seen come's strolling along the isle looking for a seat, to no avail. He then sees me sitting there taking up a whole bench seat to myself  being an overall little shit and he asks me if I could move in so he could sit down. Badass 8 year old me decided that this was the ultimate form of disrespect so i simply told him no and said to fuck off. He's now getting antsy as the bus driver refused to go till he sat down somewhere so in a last minute ballsy move he pushes my legs off the seat and sits down and the bus pulls away. This shocked me at first and I just froze for a second thinking how should I react. The bus takes off and finally hits a main road and continues to cruze. I saw this as the perfect time to reclaim my seat so I shove him with my elbow and get him off my seat, he looks back at me now angry as fuck because he fell onto the wet mucky floor of the bus and gives me this deathstare. It was at that moment that he stood up and with all his might jumped off the floor and onto me, kind of like Shane O'Mac when he does the leap of faith, and elbows me in the ribs. We go back and forth at it while everyone else just kind of carries on like nothings happening. After 4 more minutes of wrestling around I reached into his pocket and grabbed 3 bucks which I assumed was his lunch money and then put him in a headlock and gave him noogies as the kids on the bus began to walk off the bus and into the school. Somehow he managed to break free and rush off the bus. Sweet 3 bucks and now some kids scared of me, 8 year old me was pleased with the outcome. I get off the bus and walk into my classroom. I drop my hw off on the teachers table and out of nowhere I hear my name get yelled out by my teacher in a way thats usually only reserved for my mom. Fear struck I walk out of the classroom and I am greeted to that kid I just robbed of his lunch money and put through my 3 minutes of noogies crying to the teacher. Turns out the kid had my teacher the year before and had told her of what happened and then by some chance of god I happened to be in the classroom and I assume he saw me and pointed me out. The teacher made me give back his lunch money and then made me write an apology letter. Later on in the day I realized how much of a dickhead I was and felt terrible so when it came time to leave I found the kid on the bus and apolgized to him and told him I was being a jerk for no reason and feel terrible about. This kid, being the sweet and carefree kid that he was, said it was ok and offered me a seat next to him. I told him my name and he told me his and then we started talking about wrestling and videogames and thats how an almost 11 year and still going friendship came to be between me and one of my best friends Kyle. Man this story has me feeling all sorts of sentimental now I should shoot him a text. He's off in Ohio State now and I'm around town doing me at. Me and this kid spent numerous summer just hanging out, playing basketball, helping me out with my math hw when he came over to hang out and i had to finish my work. It's crazy how friendships start... Ahh I know he uses reddit from time to time so if you see this Non-Profile(inside joke) give me a holler man.  ||||| I once went to a fancy dress party and my mate bought me a Skeletor costume.

He was in town and a few others were coming out of their basements/blanket burritos to have a few drinks. He tells me he'll be waiting under a popular landmark.  I'm browny brown. He's as ginger and pale as a cherry lollipop.  I show up and this conversation ensues:  Him: Oi, Far too many browns here mate!   Me: They're my cousins, I'll tell them to back off.  We both said this loud enough for the said 'browns' to hear. Got a few looks, didn't give a fuck. A lot of casual racism and drinks later - we became buds based on the mutual, overwhelming urge to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.   [Nice one, bruv]([URL] ||||| I hated a guy in elementary school. We got put in a room together on a school trip, and found out we both were amazing at puns. Many puns later we are still friends ||||| The girl who I was in class with for the entirety of primary school, around grade 5 we kind of have a super cheesy Romance magazine for little girls book club, where we buy and share. Then I introduced her into anime. It went crazy. We went to different school after primary but and we met up and chat and share about anime at least twice a week. She's the longest friend I ever had. Then sometime in highschool I graduated from anime, she continued to be super addictive, in an direction of interest so different from mine. Then we headed off to different colleges. I'm shitty in keeping in touch, especially when we no longer have common hobby. But, thanks for the accompany through my childhood and youth, my dear friend.  ||||| 2nd week of college went to the gaming Society, and sat down played some MKX. Did a frame trap and the guy behind me asks "Is that a frame trap?" So I turn around and give him a devious smile. Him and another mate, who I also played with are kinda friends now. So that's pretty nice.  ||||| We were always pretty close (even before we were bestfriends) but i can recall a moment in the past when i thought "oh yep, she now thinks of me as her bestfriend" and thats when she showed me her butthole... i didnt ask nor want to see it but yeah...  ||||| I knew this kid and we always fought. We didn't get along at all. In one of these fights, he had me dead to rights. He was about to just pummel me into oblivion. In that moment, I mentioned my mom's name, and it turns out his mom had the same name. Been best buds ever since. ||||| 7th grade I faked an asthma attack to get out of running laps. They sent me to the small gym we had for the special needs kids. Inside was another kid who also faked asthma. We talked about DBZ the rest of gym. 15 years later and we're still best friends. ||||| This girl tripped me in 5th grade, and I wasn't having that shit because it was my birthday so she's going to have to get punched in the face or some sand in her shoes.  So I got right back up and said "Hey! You tripped me >:O"  and she was all "Yeah, and? >:("  Well that was the last straw. I swung and punched her right in the cheek. Not too hard, but just enough to knock her down. She got up slow, totally shocked. I was preparing for return fire, but she just looked at me and said "Wow that was pretty good."  I was confused, but I said thanks. From then on she didn't bother me and eventually we became really good friends all the way through high school. Now we are adults she explained she just wanted to talk to me in the first place so she'd get cake that day, as it was my birthday XD ||||| This creepy kid and I got in a fight, but then we realized both our moms are named Martha.

8277	1,3,3,3	6	Hello Everyone, this is my first post on this reddit. I may need some help because I am a bit confused. so, is Kaien (Fire Vagabond) Good? I really feel that he is. I am a F2P at level 30, with no luck, since I got it, I went to see his skills, and I think it's a good tanker. I know that Darion (Light Vagabond) is better, but let me know your opinions please!  Thank you and have a nice day! :D ||||| I think Kai'en is worth building if you don't have Darion. He is an excellent tank. Darion has passive damage reduction and a higher base HP, so Kai'en's abilities are outshined. They're otherwise very similar. Some people consider Kai'en to be the "poor man's" Darion. ||||| If you have dark Vagabond he is a bit better than Kai'en.  ||||| Just get Darion.. He's easy to get.

8114	1,3,2	7	I start a new game, and find food shortage in Corus as usual. So I get all my cargo load with food and get to there. Then the problem happens. THE PRICE- 40c per food Are u kidding? 40c when shortage? In this system? U serious? 0/10 shortage system. ||||| food shortage and trade disruption work mostly by manually hiding goods from the player (they are still in the market) and multiplying price for a number...  so if the price BEFORE shortage was for example 10 per food, with shortage it will end with 40...  Also there is no real shortage, thus the bizarre price (ie: the market actually has food, but it pretends it doesn't to give the player something to do, unfortunately this still affect prices, so the market price is of one that is supplied, even with a event saying it isn't). ||||| Wasn't it also around 40c before? I understand that food shortages are more of a way to play a charitable guy to a faction and gain lots of reputation not especially to make loads of money.
3501	1,2,3	5	[deleted] ||||| Where do you go to school? I know at my university the only way to pay for tuition with a credit card is using a service like Plastiq, and they charge something like a 5% fee, so that completely outweighs any points/rewards you'd get by paying with a credit card. ||||| The short answer to your question is probably no.   As RightOnEh mentioned, paying tuition with a credit card usually requires going through a 3rd party service, which will charge with with the fees, meaning you'll be paying an extra 2-3% to use a credit card.  Now, if there were credit cards in Canada with high minimum spend requirements for welcome bonuses (like in the US), this might be worth it. (For example, there are cards in the US that offer 100,000 bonus points with 10k minimum spend.)   In Canada, however, there are no cards that are both FYF (first year free) AND have high (i.e. 3k+) minimum spending requirements - AMEX Gold Biz used to be like this, but they've changed it. As far as I know, the highest minimum spending requirement on a FYF card is $500 (in 3 months) with various AMEX cards.   Unless you there is no fee for using a card at your university, I wouldn't put my tuition on credit card. I would instead meet the $500 minimum spend (for the AMEX cards) through other means.   As a final note, it sounds like you're just starting to get into reward cards in Canada. If you want some advice on where to get started and a possible road map, feel free to fire me off a PM. Good luck!

7346	1,3,3,3	6	So here's the back brief...  I was raised in a lower middle class family everything was normal. I think I still have odd memories from my childhood but I'm fairly sure it has to do with my friends mother not mine.(off track sorry)  I remember building my first PC at age 9. This is when the problems start. My mother and father all own their own business working 60+ hours a week. I am left at home and begin to start and become addicted to the PC. I got involved with MMOs at a very young age the first being Anarchy Online moving to DAoC and so on and so forth. I spend my middle school and high school life alone and in the dark on everything as I send every waking moment away from family and friends.(I had one friend though middle school and high school. Were still friends today.) At age 16 I am confronted by a kid at school asking me if I wanted to smoke some weed. I gladly accept as my views on it were fine as I've read a ton about it during my vast amount of time spent on the internet.   I then begin smoking marijuana everyday starting at age 16, moving on the next year my Nmom finds a Baggie with a seed in it and confronts me. She says my behavior is unacceptable and I am going to therapy or rehab. I am then forced every Saturday into an adult rehab class thing I don't even really know why I was there. If anything I learned more than I was "frightened" out of it. There was a crack addict there named Tommy aged 65 who I met and became acquainted with. He told me his thoughts on every drug he had ever tried. I took notes. Hiding them from my decades Nmom. This goes on for about 5months. January 8, 2008 I am at work(a part time job after school) I see police lights outside and they are digging through my truck that I had just bought with my saved money. I get a call from my dad asking me how I was. I say fine and he says "oh you don't know what's going on yet? I'm sorry son it wasn't my decision." I look left and see my mother and my aunt. A police office with a backpack with a bong, 2 pipes, an assortment of cigarillos, a small bag of marijuana, and my first Baggie of cocaine that I had purchased the night prior.  I am arrested. Fired from my job. And back in rehab.(the charges on posession and paraphernalia were dropped due to unlawful search and seizure. She told then it was her truck and I was "trafficking drugs")  I decide it's time to move out and I have no contact with Nmom or dad because I'm still mad at him. (Unreasonably no doubt at him)  2 years go by I have been selling drugs out of my apartment for most of that time. I also have 2 full time jobs and doing quite well for myself. I get in an argument with my girlfriend about "what I am doing with my life" I'm driving to work and I see a sign in big bold letters. Armed forces recruiting center. I call into work and walk in. I take a pretest and am told I can go to the MEPS station and enlist. I do.  2 days later, 1APR2010 I get a call from Nmom stating "they are at the hospital and it doesn't look good for your dad" I rush to find out he's been diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer. I quit both jobs and spend as much time as I can with him after Nmom has said to me "he was always on your side, even when I wanted to eat your ass or send you to jail. He always said He's just a boy he will grow up. Prove him right."  I do.  I still haven't told her I have enlisted and leave in august for basic training.  10July2014 my father passes away. I stay and Nmom cries on my shoulder for about 4 hours after. I've had enough and she has 30 of her friends there aswell. I leave.  19Aug2010 tomorrow's the day I leave for basic training. I go to Nmoms house and break the news I've enlisted. She doesn't believe me.  10 weeks later I call her to tell her I've graduated basic training. She's mad "I hadn't told her I was leaving sooner." I go to Alabama for a year then to Korea for 2 years, and North Carolina for the past year. I've decided to get out of the military and I'm looking at all my emails and snail mail.  She's somehow found out I am getting out.(no idea how.)  I call her she can't wait for "her baby" to come back home. I am going back home but not to see her. Not at all. I obtained a well paying job.  She has called my one and only friend from my childhood and teenage years and threatened him. To the effect of "if you even so much as contact him I will end you."  I want this woman out of my life and I can't seem to do it. Any suggestions? Sorry for the long read, lack of punctuation, and wall of text. I've never done this before.  Thanks in advance.  Edit: I've been sober since the day I found out my father was sick.  Accidently posted in /r/confessions...  ||||| Yikes. Out of curiosity what did your friend say to her? I seriously doubt she could do anything. But it's still creepy.   I say, if you don't want to have contact with her then, - CHOO CHOO! THE NC TRAIN DON'T STOP FOR NO ONE! - you have the power to ignore phone calls, emails, and texts. You owe her nothing. Block phone numbers, and emails. Don't respond no matter how much she pushes your buttons. Have your friend block her too. <3 ||||| Shoot her?  Nah you just need to go no contact. She doesn't want to be in your life to love you and get to know you, does she? ||||| Edit: I am not blind to the fact that I fucked up and was an asshole, however I feel betrayed more than once.

A simple swap switch from Spray nozzles to Multi-stream nozzles with save 35% water use OFF the bat (you dont have to switch out your spray body).  And just getting a smart controller with a rain sensor will save additional 25%.  Denver water will even pay you back for doing this. -> [Denver Water Rebates 2013]([URL]  Another tip.  Water your trees in turf with a 10 gallon bucket.  Drill a couple small holes towards the bottom for a small percolation drip.  SAVE THE TREES.

7258	1,2,0,3,3	5	Now, maybe I'm a little bit crazy, but here's the scenario. Imagine this: It's decades into the future, and SOPA has passed without the People's consent, so the government has control over the Internet and every bit of information and opinion that people wish to share--that is now subject to censorship. Also, because of the National Defense Authorization Act passed in late 2011, anyone who exercises their First Amendment rights, whether in protest, in conversation, or on the web in the unfortunate presence of a regulating force (police, FBI, CIA, etc.) is labeled a terrorist and sent to prison for a very long time (at least) for "disturbing the path to freedom" or whatever.  Now the question: If this future government could go to such great lengths to maintain their power, the political system is rigged against wise, intelligent, altruistic leaders, and revolution is imminent, what about those who choose instead to seek political refuge outside of the U.S? Could the U.S. close our borders to keep those of us unhappy but unable or unwilling to fight from escaping?  Tl;dr Could our corrupt government close our borders to keep those seeking asylum outside the U.S. from escaping? ||||| Who would benefit from this? ||||| Do yourself a favor and lay off the kool-aid ||||| Thats why we need to ELECT RON PAUL WHO IS AGAINST CIVIL RIGHT BENDING BILLS!!!! ||||| It's certainly possible the U.S. government, if it went in a totalitarian direction, would attempt to prevent emigration so as to avoid a "brain drain" of the educated. But the logistical difficulties of closing the borders are so great I have to think it's pretty unlikely such attempts would be successful on their own. The land borders themselves are really pretty massive, and efforts to control the flow of illegal immigration from Mexico have been more or less a complete failure.  What you'd see a lot more of would be internal controls and documents requiring travel *within* the United States. So you'd need official documentation and approval in order to travel between states or cities, for instance.   I think a more interesting proposition is if a more authoritarian U.S. *encouraged* emigration. It's no secret one reason why the Mexican government under the PRI in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s did so little to curb emigration into the U.S. was because it got rid of millions of extremely poor people who could pose a threat to the regime if ever mobilized by a radical-revolutionary force.

Day Z is also worth a look in. ||||| [Lone Survivor]([URL] is a kind of psychological horror, post apocalyptic, survival indie game. It's a side scroller with a pixelated art style, and you control a character who will get hungry, thirsty, and tired as time passes. I haven't gotten very far in it, but it's pretty fun and it's $10 on Steam.  ||||| I thought that I am Alive was a great one, but short. It has great bullet management mechanics and diverse situations. I think it is about $15.  Day Z is also awesomely in depth. ||||| Not post-apocalyptic, but there's [Notrium]([URL]  It's an older top-down shooter with a crafting system, constant resources to look for (food, energy, warmth, weapons), and it has a decent story from what I remember.  Can also try [Stranded II]([URL]  A lot less focused on combat and more about just surviving in general (food, shelter, makeshift weapons).   ||||| Metro 2033 is a great one. It's a post-apocalyptic game taking place in Russia's subway system. One cool thing was that a certain type of bullets are also your currency. Also, be sure to play it on Ranger Hardcore difficulty if you do get it. ||||| You should try Project Zomboid. I consider it one of the best survival games out there. It's a game based on the zombie apocalypse, Romero-style. However, don't expect it to be in fps style nor the likes of DayZ. It's retro-isometric in perspective. The best part about it is this:   Survive. "Surviving isn’t just about blowing zombie’s heads off. Depression, starvation, trust issues, loneliness, illness, insanity. These are just some of the things you have to deal with in Project Zomboid."  Build. "Build and craft items to help you stay alive. From weapons, food or traps to a simple plank of wood nailed to a door. "  Defend. "Protect yourself and your allies from the relentless horde with a range of weapons and defenses."  Check out the game [here.]([URL] ||||| Lone survivor. Even has mental health bars (hiddne of course) ||||| I wish there was a realistic mode in the later Fallout (3 & NV) games where instead of being able to carry loads of gear, you can only carry something like two weapons (a pistol and a rifle for instance, no heavy weaponry) and limited medical supplies.

Under the Ocean is in a payed (preorder) beta at the moment I believe. It has an interesting art style.  ||||| It's  not quite post apocalyptic, unless you count zombie apocalypse style games to conform,  however I recently heard about [The Dead Linger]([URL] and it may be what you're looking for.   ||||| If you don't mind horror you might want to give Amnesia a try. ||||| There is an indie game being developed called Under the Ocean. There is a short demo of the game available on their website. You have to find ways to get food (gathering\hunting) and keep your character warm. From what I have played it seems like it will be a great game. [URL] ||||| Amnesia: Dark Descent, which I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet. It has no combat at all in it, the only thing you can do if a monster is near is try to hide, try to run away, or die.  Not post-apocalyptic though. ||||| Well assuming you aren't talking about *horror* survival?  Well then Minecraft at it's core is all about survival...obviously a lot more has been added to it, but you start of with nothing and time is ticking for you to build a shelter before night comes.  If you want to add a post-apocalyptic slant then try a custom map like [HungerGames2]([URL] Meant to multiplayer, but it works well as single survival map too. ||||| After recommending Metro 2033, I just thought I'd point out how many ellipses you used. Not bad, just funny :) ||||| I'd stay out of Day Z until the standalone release. While it appears to have a survival genre, all of the hackers and in general assholes really make it less enjoyable ||||| Try Notrium [URL]   It's a 2D topdown survival game and probably a lot better than you would expect!

3883	1,3,3,3	4	For the last few years, i've been a zombie. I mostly just piss around watching tv or go on the internet, dont talk to people, and have no motivation left.  I've always been able to ignore pain, and this is no different. But in order to stop feeling like I do, I have to stop feeling.  If I let everything through, if I let my emotions and what has happened come back to the realm of reality, I'm overwhelmed with grief, guilt and depression.  So my question is, is it really better to go through all of that, or is it better to just ignore it all if it makes it bearable? ||||| This is a question I've asked myself (and continue to ponder).  Right now I'm of the belief that turning everything off is best.  I wonder how this perspective differs when looking at people who have good coping mechanisms vs. those who lack such advantages. ||||| I am still struggling with depression, but I feel like I'm making progress and headed in the right direction.  I lived in ignorance of most of my issues for many years.  Like, my subconscious blocked it out from my conscious mind.  I'd say the conscious mind still got a glimpse of it from time to time, but I chose to ignore it.  If you choose to ignore it, it will be like a wolf at your door...waiting.  If you let it in and learn to live with it, you'll realize that it's not as bad as you thought.  Please don't let that statement scare you.  I think learning to live with pain, specifically accepting the pain, is the first important step is overcoming it.    Accept part of the pain only when you feel you're ready.  Even just a little bit can help.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  Whenever it is that you decide to accept the pain, the most important thing is to be kind to yourself.  It may take a long time to work through it, and that's perfectly fine.  Work at a pace that is comfortable for you.  Don't judge yourself by other people's standards: "Why is it taking you so long?" No one knows yourself better than you, so have confidence that you're doing everything in your power to get better.  Baby steps.   This is from my experience dealing with depression and grief (my mother died 2.5 years ago).  I hope this helps you in some way :) ||||| I bury and/or ignore lots of reality to survive. I don't know any other way. I hate it either way, but letting the pain out hurts more. =/
4394	1,3,3,3,3	5	I mean,we have night and day,we have the stars at night,but why it's always dark on moon.And it's like earth on Mars.Compare these pics to understand me correctly. [URL] [URL]  UPD:Thanks guys,after your answers I realised that was a stupid thing to not know about it :D ||||| The colour of the sky is caused by sunlight light bouncing around within the atmosphere. At night, on earth, there's no sunlight so it appears black.  On the moon there's no atmosphere, so whether or not there's any sunlight, it still appears black. ||||| Earth has an atmosphere of mostly nitrogen and oxygen gas and this air scatters blue light. Likewise, Mars' atmosphere scatters different wavelengths of light because of the gases it contains, giving it a different hue.   The moon has basically [no atmosphere,]([URL] so there's no gas to scatter any light. ||||| the moon has night and day just like us. light is whereever the sun shines. and the moon rotates just like the earth. now the moon doesn't have any atmosphere like the earth does so they don't have any reflections of light. The earth's atmosphere sort of breaks up the waves of color in a similar fashion as a prism. But blue being the shortest wavelength is actually the easiest color to see in the sky. The moon doesn't have any of that in the sky it's basically moon surface and space. so you see only the darkness of space as you look out from the moon ||||| If the Earth didn't have an atmosphere, we too would have a black sky at daytime (also we wouldn't be able to breath, so that would be bad :P). The air scatters some if the light from the sun, making it seem to glow blue.
4506	1,3,3,3,3,3	8	I'm being offered Shattenkirk and Johan Hedberg for Lundqvist. While I need an upgrade on D (Green, Carle, Campbell, Morris, Redden), I don't like giving up King Henry for it.  This guy's goalies are Nabokov and Hedberg. My goalies are Halak, Lundqvist, and Anderson. Giving up Lundqvist will hurt me once Anderson comes back down to Earth, but Toews could help me win two or three stats I'm borderline on.  Would Toews for Lundqvist be a fair/good move? ||||| Hell no.  ||||| Lundqvist went #4 in my league. He's gonna do better. I'd say no and watch the waiver wire for people who can help you offensively. ||||| Don't trade with that guy, ever. Shattenkirk and Hedberg for Lundqvist is a joke and you shouldn't take him seriously for offering that. ||||| A goalie for a forward is pretty league dependent. It's not easy to gauge if Toews for Lundqvist is a good trade or not. ||||| Absolutely not dude.  When did Hank get picked in your draft?  1st round - for a reason.  Buy low, sell high.  Right now, you'd be selling low on him.  He should command Toews + a good goalie that has potential to put up 35+ wins.

Thanks folks! ||||| [Here]([URL] you go. ||||| Practice the same builds over and over. You shouldn't have a hard time learning the Protoss mechanics. Also, playing some team games is a good way to understand using cheese/three base+ macro.   Finally, as a zerg who switched to protoss, why do you want to switch to toss? I assume TvP is your hardest matchup, as ZvP was mine. What was so hard about protoss that finally made you do the switch? (the only reason I ask is because PvT is my hardest matchup now) ||||| I haven't played terran but as a Gold Toss player there are a few mindset changes that have to be addressed.  The first is that there is practically no early game harassing options when compared to the Zerg and Terran races.  Nothing like zergling runbys, banshee or hellion harass, muta harass or mineral line drops exists in the Protoss repetoire.  You can still do drops and dt harass ( which comes an hour and a half into the game ) but it feels kind of akward.  Unit composition is something that you have to stay on point of at all times.  I'm sure you have seen how nothing but marines early game can wreck a toss player.  Nothing like that exists on the toss side, I usually go 3-3-1 (zealot-stalker-sentry).  No sentries, you die, plain and simple, don't tech up to colossi, you die.  Also take into account the slowness of the toss army so if a base gets into trouble, you may end up having to lose it and catch the retreating army out in the open. ||||| Making colossi is a good talent toi have
2202	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	22	I think it's stupid that the only way to deal with closed-minded people is to just unsubscribe to the subreddit. I think many people make good points that are downvoted because they don't follow the hivemind.   I'm looking for a subreddit (or looking to start one) that will basically post links of reddit comments that are scored highly simply because it is what most people want to hear. The only way to have a reasonable voice heard is if someone digs through the comments and upvotes it.  I want people who are willing to question and criticize certain posts and discuss with others the best way to present whatever correcting information.   I'm finding it kind of hard to organize my thoughts, but this is the basic idea behind this potential subreddit. Feel free to comment. ||||| I don't think this is necessarily a bad idea, but I think it has some major hurdles to overcome if you want to get it off the ground.  Here's what I'd advise:  * Keep it positive.  Don't talk about "the hive mind."  Don't characterize comments or people as "stupid" or "close-minded."  You'd probably even do well to avoid the word "criticize" for the most part.  * Don't over-mod it.  You've seen the post where LouF talked about the dismal failure that was /r/IndependentThinking.  That place no doubt started in a hole, since LouF has made quite a reputation for himself, but using the ban function as means of maintaining a particular standard of discussion (namely his) only confirmed for onlookers that he wasn't really interested in discussion.  One thing that I've learned modding reddits is that you have to trust your subscribers and the up/down vote system.  If, in the end, you feel they've failed you, hand the reddit over to someone else and move on.  * Be really clear about how you envision the reddit working.  Start out with a half-dozen examples.  That'll help people understand what the place is for, and the examples will encourage them to give it a try themselves.  There's nothing more daunting than a blank (front) page.  * Touch base with [this guy]([URL]  That used to be a novelty account for pointing out the unstated assumptions in people's arguments.  It's since morphed into the guy's main account, but he might still be interested in helping out with something along these lines.  It's not really intended for the same purpose, but you might also want to check out [TheoryOfReddit](/r/theoryofreddit), since you seem to have some of the same concerns. ||||| I like the objective, but I fear the hivemind is too big.  Almost every thread has comments that have been modded artificially high or low.    If you make a brilliant new discovery that cures cancer, but your presentation mentions George W. Bush, you'll get downmodded into oblivion.  But if you post "gay atheists rock", you'll get upmodded to best comment of the day.  This is a community of fundamentally close-minded moonbats.  Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to fix it. ||||| While I'd probably not spend much time reading such an abstract subreddit, I believe you should name it ChallengeTheHivemind  (capitalization optional) ;) ||||| r/depthhub is kind of like that, but not really. Worth a shot. ||||| >I want people who are willing to question and criticize certain posts and discuss with others the best way to present whatever correcting information.

Each era has players who pushed the boundaries of what was possible, so who are your favourites? ||||| Pele, for introducing that exciting attacking style Brasil is now known for, and his efforts to grow the game in the USA.  Maradona - best individual player in history.  Cruyff - Total football, and the Cruyff turn (don't know where I'd be without it).  Zizou - Best creative player since Pele (I actually think he's better).

5001	1,3,3,3,3,2	10	I discovered geocaching yesterday, as I've developed quite a wanderlust recently, so I downloaded the app and set off on my way this afternoon. I started on a close cache that was about 1.5km away from my home. It was the last in a series of ten caches that together formed a trail through a muddy wood (forest) and I decided that the wet and windy weather would add to the fun.  After finding my first cache I was overwhelmed with a great feeling of victory and decided - as the sun was still high - to continue on the trail. I couldn't find the first cache, but I found the second. Then I wandered to the location of the third cache, but I couldn't find that one either after searching for about ten minutes in the spot. I continued on to the fourth cache, realising now that a pattern was developing of about 500-750 metres between caches, but the hills and weather made it feel like miles between caches.  I reached the location of the fourth cache and this was when the weather really started to pick up. Strong winds and rain battered me while I searched, before I found the cache under a few logs and the weather conveniently subsided. It was getting a little dark, so I thought I would have time to find maybe a couple more caches at most on this hunt.  Onwards on the footpath, I found the fifth cache easily and decided that the sixth cache would definitely be the last find. At this point, it is worth noting that my battery was about a third full and the time was just after five pm. My battery is good, so I know this means that I still have about an hour or two of usage left, which is plenty.  Walking along the footpath to the sixth cache, an inviting landmark caught my eye: a dilapidated shipping container. I climbed down the slope to investigate further. I saw another run down shipping container, but I didn't get a chance to investigate that one, as you will realise soon.  I took out my phone to take a few photos of the shipping container. It was unremarkable from the outside and the photos didn't come out brilliantly from a distance, so I got a little closer and took some more photos. As I approached the door of the shipping container, that was open, I shouted "hello" a few times, just in case this was the shelter of a homeless person, as I wouldn't have liked to have disturbed them. There was no response, so I went a little closer to look inside.  The container would make a basic shelter for a homeless person. Most of the roof had fallen out, apart from a few square meters of roof at the container opposite the open door. Parts of the roof were still attached and were creaking in the wind. I didn't get much of a chance to look around the inside, because the picture I took filled me with horror.  [URL]  I wanted to move further in to get a better picture, but I was frozen with fear and didn't dare move closer. The wind suddenly picked up and I'm not sure if the rain did too, or if the strong winds were making the rain feel worse. Safe to say that I gunned it out of there. I'm not sure now if anyone was in there, but I saw no movement. Nevertheless, I was really scared and decided to get to the road as soon as I could, rather than head back to the path which would have taken me back to the woods.  I'm not usually superstitious or anything, but by now I was shitting bricks. While running to get through the barbed wire fence to the road, I checked my phone as it was still in my hand, to see that the battery had died. I thought that was impossible, since it had about a third of charge remaining, but I didn't dwell too much on the thought because I just wanted to get away.   I got on the nearest road, which I was relieved to find was a road familiar to me with regular traffic and it was also the road I had turned off of to start my hunt. For the next ten minutes or so of walking, I was checking behind me every thirty seconds to a minute.   On my way back, I stopped at a pub I had walked past to calm down for a bit as I still had a bit of a walk home ahead of me. That's where I enjoyed a lovely mixed fruits Kopparberg and a cigarette to wind down after my crazy journey. ||||| [URL] ||||| Wow that's crazy!

I've tried watching gameplays video from GW2, but so far I haven't been able to pinpoint if it's like Amalur or a complete third option.  So I'm hoping someone here has tried both Amalur and GW2, and could say if we could expect something similar or should be prepared for something completely new. ||||| No idea since I haven't played the game...but I'm guessing most of the videos you've looked up don't have one of the key mechanics in the game...that good old dodge button.

[URL] ||||| [deleted] ||||| From my ingame experience (3 demo sessions @ last summer gamescom) I can tell you that it's not like Amalour. Think of it like the standard everquest (wow, swot, etc) system that has moved towards an action oriented system but it's not there yet. Now, we can argue about the definition of an action oriented system vs. skill bar system but if you have played dcuo or tera or amalour, GW2 is not like those. ||||| [removed] ||||| me and my mom think all games are unique. ||||| me and my girlfriend were wondering if you and your girlfriend have even tried to youtube any gw2 videos to answer your own question. ||||| It's fairly similar but you won't be able to spam dodge in GW2 like you can in Kingdoms.  Dodge requires a resource called endurance.   [URL]  [URL] ||||| GW2 will not feel like a console game like Amalur does though, I hope. ||||| Having only played the demo of Amalur and GW2 PvP for an hour at a convention I'd say it is more comparable to Age of Conan except more responsive and less clunky in terms of gameplay.  But if you've played WoW/SW:TOR and Amalur I'm sure you won't have much trouble with GW2, since this is really a game you can pick up and play without having to even check your keybinds.  The press videos just make it seem otherwise. ||||| Yes, comparable to Amalur. ||||| Hello friend.

There are two ways to look at this question:  **Animation**  Probably not the scope you had in mind, but Reckoning's combat animation is tailored to make every single swing *really* look like they deal massive damage. From the humble giant hammer to the fancy faeblades, each and every swing provides all the perfect feedback cues: you can *feel* the weight behind the ponderous greatsword swings, *see* its carnage as enemies are tossed aside or simply crumple into a heap of loot, *hear* the sweet sound of a massive blade slicing through air, Prismere, steel, leather, cloth, flesh, bones and out the other side.  The same, sadly, can't be said for GW2, as far as we've seen.  **Mechanics**  This is likely what you were meaning to ask, I suppose. The answer, then again, is reliant on how deep you want to dig.  On the surface level, yes both are similar play styles because each has a dodge button. Both dodges also allow you to dodge twice before it goes on cooldown, albeit Reckoning's significantly shorter.  Dig a little deeper and you start to see the two games similarities fall apart because, as we all know, all muds are not equal, my dear; you must take into consideration the metals in the biological materials in your sample. Something as common as an embedded fossil could throw off the *entire* equation.

Do you control the network you're connecting to (aka, this isn't a dorm room)?  Does your router support UPnP?  The fastest, easiest, and best way to fix NAT problems on Xboxes is to use a router that supports UPnP IGD and let the Xbox handle requesting its own ports.  In fact, that's the *only* way you can have two Xboxes on the same NAT network with Open NAT settings.  Failing that, the alternative is to forward port 3074/udp, either through port triggering or manually.  But of course if you don't own the network, and thus can't make changes to its configuration, then none of that matters and you're out of luck.

1494	1,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3	41	/r/Libertarian:  I have a question about the long term sustainability of the gold standard. The whole idea is that the amount of gold doesn't change quickly so it prevents credit expansion. But what happens if one of the following events occurs:  * [Deep ocean mining]([URL] technology matures and allows the recovery of large gold resources on an irregular and unpredictable basis from the ocean floor. * [Asteroid mining]([URL] matures and discovers large gold resources on an irregular and unpredictable basis from space. * [Nuclear transmutation]([URL] technology becomes cheap and allows gold to be created from other elements. For example, gold can be created by bombarding mercury with gamma rays. If this process gets cheap (say in a future with massive numbers of [IFRs]([URL] [LFTRs]([URL] or [fusion reactors]([URL] then it may be feasible for us to create and destroy gold at will.  There are also other scenarios. There was a famous example of a major shipwreck during the 1849 gold rush that lost a massive amount of gold and caused a fairly significant change in the money supply.  All three of the technologies mentioned above are likely to mature during the 21st century, so how exactly does the gold standard (either government backed or free banking) deal with this?  ||||| A few points.  1. Yes, the gold standard is not perfect - but better than what we have. (In all honesty a computer running a fiat supply would work fine, but we could never trust the computer / operators / programmers)  2. Even the things you mention take *work* to 'mine' that gold. That effort is much more than the effort currently needed (typing numbers into a computer screen). That effort doesn't come free so the money supply still wouldn't expand at the same rate it does today.  3. Competing currencies - with no legal tender laws - would mitigate these problems. As one currency got too plentiful, something else (platinum, palladium, etc) would take over.  4. The move away from our current scheme isn't solely because of expanding money supply. Not only is our current money *fiat*, but its a form of *debt*. All money currently in existence only comes via one of two ways (1) Fed buys Treasuries, or (2) Banks make loans....in both cases that money demands interest to keep it in existence. This presents a basic systemic problem that can never be overcome, which is, the total debt in the system will constantly grow. Therefore, even a move to just a "greenback" (ie. fiat with no debt) would be better than what we have now. We have the worst of all possible systems currently.    ||||| The real question is weather any of those techniques would increase the supply of gold in the foreseeable future faster than fiat currencies inflate due to printing. I strongly suspect the answer is "no". ||||| > The whole idea is that the amount of gold doesn't change quickly so it prevents credit expansion.  Credit expansion comes from savings, not an increase in the money supply. ||||| I'm a fan of a gold standard, but not solely gold.  I'd like to see banks and private individuals being able to print money based on anything.  If gold increased in supply, it's value would drop, which would mean having money of all kind of currency would help. ||||| The biggest problem with a relatively-constant-amount currency standard is the fact that the population is still growing pretty rapidly, which has big repercussions in terms of both per-capita wealth and how much liquidity there is relative to the size of an economy.  Like mattrapt & ElectricRebel has mentioned, I've also thought that the energy currency idea was a very interesting one. I'm not really sure you need to relate an energy currency to some kind of physical (mass-based) substance though. How about a currency based on Joules (unit of energy)?  * It's relatively independent of political manipulation of the monetary system (since it's based on measurements of an actual physical nature),  * it will cause the overall size of the monetary system to automatically grow or shrink depending on economic activity (providing a negative feedback to counteract both inflationary or deflationary pressures) because a more active economy requires more use of energy, whereas a slowing economy will require less use of energy,  * You don't need a centrally-controlled printing press to increased more monetary supply - anyone running a power-plant of some kind, whether it be nuclear or solar panels on your roof, is essentially a printing press creating "energy credits".  * The main role that the government would have (if any) is to set standards for tracking/trading energy credits & tracking down fraud.  * Conservation of power/energy, in any form that manipulated "energy credits", would become a no-brainer savings activity (since every Joule saved is exactly the same as saving money).  It would be cool if a real monetary-system expert did an analysis on the pros and cons of a energy-currency based monetary system. ||||| [empty] ||||| [deleted] ||||| And why do we need to settle on a gold standard?  Why not allow the market to determine which currencies are in circulation. ||||| Competing Currencies would really be ideal. ||||| Which event is more likely to happen?  Any of the scenarios you propose or a government simply printing more money?  A major expansion of the gold supply would decrease the value of gold.  That is a given.  Your scenarios are much, much, much less likely to happen.  Good grief.... you suggested alchemy as a reason against a gold standard... ||||| I think the point is to have competing currencies with differing commodities.  I personally like the idea of an energy currency, which will most likely be possible in the near future.  Gold is just what is currently a very viable backing for money, and it has been throughout human history.  Silver backed money is also very good, because it has a very wide range of practical uses. ||||| Other than the first example, we'd be SOL on investing in just about any material.  Even money is unsustainable in the long term if all resources are transmutable or in great abundance.  In fact, given the physical properties of gold, it would still likely be one of the longest sustained elements in terms of value.  One would expect that eventually the costs of production in a transmutation scenario would fall in line proportional to the respective atomic weights of the elements involved.  It would be easier and less costly to transmute hydrogen into helium than mercury into gold, since mercury is rarer than hydrogen and contains its atomic weight in hydrogen.  It would already be this way if their distribution on the planet was uniform.    Basically, if you can cheaply transmute into gold, then you can even more cheaply (in terms of energy cost) transmute into every element on the periodic table below gold.  Consider the implications of that.  If I had gold, that gold would be worth its atomic weight in hydrogen, it would be worth its atomic weight in mercury.  Gold would be a far more compact representation of those two elements, so it would have a higher value.  Over time *everything* would be based on energy cost of production, and eventually we would realize the star trek "replicator" device.  In that kind of society, you would face a lot more changes than just the cost of gold.  In fact, you probably wouldn't even care if gold tanked because of that, because even if gold was the first to go (which is unlikely), most everything else would follow after.  As for asteroid mining, there is little incentive to do it right now because we haven't used up all of our supplies of gold.  The cost of gold is not yet high enough to justify an asteroid mining operation.  It would be far more costly to launch a vehicle (made of of special materials themselves) into such an inhospitable environment as space to mine an asteroid.  Even if you carried out one launch and built all the machinery up there, the transportation, assembly costs, and mining costs would be considerably more than the value of the gold returned.  The cost of gold would go down, but the cost of other things used to mine it would go up.

Was hoping it would be a fun enough app, but this is a rough launch. ||||| I agree, the only reason I can see them doing all the bundles is to meet some sort of minimum profit number that they need to hit.

It really is a darn shame too, I had high hopes for this app. ||||| Yeah, I'm waffling on this one so far. Love the subject matter. Hate hate hate the way they rolled out marathons. Pumped a ton of credits into the first few days to get the early marathons. Came up completely empty. Loving the conv set, really nice looking cards even if there are too many variants. (3 is max IMO). Was sorta liking portraits until they released the walker insert. Really? A walker insert? Strange enough who they chose for S1 base, major characters missing, other characters duplicated over and over, and walkers out the arse.

I had just gotten 4g of some really stanky stuff from my dealer and was about to pack a bowl. Underestimating the potency of this weed I smoked the rest of yesterdays bowl and then packed a rather fat one and smoked that whole thing as well. I go back inside and I can already feel it, like my feet were so heavy they just went through the floor when I tried to step. Anyways, I was sitting back in my room and watching YouTube when I suddenly feel like I'm falling and I jolt up in my chair. The whole room is spinning at this point and when I look down I realize I threw up all over my chair, the floor and my lap. So what does [10] me decide the right thing to do is...? Well I ended up stripping naked and passing out with puke still all over my legs and in my chair.  TL;DR: Got to my first [10] and ended up naked and covered in puke.

4439	1,3,3	4	I am very confused by Gorillaz as a musical project. I understand the "virtual band" concept, as it's been done by a few other bands (like Dethklok), but apparently they have a really long, complex backstory, starting from their initial album and music videos.

All the basic points are there though. 
4281	1,3,3,3,3	7	Apologies if this has been hashed to death elsewhere, I did a search and nothing came up. I am a long time hodler of bitcoin but recently my interest has been more and more piqued by what is happening over here. I know that there is a change to POS in the future which will put the transaction limit into the stratosphere. What happens if POS is deemed too risky between now and the implementation? The current implementation allowes roughly 20k transactions per second, correct? Is blocksize also a limiting factor in ethereum? Are the tradeoffs (security & decentralization) also similar? ||||| There are some good answers about this on Stack Exchange: [URL] ||||| [Earlier thread on same topic]([URL]  There are only partial answers, or directions for research.  Non-POS related scaling solutions:  * Sharding (similar idea as Peter Todd's Tree Chain concept in the Bitcoin world) * State Channels: similar idea as payment channels/Lightning in the Bitcoin world   Vitalik seems to be pretty optimistic on these 2 developments.  Most recent interview I heard about it: first part of [URL]  ||||| If Ethereum were tomorrow to become used by the entire planet, it would *technically* scale. There's **not** a fixed blocksize: miners can vote the limit up and down every block, and by default they aim to have the limit be %150 of the exponential moving average of use.  In practice, things would start breaking as the transactions per second increased. We're not sure exactly where that practical limit is, as during a previous testing phase the network was deliberately spammed as hard as it could and it still held up. But the overall issue remains in every crypto: how can the network support the volume of Visa without the expense of every node being Visa? ||||| It's simply because Ethereum has no limits as Bitcoin does. See [URL]  Blocksize is not fixed, transaction size is not fixed. All that is out there is the Block Gas Limit which is by default 3,141,592 gas per block, but it automatically can adjust as soon as there is steady demand.  See also my experiment on increasing the block size here. [URL]
4366	1,3,3,3	4	[empty] ||||| Taken from Wikipedia:  "Paper cuts can be surprisingly painful as they can stimulate a large number of skin surface nociceptors (pain receptors) in a very small area of the skin. Because the shallow cut does not bleed very much, the pain receptors are left open to the air, ensuring continued pain. However, the cut can also be very deep, in which case a puddle of blood pools around a longer gash. This is exacerbated by irritation caused by the fibers in the paper itself, which may be coated in chemicals such as bleach. Additionally, most paper cuts occur in the fingers, which have a greater concentration of sensory receptors than the rest of the body." ||||| When I worked in the diazo industry (making copies of blueprints), the paper cuts were evil.

7030	1,3,3,3,3	7	Hey everyone,  A few years ago my wife and I refinanced our mortgage to take advantage of low rates. We were able to significantly reduce our monthly payment and move from a 30 year to a 15 year mortgage. Overall, it has been great, but...  For the past two years in December we have been notified that our escrow account had a shortage, and that we need to either pay a lump sum or increase our monthly payment to cover the difference.   I have a healthy distrust of any large financial institution, and I have a hard time figuring out why our bank can't accurately calculate what payment we need to make to have the correct amount in our escrow account.  So, my two questions: are we being screwed? Should we pay the lump sum or let our payments be increased?  Thanks for the advice. Happy new year! ||||| No.  You're not being screwed.  The bank can only calculate your insurance and tax escrow rates based off of what they have *already* paid out, i.e. last year's amounts due.  When they have to pay out more due to an increase in taxes and/or insurance, then the mortgage company "fronts" you the funds necessary to cover the deficit in your escrow account.  Then they reevaluate the amounts escrowed.  When they find that you haven't been paying enough into your escrow account, they will adjust your monthly payment to reflect the shortage in the escrow account.  Keep in mind that the new escrow amounts **include** the new amounts they will be collecting in anticipation of next year's escrow disbursements.  So, it looks like you're getting double dipped, but you're not.  You can get around this a few ways:  - If you have paid off at least 80% of your mortgage, the Loan-to-Value ratio (current mortgage principal balance / current home value x 100) may meet the lender requirements for you to be eligible to close the escrow account and make the tax and  insurance payments, yourself.  - As soon as you know what the future amounts due will be, you can make a payment directly into your escrow account, so you will not have a shortfall when the payments are disbursed.  - Forward all tax and insurance bills and increase notices to your lender.  That way, you can have them reevaluate the escrow holdings to ensure they are collecting as close to the right amount as possible.  But it happens all the time.  You can pay the lump sum or make payments.  The mortgage company can not hold the escrow shortage against you, not can they charge you interest on the escrow shortage (U.S.).  As long as they get their money...  Source: used to service mortgages.  People HATE it when this happens. ||||| Tax rate and/or insurance premium increases ||||| > I have a healthy distrust of any large financial institution  They provide you a complete breakdown of all escrow activity. If it's wrong, you can dispute it. ||||| You don't usually need to pay escrow if you don't want to, it's a convinience.   You can pay your home insurance and taxes on your own, put the money in some kind of savings, earn the interest of it, and pay the bills as they come due.

1682	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	37	I made a post yesterday in the film room thread, but after getting a suggestion to make a separate thread I kinda had to make one.  This is a series where users of /r/nfl_draft collaborate together to try and come to a conclusion on different statistical remarks or at least some way to learn more about a prospect.    ---   Everyone who participates is assigned a prospect (of their choosing) and everyone follows the same approach to try and come to a conclusion on what prospect is best, what some of the weaknesses are and some areas the prospect excels. Lastly each prospect will be compared and hopefully it will illustrate which prospects are superior heading in to the 2016 college football season. I'll likely try and organize a similar series after the college football season to show how the 6-10 prospects did in their final year in college, and how they improved/regressed from 2015.   It contains extensive analysis of prospects, as there will be six games where you review each play to determine certain tendencies and areas of strengths/flaws in a prospects game. Statistics won't give you the full picture, but experimenting and taking a more moneyball approach is an interesting way of getting better at scouting.  ----  Starting of there will be analysis of quarterbacks. The plan is to show how accurate a quarterback is. How accurate is the quarterback on 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th down? How accurate is he in the red zone? Early or late in game? Short, intermediate or deep passing game? What formation does the prospect have most success in? What route combinations does the quaterback have most/least success with? How does the prospect do against pressure? How does he account for the extra blitzer and how does he do on the run where he has to extend plays?   Each play will be charted using the same method. Each play will have a detailed explanation, from down and distance, position on the field, formation, how many steps, what route the targeted receiver ran, if it was a scramble, if it was a redzone play or a TD. How many reads did the quarterback make? Was it a catch, if not, why? Was it catchable or a bad throw? Was it interceptable? Was it dropped? Was it thrown away? Underthrown or a wide receiver adjustment?    So you probably get the hang of it now, it will contain every possible statistic you can find in the play. It's very important that you have time to do this if your going to volunteer. It will take time and you'll have to note down a lot of different things for each play, but it's pretty straight forward if you invest time.  I was originally going to demand that everyone had to GIF each play, but I've decided to loosen up if you can't for whatever reason gif each play, you'll have to time mark each play so people who wants to check out each play find it.     In addition to the statistical part of the series, you'll also be providing a scouting report on the player. What strengths he has, what weaknesses. Doesn't have to be the longest, but just give a solid explanation so people get a better feel for the player. Things like mechanics including footwork, pocket presence, decision making, anticipation etc.    Dependent on the feedback and interest, how many people who want in on the fun will determine how many quarterbacks are reviewed. It's important that you have a quarterback who played in at least 6 games in 2015 and that you can find 6 game tapes from the prospect. I'll be able to help with cutups if necessarily. I'll also have a say in what games you review, as good competition matters. The teams bowl game will also be a must.   The 12 players down below are just indicative and a guideline, if you rather want to do another prospect say so, and if there isn't enough interest for 12 prospects than the list will get shortened to however many we are. Hope as many join as possible, as it's a fun community activity.    ---  **Prospects for this series**:   - Baker Mayfield (/u/Mit_Romney) - Brad Kaaya (/u/charliemann) - CJ Beathard (/u/flimflambam - Chad Kelly (/u/down42roads) - Deshaun Watson (/u/evanveto) - Deshone Kizer (/u/SaltineStealer4) - Gunner Kiel (/u/dirkthesexytoddler) - Joshua Dobbs (/u/yoyoyodawg3) - J.T. Barrett (u/FinleytheHuman) - Luke Falk (/u/sio-kedelic or /u/charliemann)  (If you want to do him leave a comment)  - Mason Rudolph  (/u/enfyte416) - Mitch Leidner (/u/FinleytheHuman) - Patrick Mahomes (/u/dseals) - Patrick Towles (/u/axberka) - **Seth Russell**   ----  As for timeline and when you need to get this done, I haven't decided the exact date, but I'm feeling flexible and really open to whenever people can get it done. If you can get your analysis done in two weeks, fantastic, if you need a month, no problem and if you can't get it out before early July fine. Potentially 12 different players will require a gap between each post, so really it all comes down to when you have the time to do it.   If you have any questions, want to join and take a prospect, either send me a PM or comment down below. If you've never participated in something similar before, don't worry, I'll hopefully guide you into the right direction. If you don't feel you have enough knowledge on how to do it, don't worry, I'm sure there are plenty here that will teach you everything you want to know about x's and o's. No shame in asking. This is meant to be a fun exercise for anyone and everyone.    The layout will be the same for each prospects, so you'll have to follow my layout. That is non-negotiable, so unless you want individual glory, you'll have to do the analysis the same way as everyone else. This is simply because at the end after all posts, there will be a comparison which requires consistent analysis. The layout isn't done yet, but [here]([URL] is a sneak peek on how the statistics will look for one prospect, there will also be an additional sheet that will count up each play.       ||||| You know, Unless you are really against giving two prospects to one person I could go for Mason Rudolph as well. Or you can give someone else Watson and give me Rudolph. I honestly thought you were only going to do the 6 you listed in the thread yesterday but I'd prefer Mason since he's my guy.  ||||| I'll take Joshua Dobbs.  ||||| If there is a qb that isn't taken with games the 6 games of film you can give me whomever, I'm not picky.  ||||| Beathard  ||||| I'll take Chad Kelly. ||||| I can do gunner kiel ||||| I could do kizer ||||| Hey I'll do Deshaun Watson ||||| I'll do Leidner ||||| Love the idea. Will take any QB available  ||||| For scrambling, is it any time they run (designed or not), or scrambled in pocket then threw it? I would like to add some sort of category for when QB runs pasted the LOS when he could of stayed behind the pocket and threw it. Thoughts? ||||| Hey dude, I actually don't think I have the energy to do this project right now :(. I was kinda hoping that fire to scout would be back by now, but I think I'd rather somebody else do Falk unless you really can't find anyone else. ||||| I'd really like to give this a go... But I don't know many names in the CFB industry, and given the list of names already, I don't think there's a lot of names out there that are big name QBs for next season... Maybe you wanna start another position? ||||| I would love to sign up for this. I'll take a crack at Watson just to give another perspective on him. I'll post all of my notes whenever I finish charting him, though I won't start that charting process until after I finish my Osweiler video
8600	1,3,3,3,0,3	20	what the FUCK.  wtf is wrong with some of these people.   So here i sit, thinking i should play some TF2 again since its been a few weeks. i go, buy me some tour tickets, and play a fun round of MvM just because why not.  I play it, do my demoman job albeit not beeing really good and having low damage and score overall, get a tin hat drop, leave. great, had fun people were nice.  Then i go for another round, i pick my scout which i couldnt in the first game, go do my job. I outdamage our demoman, whilst picking up cash, milking every sentry buster and giant scout and apply fan o war crit to giant bots. all in all i missed 11 dollars up until the finale wave, which was inevitable because some derps think its a smart idea to use the teleporter and kill bots at random places while everyone else barely holds off the incoming bomb carrier and tanks.  Last wave, i respec into a bit more of a damage scout, honestly not that bad and i think 2nd best tankkiller in the game. i do really well, but ultimately we failed the last wave. Mind you i catched up with everyone but 2 in terms of damage, but round lost stats reset. Aight, fuck it i go sniper, with hitmans heatmaker i usually destroy absolutely everything.  Round starts, i outdamage everyone by far. i always take mental notes of the damage dealt, just to have a comparison for my own perfomance. Its going, i have a good spot, i killed every group of medics upon their spawn, annihilated big groups with explosive headshots and outdamage our formerly best damage dealer by 3-1. We lost the wave ultmately at the last batch of spawned bots.   3 out of our 5 people were super heavy to carry this far, i mean real bricks. me and this other rando dude carried them into the final wave.  So, last attemtp at final wave lost, the 2nd time, stats reset, and i sit there with just a tad more damage than our demo, whilst having the sniper selected.  what happens next, a player joins, the last spot, finally! should be easy now. He picks scout (i saw him use the dodge drink) he pressed tab (probably) see my sniper with barely more damage than the demo, and decides to start a kick vote. and it fucken passed. ?????????????????????????????????  Damn guys, i was tilted harder than i ever was before while playing a game, and i play league of legends on a reasonably high level for years now. On euw, the motherhood of toxicity. it is incomprehensible for me how that vote passed. that happened yesterday and i still feel a little rage upcoming in me.  The only redemption i can have is that i know they must have had a very hard time even coming that far in the last wave.   I dont know if i lost the duty ticket, i believe they only get used up when winning or its used up, i dont even care about that. But damn my time got wasted bringing those nubcakes into the last wave and then beeing booted out.  After the kick my screen stayed black, main menu did not load, nothing happend.   Close Tf2, play league with a friend, find some englando people to fill our group. At this point i feel like im too old for tf2, even tho i enjoy the game. Must be a rare occurance to find friendlier people in league than in tf2, really rare.  Anyway, just wanted to rant a bit, if u have read this far, whats wrong with u, there are better timewastes out there. sry for the timewaste wall of text, nothing good happens here. enjoy ur sunday. ||||| Most people accept without thinking, but what the heck was going on in their heads?  ||||| > milking every sentry buster  -cringes-  Also I would like to clarify with the scoreboard, when a new player joins a mission in progress, to them there's no preexisting damage, support, healing, cash, etc stats, it all starts at 0 from the moment they join.  The only think that does show is the overall score (which is also something that doesn't reset on wave loss).  It's hard to say without actually being there or hearing from the other players, but the person who joined probably called it purely based on the fact that you were Sniper (i.e. non-meta).  As for the rest of the players it could've been they just voted yes to get rid of the pop up without considering what it was, or they scapegoated you, being the former Scout who missed some money or the new non-meta class.  Could have been something else that annoyed them, but again, it's hard to say with only 1 side.  i wouldn't get too miffed about it.  You'll always have some bad eggs with online play, especially when people are "spending money" (costs less than a trip to the arcade).  There are plenty of other players who are nice or at the very least don't care about other players enough to not bother them.  Look at it this way, because of what happened, you got to play the game for free. ||||| You only use up ToD tickets when you win a tour.  You're always gonna run into shitty people when playing online, that's just a (unfortunate) part of the game.  If I did have one critisim, it does sound like you're focusing a bit too much on damage as scout when your primary job is money grabbing. If you're getting all the money then keep up the good work. ||||| Oh, it's another one of these posts...  Meh ||||| sniper is a pick class in MVM and we all know pick classes go against the MVM meta. and ANY OTHER META that does not involve:   one demo   one heavy   one medic   one engineer   one scout  and a soldier will be DOOMED to fail and anyone who goes as a pick class MUST be kicked as they are the burden of the team.  seriously can the MVM community stop with this bullshit mindset?
4557	1,3,3	9	So, I guess I'll start by saying that I'm new here. I have considered myself a bit more of a feminine guy for quite some time, but it was only recently that I decided to search for a subreddit like this. I have lurked a bit, but not for too long and the only reason I hadn't made a post was due to being on alien blue, not pro, so I couldn't make a post. Anyway, here I am, now on to the core of the post.  So recently I was convinced by a friend of mine to make a tumblr. Now, I hate tumblr, I can honestly say that, but there is enough content that I like that I can enjoy having a tumblr. I should also state that I am a brony, for this plays a lot into my story. About 2 weeks ago or so I was on FimFiction (a site dedicated to MLP fanfiction) and I saw a story about a character named Glittershell. Through this fanfic I found the ask tumblr related to it, ask-glittershell. Glittershell is a crossdressing/transgender version of a character known as snails from the show. Along with this blog I found another one called Aero-replies, which tells the story of a young colt who enjoys crossdressing and how he develops, from how I see it now it may start dabbling into gender dysphoria. I have known about my enjoyment of crossdressing and admitted it to myself and my close friends for a couple years now, but I can show that I've enjoyed it through actions taken far beyond that. Possibly tracing back all the way to at least 6th grade, so around 5 or 6 years ago.   To quickly summarize all of those experiences oh so long ago, I lived in a different town during the summers with my mother, step father, sister, and step sister. My step sister was about 6 months older than me and around my height, although a bit heavier than me, but not much. Occasionally, when everyone was gone for an extended period of time, and she had left her laundry in the bathroom I would try on her clothes. It would start with something simple such as a shirt, and as time progressed, and I did it more and more, I would wear her underwear, pants, a bra, and 2 shirts or something that went together. I'm not quite sure what urged me to do all of it....but what I can say, is that I loved it to death. Skip to a few years later, and my mom and step dad divorced, but I was already barely living with her in that town, cuz I didn't know anyone there. Now, I didn't realize it, but since I no longer had a female in the house around my age and size, I wouldn't be able to cross dress at all. Skipping forward again, to when I rediscovered my cross dressing, it wasn't due to me actually cross dressing, and was instead more when I accepted that I was bi (however, now I identify as gay, for multiple reasons that I dont feel like getting into in this post), I can link these together for they both are things I had hidden deep within me from that first era of sexual experimentation when I had first gotten my computer in 6th grade. Once I had dug up one, the other followed not terribly long after. However, when I rediscovered it, I had simply thought it was a sexual fetishism I had. I would occasional cyber with this girl I knew, and I would occasionally ask to dress in something like a maid outfit, or a schoolgirl outfit or a sexy librarian, just different things. And that is all that cross dressing was for me, that is, until recently.  Back to now, I read through these two tumblr blogs as soon as I had the ability, due to my busy schedule, and they touched me deeply. I nearly cried at the part in Aero-Replies where he comes out about cross dressing to his mom and she tells him not to do it cuz its weird, but to protect him because she knew what its like to get picked on for who you are, and didn't want her son to come home, bullied and teased, battered and bruised, like she had. All of these blogs felt special to me, but I passed it off as I think that ponies and traps (cuz thats what they were at certain points) are freaking adorable, cuz they are, but i realized it was more than that when in a skype call with a friend of mine, we'll call him Paul. In this skype call, Paul and I were talking about these blogs, cuz I was really obsessed with them when reading them, and Paul remembered that his sister left her prom dress in his closet. So, following the nature of the topics at hand, he went to go get it, he found 2 other dresses as well. Then, over video call, he changed into them and sat in the call wearing them. At this point i was literally in physical pain, not because it was horrible to watch him do this, but because I couldn't cross dress as well. This was the defining moment when I realized how much I want to make crossdressing a more normal part of my life.  Be this as it may, I cannot simply transition into making it a normal part of my life for multiple reasons. One of the biggest is the issue of money. I'm in no way a rich person, I still wear some clothes that I got back in 8th grade because I haven't grown like at all since then. I'm about 6 foot and 120 lbs, and I've been that for around 4 or 5 years at this point. Another reason I cannot just jump into all of this is because I don't have the figure I want to have to complement the clothing I want to have. I am skinny, and can certainly be a more feminine guy at times, however, I am lacking a figure. I plan on working on doing stuff such as lunges and squats with weights to get an ass and some thighs, if you have any specific work out plans that work for you, that would be awesome. Finally, I would feel weird making this transition with my dad here. My father and I think very differently about a lot of things, however, he has always been supportive of me so long as I'm doing what makes me happy. I am 99% sure he would support me in doing this, so long as I'm doing something that I truly think is what I want to do, I'm just worried about the initial reaction. I've always been bad at telling my dad things like this about me, for instance it took me forever to tell my dad I was bi (I came out to him during that period, before I identified as gay), and his initial reaction was....less than stellar. However, now its not a big deal and my dad does not judge me for my choices, and if he does he does not voice these opinions, and I'd rather it stayed that way should that be the case. But telling my dad that I want to start buying womens clothing more, and wearing it, is a situation I do not want to put myself in, at least not for a while, till I'm very very convinced in my decision.  Now, this post has already been longer than I expected, however, there is one final thing I feel the need to touch on in this post. While this is something I've not been thinking about as much, I feel at times a bit of gender dysphoria. I have thought about it a bit, and I'm pretty sure that I am just a male who likes to cross dress. However, I think I could have a bit of gender fluidity, and I don't think I can 100% throw me being trans out of the equation just yet, it will require a lot more thought to determine this. I also want to start shaving more, my legs in particular, but I also need to be better about shaving areas such as my pubs to keep them from growing to the length they tend to reach. I blame that on laziness. So shaving techniques would be helpful as well.   I sorta just want opinions and ideas from people here. Maybe a little story of your own, a technique for shaving, or working out. Or maybe a place that you like to buy clothes, or a picture of yourself. Sorta free for all here. I just want help, and to be a part of this community in some way. Anyways, it is currently approaching 4 am here and I have work tomorrow. Sorry for the super long post  TL;DR: I'm new here, like crossdressing but can't do it because of money, figure, and parents. May have slight gender dysphoria. Talk about yourself, tips, clothes, makeup, or post pics of stuff. Have fun and shit. :3 ||||| Welcome to the club, ponipones! ||||| *checks for spy cameras in the bedroom*   Dam. Besides the divorced parents, the older sibling, and being gay . You kinda just  summed up that entire part of me.Wow.... But yea I'm also gender fluid usually in a feminine-masculine scale I'm usually a bit left of center(today was more right of center). used to think my crossdressing was a sexual fetish, currently shave my legs. Dam I really feel as if I just read about my self. And that pain, I have felt that pain before. Dysphoria is a bitch I can agree with you on that.

112	1,3,3,3,3,3	6	Hi Albuquerque!  I just got back from a family wedding in New Mexico a few minutes ago but unfortunately had an issue with our baggage.   We purchased a real cow skull to bring home but after some debate* we weren't allowed to even check the item and we had to leave it behind.  JetBlue is currently holding it in their baggage area for a week and said we could arrange for someone else to come pick it up.  My girlfriend has been obsessed with finding one of these for a while and she's really upset. Due to our current situations we can't even afford to ship it right now.  Is there anybody willing to pick it up from the airport and hold on to it for a while until I can scrape together the money to get it to New York? I don't know what else to do and this is a final effort to get Bessie home. (Yes we named it already.) it's packed really well in a box that's about 24x24x12"  Or if anyone has any other ideas?  *for anyone curious, we called the airline prior to even purchasing the skull and they verified it would be ok to check as long as it was bubble wrapped and packed in a flat-edge box but the attendants at the luggage check cited rules against "pet remains" as reasons for not taking it. This is still an open issue for us with their customer service.  EDIT: Wow I am blown away by how many people responded so quickly. I am at work now but will try to respond to everyone asap. You New Mexicans really are friendly as hell :) ||||| If no one does it today, I am off of work tomorrow morning and can swing by and pick it up after dropping of my son at school. ||||| I am free for most of this week and can also pick it up. Feel free to message me, if arrangements haven't already been made. :)  ||||| Looks like you have plenty of offers, but if they don't work out, shoot me a PM.  Also, you should have told them it was leftovers, not pet remains. ||||| I work near the airport.  PM me if you still need help.  CHEERS ||||| I am always by the airport. I used to work next to that office when I used to deliver lost luggage out of the airport. I can pick it up and hold it for you if you wish.

2284	1,3,3,3,0,2,3,3,3,2,3	34	There are honestly too many to collate and summarize but here is the thread where they started. [URL]  No proof but most of these smell legit to me. A couple things sound insane (eCaine and eMadrak in particular) but probably no worse than any of the top dogs in Mk2.   EDIT: the spoilers on 4chan were 100% accurate for cards in the minions insider article. These are real. ||||| I want to get excited for these leaks, but I also don't want to get my hopes up and risk getting trolled by some clever anon. ||||| According to the thread Storm Lances got a point of DEF and are now 10 mk II points. They're probably FA 2 now, so will be absolutely bonkers. Cygnar has ways to give both units arcane shield and apparently Stryker2 has deceleration (+2 ARM) so we can protect them from shooting on the approach.  I'm so glad Americans don't understand Storm Lances as their cries of underpowered probably led to this buffing of the best non-gunmage unit in Cygnar.  Things look good for Cygnar jacks and units. This is probably compensating for the toning down of Haley2 and (I suspect) the Black 13th. ||||| From the Troll spoilers there seemed to be very little negative stuff. While the stone got more expensive nearly all of our other stuff got cheaper and it feels like they're all appropriately costed (as in, costed for what they do without support and not the final version like how it feels in Mk2 sometimes).   eMadrak sounds like 3Butcher levels of nonsense now, and pGrissel and eGrissel also sound great. 3Doomy's feat nerf and loss of goad will hurt, but I think cheaper guys in general will make up for it (though anti-healing tech is scary because of how it circumvents the feat).   The biggest letdown is probably Kriel Warriors who, while way cheaper than Fenns, seem to be absolutely blown away by them. They lost the +2/+2 prayer but didn't get anything to compensate for it so they're still MAT5 POW10, and I don't think Unyielding makes up for it - especially since Cabers are MAT 5 P+S13. We learned from Mk2 post-nerf Warders that tarpits with little offense whatsoever are pretty sub-par over models that can actually clear a zone, and Fenns seem to do that job. The Kithkar even gives them +1 MAT which means they can potentially be MAT 9 with cleave for slightly cheaper than the full Fenn boat + FC package in Mk2. Seems like a no-brainer, especially with some new +DEF spells in-faction.   Mulg's nerf, on paper, is something I actually really like since he got  a huge point reduction. Getting the Despoiler's animus seems like an upgrade over Runebreaker, built-in pathfinder is nice and still MAT 7 means he's actually a really self-sufficient guy for 9.5 Mk2 points. Rok seems to be the new 'one round that colossal' guy and gaining an inch of reach is big for him.   Losing Far Strike seems to be hurting as much as I thought as the GK is neither gaining RNG nor is he actually ROF3 in Mk3.  ||||| Night troll and Madrak 2 is absolutely stupid of a combination. ||||| If you don't mind me asking, what is Mulg's new point cost?  ||||| Apparently Runeshapers are FA3 now :( guess I'm set for max FA in Unbound at least.  ||||| All these farrow spoilers make me very excited. Battle Boar has primal, Brigands have all their prayers active at once and 19 points for the Brigand+warlord package(warlord also has prey instead of Gang). War hog isn't a terrible khador heavy anymore. What a lovely day. ||||| I got to see a full set of Khador cards from a friend's friend as well. Quick summary: Everything is better, and also cheaper. I can't say if it's legit, but it sure looks like it. For instance, both Sorchas have an extra melee damage die against stationary targets. pSorcha's assassination just got a lot better :D ||||| So, I never go to 4chan, but I tried this time.. I saw no spoilers in that link, jsut people talking about them? is there an image file or text document somewhere? ||||| Geez guess they thought Kraye was too strong with new jack buffs. Lost two spells and his signature spells. Also don't see steady or parry. Main thing that's going to make his playable is 5" reposition on like the whole army

1281	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	Hey all. This is a question that has been plaguing me since I watched the trailer. What are your thoughts?  ||||| I'd be ecstatic, personally.  Most games that have optional female protagonists tend to treat male as the default character, including in any comic books or other media associated with the game.   I also wouldn't give any credit to rumors that they were removing the male player option, as opposed to the rumors that they've removed the female player option, where I've gotten a *little* bit concerned.   So I'd probably immediately reserve my copy of the game (where I've chosen to wait instead), and then run around the house screaming for about an hour... or maybe two. ||||| [deleted] ||||| I'd send them a fancy cake. Your move, Bethsoft. ||||| I'd be positively surprised. Doesn't take much in the way of media dissection to realise that would be a big change from what literally all other "choice of gender" games do or have done. ||||| Top be honest, they could have used a gender neutral character. There was no real need to include the voice. if instead they used a gender neutral jumpsuit and a helmet without voice it would be better for probably most people. since they could imagine the exact person they wanted under the helmet.  ||||| [empty] ||||| I'd think it was cool and it would surprise me. Nothing else really.  ||||| I probably wouldn't have any real reaction, since generally the leads of Fallout have no real set gender and the one in the trailer was likely a placeholder.  Honestly, I was almost convinced Dogmeat was the lead this time for a minute though. That would have been interesting. ||||| I'd celebrate, and then write Bethesda (probably through their facebook page) to thank them.  I maintain that they really missed a marketing opportunity with Skyrim in regards to the protagonist. They could have created so many options in race and made half of them female with the Dragonborn. They could easily do the same with the new protagonist. But who knows? Maybe they'll show us E3 stuff with only a female protag. They won't. But they *could.* ||||| Representation of ladies in media is always nice but the truth is that no matter who they put in the trailer, it's always going to feel alien to me because it won't be an accurate representation of the protagonist I want to play/create... so in the end it doesn't matter who the trailer protagonist is. ||||| I would be so happy, I always loved the fallout world and I've been playing a female protagonist since fallout 1 in '95, I would love to once more explore the wastes as someone I identify with!  ||||| Could you clarify? Are you asking what we'd say if there was the female version of that character in the trailer instead of a guy?   If so, I may not be a fan of Fallout (simply because I can't be arsed to play it), but I'd imagine most people would be indifferent. Bethesda's RPGs have a great deal of customization and have had so for quite a long time; I can't imagine that having a female character in the trailer would mean anything more than showcasing that fact.  I do hope, if it was female though, that she has as nice of a bum. Because that dude in the trailer's [got a good one.]([URL] ||||| Nothing. I really don't care either way. It's more Fallout. ||||| I'd think there is an actual playable female protag for main story, to the contrary of how info indicates from a while back.  ||||| I'd pre-order on the spot. ||||| I'd notice it. But I'd be indifferent about it. I want to play as a female, but that's because generally gender hasn't mattered in these games. But I don't play any game because it has a woman protagonist, I just play games I think look/are good. Either way, that would have been interesting! ||||| I would be super happy! I love seeing a more equal representation in video games...I heard a rumor though that there is no female option in the new FO4...that best not be the case! -_- ||||| It would have been nice if they'd pulled a Mass Effect 3 and just made 2 versions of the same trailer, then gone a step further and released both at the same time.  Thing is...I'm just happy we've got a trailer. Between making a trailer with a girl in it and focusing more on the game, I'd rather they polished the game to perfection than waste time on advertising for a game that is obviously going to sell like hot sweetrolls. Obviously there's going to be a female protagonist option. They can't not include it, and if they're really going the voiced protagonist option, limitations there are no longer an excuse, what with all the effort Bioware have gone to in voicing both sexes in all their games (at least, the ones I've played. Dragon Age Inquisition even had a choice of female voices (and maybe more for the male. I don't know. I haven't bothered looking)), and even if Bioware has the backing of EA, they also have their limitations. Bethesda has cash, and it's all their own; they're the ones who determine their limitations.   But yeah, you almost certainly get a female protagonist. She's either in the crib (if you're the baby) or looking down at said baby. I can't see Bethesda pulling such a massive 180 on something that has been a part of their schitck since time immemorial (the 90s?).  That said, it's bloody annoying how the current climate of gaming culture alienates women so much by using the machismo to promote, and the option of the female to point out that, hey, you could do that too, but you were already going to buy the game, weren't you? ||||| Compelte indifference.

4428	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	21	[empty] ||||| 12 years plus kindergarten means most people are around 18 when they graduate and at that age you are legally considered an adult at least in the US.  ||||| [deleted] ||||| It really depends on what you mean by "school", but the answer is likely 'tradition' as much as anything else.   By the time they graduated from the secondary school system back in the late 1800's and early 1900's when the school system in general was becoming entrenched, the students would be 17 or so.   That was a good age to separate them into three types: those who were going to start working as labourers or apprentices in professions like farming or construction or manufacturing line assembly and were physically developed enough to handle that work, and those who were going to continue their education in colleges or universities, and those who stayed at home as home-makers and didn't pursue either further education or work-life career at that time.   That age very generally give you the right mix of scholastic experience to move into any of those next stages of life with enough knowledge to get along. Since the system tried to be efficient, it applied the same standard to everyone. Since all students that graduated grade 12 had a fairly consistent curriculum under their belt, you had a predictable starting point for whatever came next.  FYI it's not everywhere. Ontario in Canada had a Grade 13 for quite some time.  ||||| 1) In the US it is not 12 years, but 13 that is standard. You forgot about Kindergarten. It is also not set in stone because there are two more years of optional head start that can be taken before Kindergarten bringing the number of years up to 15.   2) It is also not set in stone because you can fail grades and increase the amount of schooling you will have, and you can test out of grades getting out early. It is uncommon but not exactly rare to be able to start going to University at age 15 if you are highly intelligent, and skipping one year and going at 17 is very common.   As to why it is set to 13 years on average. That is because we have determined that 18 is the year of majority and you are required to be in school from age 5 till then, with some states allowing you to drop out at 16.  ||||| Many systems in the US aren't 12 years.  Montessori--for example--includes a pre-Kindergarten year for a total of 14 years.  Many private school systems and home schooling can vary as well.  It all started with one model because public education for the non-wealthy is a pretty new idea in the world and the first systems were standardized.  Most people who were lucky enough to attend school prior to WWII only completed 8th grade, not 12th. Overall a standard model allows standard testing, standard books, standard class planning, and standard college expectations. It could have ended up as an 11 or 13 year standard as easily as 12.     ||||| In the UK it's 14 years from 4-18 (although entry can be deferred until age 5), provided that you consider for "Reception" (Kindergarten) year from 4-5 as an actual academic year. The first year is spent with "Early Years" teachers who are there to promote cognitive development and social skills ready for more structured learning in Year 1. This helps in dealing with sheltered young children who are never sent to nursery/preschool prior to attending.   Increasingly this year is becoming essential for promoting English language acquisition in children from immigrant families, as they often hear English for the first time when they start attending school and will need to learn it from scratch. Most can speak a comprehensible amount of English by the end of the year because they learn via immersion, and will never be spoken to in their home language at school.  A degree of disdain for other schooling systems can be seen in the way our Tertiary education is structured. Degrees in the UK are often 3 years long, and do not incorporate a period of general education as American courses seem to. The perception is that all meaningful general education will be completed prior to age 18. Despite this, general education courses are recommended or sometimes mandatory for international students from certain foreign countries, as they often lack the variety of qualifications that a British student would require to enter. I knew them as "foundation years", and they usually ended with the student selecting a degree scheme (major) to proceed with for 3 further years. From this I gathered the notion that 12 years is not enough - the time allowed for study essentially delays the entire education process right into University. You may disagree, but that's my assessment of the American/British school interplay.  The mandatory minimum leaving age was only recently (in the past decade) raised to 18, and was 16 previously. People can still attend "college" (doesn't strictly mean the same thing as in American English) and learn specialised skills from 16-18 if they choose to. I would say the British system is different in many respects from the US one, so it's difficult to anticipate and list all the ways in which the two systems are distinct.  ||||| I wouldn't say it's "set-in-stone" as there are plenty of more advanced students that skip grades or take extra courses to graduate early from high-school. ||||| European schools are different. They go longer. They could have a different grade system.  The Germans sent their children to kindergarten. We took a page fro their book and instituted here in the U.S. a long time ago.  The Swiss have a shorter time in school. They have a law that boys must join the military at 17.  ||||| In the US people don't realize that you can get your GED as young as 16 and go to college, or even younger if you manage an interview with the Dean or suchlike. Or you can challenge classes at high school and graduate early, or even just do home schooling at your own pace and graduate early that way as well. ||||| College/university represents a big step in your life as that is your first real glimpse at independence from your parents. After 12 years of school, most people are 18, or will be soon. That's the age you're legally an adult and considered capable of taking care of yourself  ||||| In Ireland, we spend 14 years in school. Primary School is 8 years, and secondary school is 6 years. Most start at the age of 4, and leave at the age of 18. So it isn't set in stone or anything, it just depends on the countries legal school requirements ||||| [empty]
3509	1,3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3	16	Hey!  I just scored a tin of Papas from CBid and oddly enough, they do not have the pig tail like you see everywhere.  Instead, they are all pre-punched, like 7 or 9mm.  Has anyone else heard of pre-punching cigars before distribution?  Sure, it makes it convenient like a cigarette, just pull out of the tin and light up, but it seems off to me.  Did someone just re-cello and send me used/altered cigars? ||||| Maybe a Godzilla sized beetle?  Seriously though, never heard of this but I'd definitely contact Cbid.  Edit: I bet you were looking forward to biting those little piggy tails off huh? ;-) ||||| I would definitely put a call into cbid.  ||||| Could you post a pic? ||||| All four are like that? No pig tail parts in the cello?  ||||| If the pig tails broke, then there would be a hole left behind. That may be what you are seeing. ||||| I've had 3 tins, never seen that before. ||||| So on further inspection, it does appear that the tails just turned to dust at some point in their cellophane life.  I say dust, because thats pretty much what it is.  One of the 4 has like a 1/16" of a tail so I'm pretty sure that what it is.  Thanks for all the help y'all!  I'm still a little dismayed at their arrival condition, but I guess I'll just start ordering elsewhere from now on.  Laters! :) ||||| Yea, that's very odd. I'm assuming the pig tails broke, leaving what looked like a punch hole. Shoot me some pictures via PM and I'll check it out.
3491	1,3,3,3,3	6	I am looking in to getting my first Chinchilla and have been doing a lot of research on their care, and the thing that keeps coming up is that they do not like heat very much. Now my problem is that I live in Spain and its gets up to 40+ C in summer, the house stays a lot cooler and we have air con in a couple of rooms but I am still concerned about the heat. Chins are very easily available in Spain, much more than the UK, do you think they might have adapted slightly and be used to higher temperatures or I am going to struggle to keep her cool enough? ||||| Thanks for the advice.  In Spain the heat is a dry heat which makes it a bit more comfortable.  I think the best thing to do is to see how hot the house gets this summer, get a thermometer to check the temperature in the different rooms and see if it stays cool enough. There is no way I would want to put one in danger of heat stroke because I didn't do my homework properly.  ||||| I live in Southern California where it can get to 110f in the summer or higher and is also a dry heat. I had a chin and at the time we did not have air conditioning and he did just fine. I bought a slab of granite which you can put in your freezer then place it in the cage with your chin.

6408	1,3,3,3,3	12	I was just thinking about the 3rd rounder traded to Miami for a 3rd and 4th next year (and 6 this year, damn). I just think that it makes WAY too much sense that with adding those picks we would trade up in next year's draft. What would our pressing needs be? Well, Adrian is going to be 31 then and costing us around 18 MILLION. Plus, we did not plan ahead for this year by drafting a power/replacement running back to groom. I think that with the picks acquired, it would be a fantastic idea to use them to trade up in round 1 and get who is supposed to be the next Adrian Peterson, Leonard Fournette. What do you all think about this idea? ||||| Fournette is probably going to be a very high pick.. so probably not him. It'll cost too much to trade up (**FROM 32**) I think. There are some other good RBs next year like Chubb.  I think it's more likely that Spielman will use the extra ammo to  trade back into the 1st if someone he likes is still on the board.    ||||| There are some elite running back prospects coming out next year...   There were a few people upset we traded our third because they wanted instant gratification, but it was a great trade for us.    ||||| Or a left tackle, and go with McKinnon plus maybe a later RB.  Depends on how free agency goes next year ||||| Kinda wish we'd have traded down our 1st too but yeah, this trade helps set us up great next year. We don't have much roster room now but next year things will really shake out and we'll see where we need to go.  My thought is we use the ammo to get 3 picks in the 1st and 2nd rounds to likely draft RB, LT, and TE (unless we love Pruitt and TJ's development this year)..   Kalil is likely gone since we chose to overpay him instead of extending. AD I have no idea but we're not going to pay him that much and it's *the draft* to look at RB. We wait every year for Rudy to breakout but I don't see him justifying his contract and he can be cut after this year with minimal cap hit.   No way we're getting Fournette though, it'd cost us way too much but that's okay, there's plenty of top talent to pair with McKinnon.

4523	1,3,1,3,3	12	(First, a disclaimer: This is the first post on here I've ever made, so I sincerely apologize if I completely screwed up with the "reddiquette")  I have noticed that a lot of fat-acceptance folks use images of The Birth Of Venus, the Venus de Milo, and some other famous Boticelli painting to show how larger women are actually beautiful. However, I myself have a similar body type to the subjects of those paintings, and they would tell me I have thin privilege. Titp even posted something saying specifically that women who are a size 6/8 (my size) have it much easier than them. However, the women in these painting that they use images of are probably a size 6/8.   The link: ([URL]  I just thought this seemed like a silly and somewhat hypocritical double standard.  ||||| [I can't repost this enough.]([URL] ||||| You're right. The examples they use to try to prove that fat women used to be considered beautiful usually include women who are overweight at most--almost never obese. ||||| can't link TiTP. Screenshots. ||||| It's because the "idealized" woman at the time was bigger than our current "idealized" (ie, models). Also the logic is that the idealized image was larger than the average woman, and now it's reversed. What they don't realize though is that hugely obese people back then where very rare and were ridiculed (just like super-skinnies now sometimes are). There are a couple of tales of men who got really fat and killed their horses from exhaustion. And these men weren't admired and respected.   In terms of attractiness, for woman, the ideal has always been healthy with obvious signs of fertility (REAL curves: hips and breasts) and for men, health and vitality.

Apparently it is not common knowledge.    Particularly since the transition to digital, there are no longer "attached" previews on a movie.  Certain theatre chains may mandate that their trailer placement be uniform throughout the company, but the studios do not dictate (if they ever did) whether Godzilla plays with 300 or not.    At my theatre, we play 2 previews before each feature.  I've been to, and heard of, some places that play 20-30 minutes of previews before the film the customer paid to see starts.  For me, that's way too many previews.  I like our system: 2 previews, total of 5 minutes, and then it's showtime. ||||| I was dragged to 300, the Godzilla trailer was the best part. ||||| (In the UK) Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

8226	1,3,3,3	4	I've been reading the first book in the series and the exposition is not at all subtle. The way Annabeth will always inform the reader about Greek myth, instead of finding a more subtle way to weave this into the fabric of the story, feels like a desperate attempt for the series to be seen as educational.

I've read American Gods btw ||||| Same age group, but much more detailed in the mythology gives you **Orphans of Chaos** by John C. Wright.

5193	1,3,3	6	Hello.  Just got a pair of Sony MDRZX770BN. I got them because they offer both noise cancelling and B-T audio. I plan to use them strictly for travel -- planes, etc. I have a pair of Audio Technicas I use in the home for "real" listening sessions.  Problem is, it seems that when I have the NC on and I have them connected over B-T, I can hear this high pitched squeal.If you've ever had a bout of tinnitus, it basically sounds like that.  I don't know if it's a defect with the particular pair, or if it's just a side effect of the various technologies involved.  Anyone have any insight? Alternatively, can anyone vouch for an alternative pair of cans with both NC and Bluetooth? I really like the Bose QC, but they don't offer B-T. Walking around an airport, picking up bags, etc. that cord can get in the way. The only other option I saw was the Samsung Level series, but the reviews have seemed pretty lackluster.  Thanks. ||||| I own these headphones. There is no high pitched squeal with NC on. The typical NC "hiss" is almost completely absent with these Sony's as well, you probably have a defective pair. ||||| That's just what it is. If your ears are sensitive enough you could be annoyed by it. My gf uses my Momentum Wireless at work when she needs to focus on huge spreadsheets and she has very sensitive ears (better hearing than I). I can hear it as well but not the extent she can.  Basically ANC produces sound waves opposite of the external sound waves excluding the sound that the headphones produce. So that's what you are hearing, it's more evident if you don't have anything playing in the headphones and it is mostly quiet around you.
1655	1,2,3	7	About a month ago, I had new tyres fitted and got the wheels balanced - everything was great, felt very stable at any speed. [10 days after that]([URL] I took a nail to the rear, removed the rear wheel and took it in to the shop to get it plugged and patched. According to my receipt, it was balanced again.   I went for a long ride yesterday and everything felt perfectly fine until I ended up getting on the motorway to get home as quickly as possible. As I was smashing it down the motorway at **exactly** 70mph, I felt unstable. I'm not entirely sure how to describe the feeling. I'm not saying I was waving all over the place, but I just didn't feel stable at the rear. Is it at all possible that because the wheels weren't balanced together that the rear isn't properly equipped for high speeds? Should I take the bike in to get both wheels rebalanced?  ||||| since it was patched, have you checked the pressure?  I find even just a couple of PSI down on the rear feels 'orrid. ||||| The wheel will be balanced - in that, it will have no rotational instability while turning - however, was it in alignment with the front wheel?  If they're not in alignment, you'll feel a slight pull to a direction. Like you're fighting a bit with it to stay straight.   If it's only slight, it'll be higher speeds before you really start to notice it.   It's easy enough to fix, fortunately - just make sure that you measure correctly.

If 2 doesn't work then turn down since graphics, maybe your build can't handle something. 4.

The host then proceeded to say that Hillary is literally the ONLY possible candidate for the democrats except Joe Biden who as of now ISN'T EVEN RUNNING.

Not only have we seen about 20 of these topics over the last couple days, but it's also a borderline violation of rule #3 of the [posting guidelines]([URL]      It's a bit too meta to be related directly to Dark Souls, instead, it's about how some random people online are tagging the game. Though it's through a platform where you can purchase the game, it's really not much more appropriate than taking random screenshots of other loose online references to Dark Souls, which is exactly what rule #3 is in place for. There's no real discussion coming from this either, the typical responses are "fkn casul faget" and "Git gud u casul"... or people pointing out that "casual" is spelled wrong... every time this is posted.      The other aspect is that we're not fond of encouraging trolling or abusing other online systems. I realize that tagging Dark Souls as casual through steam is *very* innocuous, and I would agree with the sentiment that Steam's system probably invited this response. However, we don't like r/darksouls being a homebase to organize raids or anything like that. Undoubtedly, some people seeing this will jump on the steam, joke-tagging bandwagon.

4533	1,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3	22	Once upon a time I'd stumbled across a link that showed information on breakpoints for AE storage disks based on the size of the disk and the number of items you're storing. I cannot find this link anymore and I was wondering if somebody could help me.  At what point is it better to preformat a disk and use it exclusively for one item versus throwing anything and everything into a disk? ||||| By far, the biggest advantage from preformatted disks is when using multiple disks on a network.  The problem with multiple unformatted disks is that AE's storage can become "fragmented" across disks.  ~~In other words, if you put three stacks of cobble into a system with two unformatted disks, you only have a 25% chance of all three ending up on the same disk.  And because AE only allows 63 item types per disk, it causes the system to be able to hold fewer item types overall (because cobble is now counting as two).~~ (This doesn't seem to be strictly true; see MissApocalycious' comment below for further discussion.)  My rule of thumb: if you have more than one stack of something, add it to a disk's preformatting.  (AFAIK, one stack can't ever be split across disks.)  Adding a new item to a disk is easy, as you don't need to empty it first.  Once a disk has all 63 types used up, it's time for a new disk.  I tend to put all my "bulk" items (cobble/dirt/sand/gravel, copper/iron/tin, seeds, etc.) on one, larger disk (larger disks hold more *stacks*, but not more *types*) and use the smallest disks for everything else — I run out of types far more often than I run out of bytes. ||||| I don't see much benefit in it. It satisfies the urge of some people to apply physical sorting on a system whose main feature is that it doesn't need physical sorting in the first place.  If all your disks are clogged with cobble it isn't a sign you need to pre-format, it is a sign you need to pre-sort. It takes a lot less effort/planning to put a diamond pipe and a void pipe at a key chokepoint than it does to preformat a lot of disks.  Instead of putting all that junk into AE, dump the junk first. Use level emitter setups to maintain what you need of bulk items.  Then just survey your disks now and then. If you have a high capacity disk whose every slot has low capacity items pull it, drop it into a chest, pull out one or more low capacity items and drop in some of your bulk stuff. Then stick it in a higher priority Drive.  At the end of the day all the effort that goes into pre-formatting may not yield much in the way of practical results. There are plenty of other areas you can spend your time that will yield better results. ||||| I started out with unformatted disks. The system just stored items randomly in the disks but they quickly got filled. I wondered why and started to do some research and testing. Now, for example you can store 63 types of items or 4160-8128 stacks of items on a 64k disk. The amount of stacks you can put on your disk depends on the amount of item types you got stored on it. With 63 different types of items it will be 4160 stacks and with only one item type it will be 8128 stacks. So I guess you could preformat a disk for cobblestone, one for stuff that you get from your farms if you have a lot of tree farms set up or something. To summarize: Preformatting saves space if you make a couple of disks for specific items that you have a lot of. ||||| Was it this link?   [URL]     Other than this I have nothing else to contribute to your post, just learning AE myself, sorry =x   ||||| I didn't even bother when i started with AE just a short while ago. So far so good. I just use disk arrays with big enough storage modules to suit my needs.  ||||| I use a preformatted drive to store all the stuff from my quarry (ores, gems, etc) but nothing else. ||||| Initially you don't have to but as you advance to the point where you can afford to build multiple drives and amassing item quantities into the thousands you'll want to start formatting.  The sooner you start formatting the less defragging you'll have to do later on (if you care about space optimization).   ||||| If you are using it for one item you are better off using a barrel or deep storage or quantum tank and attach a storage bus. Then you don't have to worry about space especially with a quantum tank. I do this for cobble, dirt, sand, gravel, and obsidian. ||||| There really is no reason, it's just an organisational thing. If you're going to be using ME chests, regularly changing disks out or sorting the access terminal by the 'cell priority' option, then go ahead and preformat to make things easier. But if you're just throwing everything into a storage bus, there's really no need.

Doing this will reset the progression on them, however.  The only reason someone would actually **WANT** to upgrade a lvl 32 piece with Xûr would be for a piece of armor (and only armor) that has a better stat roll. But it's an expensive endeavor for limited gains, so usually only done by people with plenty of resources. ||||| I upgraded mine a few weeks ago even though I had the 36 light helm.

The first thing that caught my attention was the lack of better lands. I was surprised to not see Fetid Heath in there.

How would you change it to make it more competitive with higher tier decks? Open discussion about the deck is welcome here, of course. ||||| I'd put in 4 Godless Shrine over the 4 Cave of Koilos. I can understand them adding City of Brass, but Cave just sounds absolutely terrible, and no Modern deck that I know of runs any of the painlands. Plus, Godless Shrine actually synergizes with the 4 Isolated Chapel they put in, which is, you know, kind of important? ||||| Personally,   -2 Windbrisk Heights (4 is too many)  -2 Caves of Koilos (Painlands are bad for this type of deck)  -2 City of Brass (Same as above, except Caves can tap for colourless and not burn you)  -2 Shrine of Loyal Legions (Too slow)  -2 Soul Warden (They're not bad, but they're not great if you're not dedicated to lifegain like Sisters is)  +4 Godless Shrine (Synergy with Isolated Chapel, fixes your mana way better)  +1 Vault of the Archangel (It's surprisingly good in this deck)  +1 Path to Exile (4 is better than 3)  +2 Inquisition of Kozilek   +2 Thoughtseize (more disruption is always better)  I'd also consider adding a one-off Sorin, Lord of Innistrad. His abilities are all relevant to this kind of deck. ||||| The most obvious parallel is (I think) [Soul Sisters]([URL] The linked forum thread includes a rundown of cards to run, how to run the deck, and pretty much everything you need to know about the deck.  The other upgrade path is [WB Tokens]([URL] (Again, link includes far more information than I have for you)  I'd recommend picking one of the two and then working towards acquiring the key pieces that aren't already in the deck. ||||| I'd work to go up in quantity on some cards.  Path should be 4x and inquisition/thoughtseize would be good at a 3/3 split.  Aside from that, the lands mentioned are also a great place to start.  ||||| I'd look at adding in a Sorin - Lord of Inistrad, sorting out the Landbase, cranking up some of those cards to 4 ofs ||||| 4 IOK or 3 IOK, x thoughtseize, if not one marsh flats, then at least 2 fetid heaths.  Maybe a ranger of eos (lack of creatures makes it probably better that they didn't include ranger).

Care to help a newby out?  is r/languagelearning a good place for this post? I guess i'm looking for some skype conversational partners!

That being said, one of the better books I've seen is "Teach Yourself Hindi" by Rupert Snell. He's one of the most recognized Hindi professors in the US, and the book is pretty thorough. There is also "Teach Yourself Urdu" by David Matthews which I have perused and it does it's job. You can always learn Urdu as well since they're nearly identical when spoken at a vernacular level, although being able to read Hindi while in India is more useful than being able to read Urdu.   Having been in India, I would say the most useful things at the basic level are greetings and numbers for costs of things. Also how to say "I am going to ____" and things like yes/no and that's good/bad. Most rickshaw drivers I've come in contact with know numbers in English but it can be helpful to know them in Hindi. Usually I can get through most situations with basic Hindi and basic English combined if I don't know all the Hindi words.   I am not a native Hindi speaker, but have been studying Hindi/Urdu for 3+ years. I'm not fantastic at it so I'm not the best person to ask although I can get by.  ||||| Head over to /r/india and ask there. I would have helped, but my Hindi is sub-optimal.
8331	1,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	Made my first character and got it to lvl 11. Queued for flashpoint as the quest said. Got to the first conversation and as I was watching it everyone kept spamming "spacebar" or "press spacebar". At first I was doing it, but I wanted to see the conversations, being my first character. Ended up getting vote kicked. "This could've been avoided" was what guy said before i left.  Is this something I should look forward to in the future, or is this more of a low level flashpoint affair?  EDIT: Thanks for the kind words and advice, guys! I'll let people know next time right from the get-go that it's my first toon. ||||| Most people have been through it more than once, but I've found that if you tell them it is your first toon and want to watch they will be understanding.  And if they aren't, well, they really are not the kind of people I would like to play with. ||||| I suggest playing a tank, they won't vote kick you then unless they enjoy sitting in queue for 30 mins :) ||||| Which server?  It is common understanding to skip cutscene on hard mode  But that's rude to demand the group to skip cutscene on story mode. Unfortunately that's the system in place to allow this negative social behaviour.  ||||| Just tell them you are new and it's your first run there. I've not seen a group force skipping at low levels if you tell them that at the start. ||||| I am also on Jung Ma. Talk to the Sith inquisition. Or message Iceshot. Tell them Lekka sent you along.  :) we are a pretty fun guild IMO. Plus we always a running low levels through. So many alt toons! ||||| Hey there, first off, let me say Im sorry you had that kind of experience with your flashpoint. Sadly you will find people like that in every game and SWTOR is no different. I would hope that you will see that the whole community is not like that at all. I have experienced that same situation before. I have a few suggestions that may help in the future. Were I on your server I would gladly help you get groups to run them with. I will say that while some players act like that, not all do.   My suggestions:  1. join a guild- generally i have found most guildies are happy to help run through flashpoint. Just let them know you want to experience the story  2. if you pug a fp, before you start it tell them it your first time and that you want to see the story. if they object you can leave the group or spacebar it.   3. dont say anything at all. the other players have no way of knowing who isnt spacebaring it. the screen just says "waiting for group" or something like that. ignore the chat box, let them rage. You enjoy the story. they may ragequit or something like that though.   4. this is what I did- wait. I skipped the flashpoints until I was at least level 50. then I went back and soloed the flashpoint. I was able to take my time, watch the cutscenes, enjoy the story etc. I think the only flashpoint that you cant solo is Colicid war games. At level 50 with decent gear and decently geared companion they are a piece of cake. Gear that drops that has mods in it can be sent to alts for helping them gear as they level.   Oh and if you run into players like that who rage at you, if you add them to your ignore list, you will not ever get put in a flashpoint or ops with them via the group finder again.   I wish you the best of luck! Dont get discouraged! ||||| I'm currently on a break but when I played flashpoints people would usually ask. "Skip?" I think it's better to ask if it's the 1st time for someone because people will agree to skip conversations -even if it's their 1st time- just to be accommodating and not look like "the new guy". Especially in later flashpoints.  Red eclipse. ||||| This is a rarity.  Just say its your first time and you want to see the story.  Most people are fine with letting you go through it.  Jerks aren't the norm in this game. ||||| I think you were the victim of bad etiquette.  If you are running story mode, people should not mind someone watching the cut scenes unless you joined a group looking for a "speed run" or a "social point farming run."   Conversely, watching cut scenes in hard mode is bad form unless you ask for and receive permission in advance.  At 55 you should be able to solo most of the flashpoints in story mode, so if you want to watch the cutscenes do that instead.  ||||| surprised people so gnarly at the game are even queued for the level 10 FP.  ||||| This is a really weird behavior and is really uncommon, as everyone said. They were probably on a premade group and got you in queue with then, or you're not telling us the entire story. I'd recommend you to get their name and report the situation to Bioware. The votekick function is for people that go afk or for people that are toxic to play with. In a game that is called "A story-driven mmo" by it's own company you should totaly have the right to watch the story, no matter how many times the other people on your team did it. ||||| I've never seen a kick vote for non-spacebar use. That sucks it happened to you.   A lot of the FPs are connected ( [URL] ) and have a story arc, spacing through it misses a lot. And as said below/above, if they want to kick you for not spacing through, put them all on ignore so you never get grouped with those morons again.  in HM FPs though, it's pretty expected that you've been through SM a number of times and should just space through it. ||||| Something I find that helps is using subtitles. If I wanna watch the cut scenes to know what's going on, I read faster than they can speak, and move on with space bar after I've read it, unless I actually want to hear the dialogue spoken (usually my characters lines). Some cut scenes can be REALLY long if you let them play, but accelerating it can help. But like others have said, kicking you because you want to enjoy the role playing element of a role playing game is just shitty ||||| I only get annoyed when it is on flashpoints that I know everyone has done and that I have done multiple times that day. If it is someone's first time then I don't mind them watching all the scenes though.  |||||  Dont know what server you play on, but I've noticed that on mine in Europe people are quite ok with waiting for someone to watch it, you have to assume this could happen when you are queuing for a flashpoint. It's a maturity thing. I think that you are absolutely right and entitled to watch and should not cave to that pressure. If they want a fast run let them queue with guildmates. ||||| That's awful and I'm sorry it happened to you! Demands for spacebarring aren't uncommon on the Jedi Covenant where I am, especially during Black Talon/Esseles, but that doesn't make it okay--and kicking somebody who wants to watch the cutscenes is ridiculous. I say this as someone who has done all the flashpoints more times than I can count and personally STRONGLY prefer to spacebar--nevertheless, I would never ever demand that someone spacebar through dialogue, especially if it's their first time. Fortunately, I wouldn't say that getting kicked for not spacebarring is common--never seen it happen myself--and I hope this doesn't discourage you from continuing to do flashpoints. Sounds like you just got super unlucky in that you got stuck with three assholes on your first group. SWTOR is my first MMO, but on the whole the community is far, far more pleasant than I ever expected, and I meet far more chill players than jerks! Definitely recommend putting those three on your ignore list so you don't have to deal with them in the future. ||||| When you start a flashpoint, let folks know that it is your first run and that you'd like to listen to the conversations.  Better for everyone to sort things out early. ||||| I would have "reported" every one of those players.  ||||| Unfortunately, yes.  Most of the people have seen the storyline stuff a ton of times (that's the downside to a cinematic/storyline game like this) - they just want to rocket through so they can get gear.  You should really join a guild and see about getting those that don't mind going through the motions in the instances.    Personally, I don't mind sitting through the storyline stuff because I figure someone is new at the game and wants to see what's what. ||||| Like other people said, all it usually (keyword) only takes telling the group it's your first time and you would like the see the scenes. If there's no communication, you will look like a retard. What I mean by that is every so often you'll get someone in your group that no matter everyone else tells them, they completely ignore them and give zero verbal feedback. If somebody says "press spacebar please" and no one raises an objection, then people get mad because they are staring at a frozen scene for 30 seconds because one person didn't skip. The real kicker is that I've had people that didn't even choose a dialog option.   Of course that's just assuming you didn't explain your situation and were just off in your own little world. If you did tell them, then they are assholes.  ||||| [empty] ||||| Turn on subtitles. That way you can read ahead and spacebar when done. It's usually an acceptable middle ground. Alternatively don't own up to not spacebarring. No one can tell who it is. ||||| Ignore those people, just tell them, (when you get to the FP) First time here, I am WATCHING the cutscenes. If they can't handle it, leave the group, /ignore the characters, requeue.  Helps if you queue as a healer or tank because you'll get a new group real fast and they might be left hanging. ||||| IMO, story mode is for story.  If you wanna watch i will be irritated because i have seen them all a million times, but i understand... it's what SM is for.  In HM, spacebar or gtfo. ||||| The first FP is BRUTAL with the talky talk. It's like 15 minutes if you spacebar the whole think and at least 45 minutes if you listen to it

4419	1,3,3,3	4	If we've only drug 12km it seems that we're jumping the gun here. Is there something I'm missing? ||||| Imagine I put a very strong magnet in a box. My brother comes along with several smaller magnets, and he notices how they are repelled from and attracted to the box. He concludes the box contains a strong magnet, without having to open it.   Basically, there are ways of learning properties of the earth's insides without needing to drill into it. The magnetic properties were first identified a long time ago (the magnetic compass is over 2000 years old). We can look at how other planets and other bodies in space move in relation to the earth to determine how earth's gravity is pulling on them. We use that to determine the mass of the earth. We can examine erupting volcanoes to learn properties of the earth's mantle. Using the mass and size of the earth we can make calculations about its density. We know the density of iron, and that it has magnetic properties. There's more stuff we can learn from how earthquakes propagate. There are a lot of things to learn that don't require any sort of drilling. ||||| There is an interesting article [here]([URL] but this is the upshot:  We know the mass of the Earth based on its gravitational effects on everything around it. We know that the center must be far more dense than it is up here, because we know the density of the crust and it's lower than the average density of the planet.  So, the center must be very dense metals, likely iron because there's so much iron in the universe. Also, our planet's magnetic field is strong evidence of a molten core. ||||| Earthquakes... By measuring how the shockwave of an earthquake travels through the earth, and recording it all over the globe, we can get a very precise picture of what's inside the earth. Similar to the way you rap your knuckle on something to see if its empty, but with a lot more math involved.
4740	1,3,3,3,3	7	So just picked up my Nano QX fpv from a local hobby shop after being out of stock for months. Anyways was flying great and having fun inside since it got dark out. Had a small crash into the wall from about 3 feet up just clipped it and landed on the top. The antenna is fine and so is everything else. Only thing is that now all I get is black and white video. Tried my fpv 250 to make sure it wasn't my fatshark goggles. Also changed channels still black and white. Even refocused the camera. Now it was inside and was seeing that in low light it has trouble adjusting to dark areas of the room. I stuck it under a lamp and still clear just black and white.   Do you think I did something to the vtx/ antenna? Or more of issue with the low light conditions?  ||||| I've gone through a LOT of crashes with the spektrum micro fpv cam (same one as in the nano qx fpv I think) and the antenna was heavily bent etc, but it never lost color.

How do should I work out in order to keep up with the cardio and not over strain myself? ||||| As universally unhelpful as this comment is, it depends. Everyone has a different training capacity. Try a plan and if you feel fatigue, cut back until you are getting enough rest. Personally, as a triathlete with a lifting background, i wouldn't hit the same muscle group more than twice a week (except abs and calves). ||||| The winter is actually a pretty good time to really add some leg strength for the next tri season. Good off season work (leg work + cardio) will give you a huge advantage when you start training more heavily in the Spring.  My schedule is:  * Monday AM - Legs, chest, triceps, ant. shoulders, trunk * Monday PM - Bike (trainer or spin class) * Tuesday AM - Run (tempo/speed work) * Tuesday PM - Swim * Wednesday AM - Legs, back, biceps, lat. shoulders, trunk * Wednesday PM - Bike (trainer or spin class) * Thursday AM - Run * Thursday PM - Swim * Friday - Off * Saturday - Long run * Sunday - Long bike (road or trainer)  Around February, I'll probably back off to one day in the weight room for a full body lifting day and add in one more run, bike, and swim per week.  To answer your question though, you may not overtrain yourself now, but if you want your main focus to be competing in triathlons in the summer, you'll probably have to shift your workouts to support that (more running, biking, and swimming), rather than lifting as much.  ||||| I'm a pretty seasoned lifter (3 years of Olympic lifts), and I stick with a simple routine like Starting Strength. Squats/Bench/Pull-ups on Day A, Squats/Press/Deadlifts on Day B. lift every other day, alternating routines. ||||| I'm going through the same transition myself. Went down to a 2 day a week routine, a push day and a pull day. Threw out leg exercises since I feel like I'm getting plenty from running/biking. So basically Monday: Push, Wed: Pull, Fri: Swim. T,R,Sat combination of biking and/or running (which I do light on weight days) with Sunday being rest day.  ||||| When I was a week out from Ironman I was kicking myself for not lifting enough.

Is it worth it? Please tell me that it's worth it!  * **Thalnos:** I hear a lot of good things about this baby, but it's basically a Kobold + Loot Hoarder in one card... It's like a permanent card advantage IF your deck runs Kobold + Loot Hoarder since replaces 2 slots for 1  * **Nozdormu:** So much fun, I'd like to have one but I fear that it's not competitive at all...  * **Edwin VanCleef:** I heard it was nerfed, is it worth it? Looks like a buff Questing Adventurer  * **Hogger:** So badass, so thug, but 4/4 for 6 is kinda lame and 2/2 taunts are vulnerable to every single area spell  * **Leeroy Jenkins:** Looks cool, I like the idea of a decent charge but it's basically a Fireball  * **Illidan Stormrage:** His ability is nice but at so low health I fear that he is going to get killed very fast, if not immediately  * **Malygos:** Very nice, decent attack and good health but unfortunately too heavy, sitting at 9 mana  * **Cairne Bloodhoof:** Nice stats but at 6 mana, and vulnerability to silence/poly/hex seems too risky. Thoughts?  * Other legendaries to consider: Prophet Velen, King Krush, Grommash Hellscream   THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ||||| Thalnos.  One of the top 3 neutral legendaries and you already have the other two.  As far as class specific goes, you'd be hardpressed to convince me another legendary is better than antonidas. ||||| Currently, I'd say the 4 MUST have legendaries are Ragnaros, Ysera, Sylvannas, and Thalnos.  As for which of the two you should craft, I'd say Thalnos for this particular meta. The meta is just too aggressive and early game focused for Ysera to be as good as she can be. ||||| Well, I think every legendary is prone to Silence/Poly/Hex/Assassinate/Execute.  Me personally will pick Ysera, 4/12, atleast Priests won't be able to Shadow Word it, and pyro alone won't kill it, even if its Pyro+ping (unless the pyro is enhanced of course).  Cairne is also interesting based on what I see in database. If it's Poly/Hex, well, that means my enemy have 1 less Poly/Hex. If it's get shot down, then they have to face it once more.

5458	1,3,3	5	I'm reading "The Science of Interstellar" and I came across this excerpt in the 7th chapter by Kip Thorne, the author:  >Navigating a spacecraft near Gargantua is hard because the speeds are very high. To survive, a planet or star or spacecraft must counteract Gargantua’s huge gravity with a comparably huge centrifugal force. This means it must move at very high speed. Near the speed of light, it turns out. In my science interpretation of Interstellar, the Endurance, parked at ten Gargantua radii while the crew visit Miller’s planet, moves at one-third the speed of light: c/3, where c represents the speed of light. Miller’s planet moves at 55 percent the speed of light, 0.55c.   I'm not sure if I understand this correctly but does it mean that Endurance was moving at c/3 speed? Somebody please explain this! ||||| The simple answer is yes because it is stated explicitly on the text. But probably you want a more explanation why that Endurance was moving at c/3 speed, do you?  Let me explain in a Newtonian Physics of Circular motion.  The earth are pulled by the sun with this equation:  Gravitational Force = G x mass of the earth x mass of the sun / R^2  Where R is the distant between earth and the sun. While to maintain on its orbit, the earth's velocity needs to fit this equation:  Gravitational Force = mass of the earth x (velocity)^2 / R  If the velocity is too slow, it would be pulled by the sun and then hit the sun. If the velocity is too fast, it would leave the orbit and go away from the sun.  We can work on both equation and get this:  G x mass of the earth x mass of the sun / R^2 = mass of the earth x (velocity)^2 / R  cancel "mass of the earh" and "R", we get:  G x mass of the sun / R = (velocity)^2  G x mass of the sun = (velocity)^2 x R  Since G and mass of the sun is constant, then we can simply say:  (velocity)^2 is inversely proportional to the distant of the earth to the sun.  The equation is also valid for other planets, or any object. (velocity)^2 of an object is inversely proportional to the distant of the object to the sun. Simply put: **The larger the distant of an object to the sun, the slower it needs to stay at the orbit**.  ...................  The concept is also applicable on the Gargantua, Miller Planet, and the Endurance. Gargantua is on the center, like the sun. Miller Planet is in a short distance to the Gargantua, thus, it needs to move at 0,55c just to stay on its orbit. While the Endurance stay at a farther distance, thus, it doesn't have to move as fast, but still has to be fast enough to stay at the orbit. Speed c/3 is just about right. ||||| [deleted]

That being said, this gun is the gun that I have achieved the most success in ranked with; it is extremely powerful, has decent range, is the 2nd highest DPS weapon out of all shooters, has great support with Splash Walls and Killer Wail, and is a nightmare to go against. When your opponent can take you out in TWO SHOTS, and is hiding behind a wall in which you cannot touch them until you take out that wall... things do not look good for you. This is an amazing gun whose utility will run all the way to S+ 99. There are very few drawbacks to this gun which are VASTLY outweighed by its strengths.  Special tips:  * One defense up main (or i believe two subs) will turn this gun from a two-shot kill to a three-shot kill. This is negated when the person using the gun wears a damage up main. This is why it is recommended for Tentateks and other equal range 3 to 4 shot kill weapons to wear a defense up main or more when expecting to face off against this weapon. Additionally, this is why it is recommended for .52 gal users to wear one damage up main.  * Ink saver sub is very useful for this weapon, because splash walls are extremely ink hungry and if you just spray and pray you will be left VERY vulnerable by the time your splash wall is depleted.  * Staying under your splash wall or too close to your splash wall will leave you very vulnerable to suction bomb users. **NOTE: LOBBING A SUCTION BOMB AT A SPLASH WALL WILL CAUSE IT TO IMMEDIATELY EXPLODE, CAUSING A CONSIDERABLE RADIUS.** Sometimes, you can catch people behind the splash walls or people trying to (dumbly) advance ahead of their splash walls and get an instakill on what should be a disadvantaged 1v1.  * This is one of the lesser mobile shooter class weapons, as it decreases running speed while firing to a lesser speed than that of the splattershots and the n-zaps, which are equal range. This means that you can out-strafe this weapon - but be warned, the extremely fast TTK / DPS of this weapon makes it so that any stray hit has the possibility to be lethal.  * This gun sacrifices accuracy for power, an as such, you may be depending on RNG to not fail you in some 1v1s. The splash wall is one way to deal with this - you can get more shots off while protecting yourself in case RNG fails you.  * Tower control players must learn how to find avenues by the tower's path which make it possible to throw a splash wall directly onto the tower. Protection of the tower is key, as it will give those riding the tower that extra defense boost necessary to ride the tower just a bit longer and possibly take out foes trying to knock you off.

S H O U L D . B E . B U R N I N G . I N . H E L L. ||||| I definitely have to say this weapon is the one I worry about the most when I see it in game. I tend to trade a lot with these guns due to having the same HTK. If I can ambush one I usually do okay, but it's good to know if they ambush me I can still trade due to our TTK.  But if it's an even firefight, chances are that the gal will throw down it's splash wall. In this instance, if you are a brush user who gets caught on the wrong side of a splash wall you have to either get around it or run away.  If you have good reaction times, however, there's a third option which usually works well for me. If you see a gal in a good position to throw their wall, swim towards them. They won't be firing til the wall is up, and you'll end up on the same side of the wall as them, making for an easy surprise kill, especially if you get out of their field of view while doing this. ||||| The .52 was my main back when I first started playing, and I've recently picked it back up again because I'm just not having success with anything else and I do far better when I use this. I'd like to say that it's because I just have a knack for it, but in reality it's just that this weapon is so ridiculously powerful that it makes up for my incompetence.  Honestly it sometimes feels like this weapon is a little *too* good. Between the Splash Wall, 2-hit kill, and decent fire rate, there are hardly any drawbacks at all. While it doesn't have the highest range and has lower maneuverability than other shooters, these issues are quite minor compared to the aforementioned strengths. Killer Wail isn't the best special, but it's still quite effective in the right hands, especially considering how quickly it charges.  The .52 is easily among the best weapons in the game, and I'm actually surprised that I don't see balance complaints about it more often. I don't think they'd be entirely misplaced. ||||| Most BS weapon in the game. The end. ||||| I hate all people who use .gals.

I am seeing a few of them around in S+ though. Lowest TTK in the game, I believe? 12 frames or something like that? Crazy stuff. ||||| Fuck this weapon. Earlier today I played a simple game of Turf War that ended up being one of the most humiliating and demoralizing games I can remember. It was on Hammerhead Bridge, against a team full of Japanese players. At the helm of the enemy team was some guy with the .52. That team pushed us back to our spawn after a decent start and we could not find a way out at all. Behind the Splash Wall of immense pain and suffering the .52 player continuously slaughtered us, while the others picked off whichever poor members of our team remained. ||||| I just remember DUDE got 38-8 with this weapon in tower control on port mackerel without even throwing many walls. Anyone who can find a video of 40 splats in higher ranked lobby pls let me know. ||||| Good Maps vs. Bad Maps: ||||| I love this Weapon! This have been my main in Ranked.

I think its the best local brewery in Asheville.  The beer is served straight from the vats.  I think they open at 4 and there will be a line waiting before they open.  Its that good.  [URL] ||||| I haven't been to it yet but Wicked Weed is supposed to be awesome. Hit up Thirsty Monk too.  ||||| Highland and Oskar Blues are my vote.  ||||| [This site]([URL] is great for looking things up for your trip. My SO and I took a trip to Asheville (and are doing so again in a month and a half since we liked it so much) last year and hit every microbrewery for a tasting. We stayed downtown, and could walk to most of these. The Oskar Blues, NB, and SN places weren't open yet. This is the best of my recollection (with * ratings * - ****):  * Asheville Brewing Company: Enjoyed their darker beers a lot (common theme through our trip. I love most styles that aren't light lagers and found the stouts were top notch at most places, while the IPAs generally were solid, but not amazing). They had great flavor and good body, which was a good thing since they had a jalepaneo pale ale that was very spicy. Good one to check out for the beer, less so for the atmosphere. ***  * Craggie: Very interesting/different beers on draft with smaller location and interesting atmosphere. Tough to really describe, but one I would suggest. ABC, Green Man and Craggie are all quite close to each other, South of downtown. ***  * French Broad: Had to drive here. Another place with solid beer, good atmosphere and outside seating if you want it. **1/2  * Green Man Brewing: Great atmosphere, beer was okay other than the nitro beer they had (some english style) which I really enjoyed. **1/2  * Highland: Great tour (you get a cup of their amber for it), lots of a good information and our tour guide really seemed to know her stuff. You get to walk around the brewery and see all the fun stuff. Tasting room is great too, as they typically have cool versions of their traditional beers (barrel-aged amber and IPA when we were there). Outside seating, they have events fairly often, and the tasting room had a very cool atmosphere. As a bonus, if you go at the right time (Friday afternoon) the moonshine distillery next door does tastings/tour as well. ****  * Lexington Ave Brewery (LAB): Cool hip kind of brew pub in downtown. Seemed like more of a young person club when we went on a Friday night than a bar, but it was something different. Beers were solid, but nothing amazing. Really liked the raspberry stout on nitro though, something different and balanced well. Maybe one to check out earlier in the day fi you don't want the club feel, or later if you do. **  * Oyster House Brewing: This is a small brewery inside of a restaurant. When we went it was tough to find a place to sit (since they focus on food) and they only had 1 or 2 beers that were theirs. Oyster stout was all right, nothing I would recommend trying unless you want to hit every brewery like we did. *  * Pisgah Brewing: Interesting location. Outside of town and in what amounts to a warehouse. Beer was very good and I liked the bar. This was the first place we hit, and they had a great selection of their beers, as well as some guest taps. ***  * Thirsty Monk: Bar (they have a south nanobrewery location) that is pretty amazing. Great beers upstairs, amazing sours and belgian downstairs. My girlfriend and I loved this place (for the sours particularly). ****  * Wedge: Right near the River Arts District. It is located at the bottom of an industrial building. Came highly recommended, same as the RA area. Was disappointed by both. Found the beers okay, but not special. Atmosphere seemed snobbishly local. Others seem to love this place though, so it may be worth a try to see if they are to your taste. RA area paintings were absurdly priced and walking around wasn't as easy as I would have liked. *1/2  * There were a few more that we went to, but I cannot find them on the site. Maybe they shut down?   Anyways, I don't think you can go wrong with any of the breweries, but those were my impressions.

Just make sure you don't forget you have the checklist. write it on something that wont get destroyed and keep it on you somewhere where even if you forget about having it it can remind you it's there. for instance on a long lanyard attached to your pants so it will hit the door on your way out, then you remember it's there and you can check it before leaving the room and make sure everything is in order before you leave. you could also post little signs everywhere for yourself like at the doors reminding you to close them or on the diaper bag reminding you to throw away the diaper. the key is being able to remind yourself even if you forget. hope this helps! ||||| Hey there!

I graduate in 3 weeks. I had no clue what I wanted to major in until it was too late for my GPA. No real IT experience other than working at staples in their easy tech dept. I'm in the process of finals right now but after that it'll be nothing but job searching and I'll probably end up in a call center, NOC, or tech support to start off with. ||||| To be honest, you're going to have a really hard time getting a decent paying job without some kind of IT experience or internship. There's no shame in starting at a help desk position and working your way up though, a lot of people do that. For a help desk position you should expect 30-40k (for a private company) a year depending on the company... If you don't want to start out at a helpdesk your best bet is to do as many interviews as you can (at school job fairs, etc.) and network with as many professionals as possible.  The best advice I can give you is to know what you want to do with your IT degree.  So many people go into interviews for entry-level IT jobs and can't answer the simple question of "What do you want to do?" IT is a pretty broad subject so you should focus on a specific area, i.e. java programming, database administration, project management, etc.  ||||| I'm alos kind of in the same boat except I have a 150 hours of internship as helpdesk in my college. I have a 2 year degree. I want to build WAN Networks. I wonder if any of you have any tips and direction into getting there someday.  ||||| I may be starting in IT at a behavioural health company. This is probably on the low end but he said anywhere between 34-46K salaried. That's a plus to making $30K- as a case manager. ||||| Getting a job in IT isn't necessarily about having all the answers. Its about knowing how to find the answers. You might not know jack shit about how to solve a problem if it was presented to you, but if at the end of the day you are able to figure that out, then you've already succeeded. My manager when hiring looks for candidates that have the right thought-process when troubleshooting.

8060	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	My store sucks at getting the weekly tasks in the duty roster done.  I've tried to brainstorm ways of breaking them up in ways that make sense and make it easier to get all of them done, and would love tips from stores that are successful in this regard?  Do you assign tasks to specific partners, or to specific days of the week, etc? ||||| At my store one of the SS randomly assigns everyone a task to do by the end of the week. It doesn't matter when, as long as it gets done. She makes sure we do them by giving us two tasks the following week if we didn't do the first task. The only exception is if you're on vacation or out sick. It works pretty well, and having one task seems a lot less daunting than looking at the whole list and trying to take it on a few tasks at a time.  ||||| My manager calls two out a day under the shift supervisor duties. So today my task was the mats, the closing supervisor has the fridges. We can delegate the tasks to whoever we want. On Mondays she goes through the previous weeks tasks and highlights the ones that didn't get done. There's usually only one or two that get missed and they're always from one of the supervisors -.- ||||| good question because thats the project in currently working on as well. ive found when you high light a few tasks per day, it still gets neglected and when u assign per person its still just kinda forgotten about sometimes. those things usually work well for a week or two then get unintentionally neglected. what ive been doing lately is assignig a few tasks per day but individually writing them out on the dcrs so that everyone actually sees what needs to be done and shifts can then delegate, since that page/duty roster in general isnt usually looked at very often, especially by baristas on their own, theyre just unaware of it. its sometimes still not perfect but at least a step closer towards most things being completed but since my process is still relatively new we'll see how in goes over time ||||| We broke tasks down by days of the week, and then on each day, broke up the tasks according to day part so everyone knows what shifts are in charge of making sure what gets done.   There's a little table that my manager made for our DCR templates, with room to assign and initial each task. The bulk of the tasks get assigned to the mid, because mornings are busy and evenings you've got closing to focus on.   I think it only ends up being, like, three tasks per day, but you could do more for easy ones like wiping down the pastry cart. We also assigned drains three times per week, I think, because they get nasty so quickly. And that way, if someone has to skip a day (it happens), there's a good chance of them getting done at least once per week. We do deck brushing the same way--break the cafe down into seven more or less equal parts, and assign each part to a day of the week. But our cafe is also humongous and it would take at least half an hour to deck brush the entire thing.  ||||| the weekly task list is on our back fridge. each has a day to do them assigned. afternoon Store Support is supposed to incorporate the tasks for the day when on the 30 minute cadence. ||||| At our store each task is supposed to get done on a certain day. Beyond that it's pretty easy for us since we're absolutely dead after 2 PM or so. ||||| Every week, the shift in charge of store operations (right now, me), distributes the weekly chores and writes them down on the DCR.  So, I'll give one or two for the morning shift to either do themselves or task out, and same with the mid/evening shifts.  The way I distribute is based on what day/who is working, that way slower work days with more people get the more time consuming tasks, and busier days with less people get easier tasks.  This also helps make sure the same person doesn't get stuck doing trash bins every week etc.       If you have an accountability issue like our store, this works pretty well. We definitely could never do a system where everyone gets one task each week and they have to do it whenever they can that week- nothing would ever get done haha.  ||||| My manager has assigned each task to a partner in the store and they are responsible for getting it done by the end of the week. This method has many advantages like knowing who to talk to if it doesn't get done, plus you "learn" your task inside and out so it always gets done really well. ||||| We assign tasks to days of the week. It's pretty easy to get it done if everyone attempts to do one thing per shift. (Very busy LS, not enough baristas. "Attempt" is the key word there. We keep each other updated if we get halfway through a task and can't finish.) A couple months ago, we were REALLY sucking at it, so I started highlighting anything that got missed so we could make sure to do it sooner. Eventually everyone got used to the schedule and now we almost never miss tasks. :) We all have our favorite and least favorite ones, but it balances out pretty well.

I realized too late (6:57pm) that I left off Oregon State. I hurriedly added them at 22 (the line where I started adding new teams), but they are probably too low there. I apologize.  Three teams are undefeated and bowl eligible. They occupy the top three spots. The BCS computers agree with my rankings, and I've been fairly consistent with the placement of those teams. I'm okay with this. I still think Oregon will have a great opportunity to break into the Top 2, but as of right now someone one is getting shafted should all three win out.  I'm a little uneasy with the SEC at 4-5-6-7 and 9. It probably shouldn't be that way, and I'll consider shaking it up next week. Florida and Georgia will play a good OOC opponent soon, and Texas A&M has a quality OOC win against LaTech. ||||| LSU losses: Florida, Alabama  Texas A&M losses: Florida and LSU  LSU beat A&M.      8. A&M      9. LSU  Makes perfect sense. ||||| [URL]  ------ The Top 25:  Kansas State moves to #1.  The Wildcats have beaten a lot of very good opponents, and they haven't struggled in any game.  Oklahoma, Iowa State, and now TCU have played them close, but in each of those games the team compensated for whichever group was being stymied.  In Fort Worth the Horned Frogs gave the Wildcat offense fits; this might have been one of the best defensive efforts this team has had to overcome.  But TCU couldn't keep Klein contained on every play, and he still exploited their mistakes.  The defense also stepped up by keeping TCU out of the end zone until it was too late.    Oregon slips to 2 because they win big, but they need the offense to run up the score.  They can't rely on a defense to shut good offenses down.  Ohio State continues to edge Notre Dame despite the Irish's better resume of wins, they play down to the competition far too often.  They've only beaten Purdue, BYU, and Pitt by field goals, the latter taking three overtimes to decide.  Florida slides back quite a bit because of their tepid performance against UL-L.  A top ten team should not look that listless and vulnerable at home.  Georgia hops above Florida State because the Seminoles had trouble separating themselves from Va Tech.  Texas A&M makes a big leap from 16 to 7.  It looks drastic, but A&M looks stronger and stronger each week. Three teams ahead of them lost, including the #1 team the Aggies knocked off on the road.  In fact, A&M is 3-2 against my Top 25, winning all three on the road.  Alabama falls to 8, just behind A&M.  Clemson and Oklahoma remain in place; beating Maryland and Baylor by solid wins at home was exactly what was expected of them.  Florida falls to 11, just ahead of the LSU team they beat.  Stanford passes a South Carolina team letting bottom-tier conference teams stay in games.  Nebraska, Texas, and UCLA all move up because of the Louisville and Oregon State vacancies.  Texas and UCLA vault Louisiana Tech in the process because the Bulldogs showed a lack of defense against Texas State.  Oregon State falls to 19, and Louisville to 20.  UCF falls upward to fill in the gap at 21.  Northern Illinois moves up to 23.  The first three-loss team of the year makes it onto my list; Michigan has proven itself to be a Top 25 team again by overcoming it's 1-2 start.  Kent State fills in the last spot.  ------ Moving onto the List:  Tulsa (22):  They've won seven straight and will likely host the CUSA title game.  Michigan, Kent State (24, 25).  My last two teams are the best of what's left.  The Wolverines have gone 5-1 since October 1st, with a single loss at Nebraska.  This is a down year for the Big Ten, but having to play two Top 5 (until this week) programs away from home in the first three weeks of the season isn't easy for anyone.  And Kent State has only lost one game - at Kentucky early in the year.   Since then they've won eight straight, including at Rutgers.  Their resume isn't spectacular, but it doesn't have to be when you look at the teams they were competing with for that last spot.  ------ Falling out of the Rankings:  Northwestern:  Three losses in this year's Big Ten makes it difficult to stay in the Top 25.  Michigan replaces them not just because of the head-to-head win, but Northwestern's biggest victory to date remains at Minnesota.  Michigan did that too.  Toledo:  After taking a mid-tier Pac-12 Arizona to overtime before losing, the Rockets ripped off 8 consecutive wins.  The most impressive of these was knocking off then-#21 Cincinnati at home.  But their only other win over a 1-A team with a winning record was against Bowling Green.  They might have a chance to crawl back into the rankings with a blowout against Northern Illinois, but that's highly unlikely.  Mississippi State:  The Bulldogs have lost three straight, albeit to ranked teams.  They climbed to #13 in the AP by beating bad teams.  In fact, the only 1-A team with a winning record they've beaten was Middle Tennessee.  They've got Arkansas and Ole Miss left to play, so they might be able to climb back up if a lot of teams lose again.  ------- "Wait, go back; Texas A&M at 7, Florida/LSU at 11/12?"  A&M effectively moves up seven spots instead of nine because the losses by Louisville and Oregon State bump everyone up.  The Aggies beat the number one team in their building and did so by doing two things.  1:  They started the game by kicking Alabama in the teeth.  Nobody had scored more than 17 on Alabama in a game this season; Texas A&M racked up 20 in the first quarter, and never let Bama lead.  They dictated the tempo and the line of scrimmage, racking up more than double the rushing yardage allowed per game by the nation's second-best defense.  That game was not as close as the score indicated.    What does that all mean?  It means we have been undervaluing the Aggies, not entirely unlike how Mississippi State was overrated four weeks ago.  2:  They've jumped three teams with one fewer loss, because they are playing better than all three of those teams.  They just beat Alabama.  Clemson's best wins this year were against Virginia Tech and Duke.  Florida has not looked good since October 20.  In the last three weeks they've lost to Georgia, got shut out in the first half at home against Missouri, and needed a blocked punt to avoid going into overtime against UL-L.    In light of that game, I am considering a new rule for UNC_Samurai's Top 25 Rankings:  *Any program losing at home in November in the fourth quarter to the fourth-best Sun Belt team is disqualified from the Top 10.*  ------ "Why Kent State Over…"  Boise?  The Broncos looked average in dropping a home game to San Diego State.  Texas Tech?  The Raiders needed multiple overtimes to beat Kansas.  Wisconsin?  The Badgers have only beaten two 1-A teams with winning records this year - Utah St. and Minnesota, and lost at home to Michigan State.  A blowout road win over Indiana is a start, but it's not enough to convince me they're Top 25 material again.  USC?  This win over Arizona State was the best opponent they've defeated all year, and those losses to Arizona and Oregon still have me wondering where their defense disappears to.  Oklahoma State?  They've lost big to Arizona, let Texas control the clock in that loss, barely beat Kansas, and they can't stop anyone from passing.  This squad has three games left, against Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Baylor - they could easily move up, but for now they're on the bubble.  EDIT:  I accidentally my entry for Northwestern. ||||| NOOO! Dropped to 7th least controversial. Apparently I need to be less generous to non-BCS teams that have only one loss that came against BCS teams, and more generous to USC who has three losses and whose strength of wins is approximately the same as those other teams. Seems reasonable. ||||| I don't have a problem with Alabama getting dropped like this because I feel that they only won against LSU because LSU pissed the game away.  Prevent defense is one of the worst things to have ever been created in both basketball AND football.  If you play to not lose, you don't deserve to win.  Alabama is a good team, but they haven't played in a manner that is as dominant as their reputation as the hands down first in the nation implied they should have. ||||| /u/Khavanon /u/jlh2b /u/billybobsckor /u/FellKnight /u/rapsca /u/Weeniswrinkle /u/Wescat  How do you justify deciding to rank Ohio State, and put them at 10 or lower as an undefeated team? I understand why you would decide to not rank them at all, but how do you justify putting them under so many one and/or two loss teams? ||||| [My ballot]([URL]    No changes in methodology from [last week]([URL]  >My basic formula is **(A + B - C^1.25 )/n**   > >**(A)** Each team received one point for a victory over a 1-A team, half a point for a victory over a 1-AA team and zero points for victories over any other teams (relevant for UTSA.)   >**(B)** Each team received a tenth of a point for each victory by a team they defeated (with victories over 1-AA teams again counting for half as much and victories over any other teams not counting at all.)   >**(C)** Each team received a deduction of a tenth of a point for every loss incurred by a team they suffered a defeat to.   >**n** was the number of games played by each team.   The exponential treatment of the loss deduction is intended to punish losing to bad teams more relative to losing to good teams.    Ties (applicable between Oregon and Florida, and also between LSU and Louisiana Tech) were broken by giving preference to the team whose defeated opponents had the most combined net wins (wins minus losses,) again adjusted for type of opponent.  Here are the teams that our poll ranked (and I did not) and where they fit into my formula's order:    [](/southerncal) USC was 33rd on my ballot.  Just look at their wins.  Two over atrocious teams (Hawaii and Colorado), two over flawed teams (Cal and Utah), two over mediocre teams (Syracuse and ASU) and just one over a decent team (6-4 Washington).  That's one win over a team with a winning record, out of four attempts.  Not good.    [](/texastech) Texas Tech was 34th on my ballot.  Like USC, two of their wins are over horrible teams (Northwestern State and Kansas) and most of the rest are over mediocre to bad teams.  Though two wins are over teams with winning records (WVU and TCU), they fall behind USC due my decision to punish playing a Div. 1-AA team.    Leaving off only two teams the poll ranked equals a season low for me.

Sadly, I didn't catch any hints to Dark Souls. ||||| I've heard a lot of talk about the rope bridge being related to the Painted World.  Personally I thought lots of the basic enemies had helmets that looked like the paladin set, so either new gods or returning gods in DS2. ||||| There were a few similarities. Like the statue and the bridge to the floating dragon castle, however, the interview with the dev's today stated that they were not sure if they were going to link the stories. ||||| The helmets the enemies were wearing looked like the one from the paladin set, i think Thorolund had the same fate as the realm of Balder.

"five jump chump" badge) in the Navy?  Everyone I ever came across in the Navy with jump wings had the gold ones and had some high speed job (e.g. Seal) so is it just incredibly uncommon to have the basic badge or is it like an unspoken rule you don't wear jump wings unless you're a Seal or something (in which case you'll have the extra jumps for the gold badge)? i.e. should I wear mine? ||||| I think you can, but you'd need to check the navy uniform regulations:   [URL] ||||| I know three people that wear the Basic Parachutist Badge, all earned as enlisted Sailors assigned to SPECWAR or Leap Frogs.  Two are now commissioned and all still wear their silver insignia. ||||| You're fine. Its rare but I've certainly seen it. Don't wear the gold ones - that would be bad ||||| If you have5 extra qualifying jumps you should be good. My only worry is you may need to have the 5 jumps on active Naval service before turning gold. 
6501	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	27	I have pretty much all cards i want for my cube, and now im looking to pimp it out.  Right now, im thinking about foreign cards, foils, and promos... how do you pimp yours out and what is the most swag?  Edit: There doesnt seem to be a lot of love for foils/foreign cards here, im surprised. ||||| Depends what you want. I don't like foreign cards as it can limit who can play with your cube. But from there you just have to find out what you like the most. I love promos, so I value those over other cards, but not everyone feels that way.  ||||| Personally, I recommend against using any foreign cards. The reason for this is, if you have people play with it who are unfamiliar with the cards, it will be that much harder for them if the cards are not in their native language. English cards at least give people an idea of what they do, even if the rules text has changed somewhat in the case of old cards. ||||| Foils where I can get them, English only because I want my Cube to be accessible. ||||| Put 22 inch rims on the box?  I keep it english as my group wouldnt know.  I go textless only for well known cards and if they look good (Bolt) and old border foil when possible unless a better art exists in new border. ||||| Back when I started my Cube, I sort of had a hierarchy in which I'd try to acquire cards:  Foil Old Art / New Frame Non-Foil Old Art / New Frame Foil or Non-Foil Homage to Old Art / New Frame Foil Old Non-Ugly Art / Old Frame Foil New Art / New Frame Everything Else  Generally for most Cube staples you have at least one good art.  I can think of a couple of exceptions (I've never liked the art for any of the Mana Leaks, and I'm not too fond of any arts for Swords to Plowshares), but I'd usually set my sights on a specific art that I'd like best and try to acquire it at any cost.  I'm particularly proud of my Coldsnap new frame Ice Age reprints for some staples, even if they're not the most expensive cards.    Sometimes it's fun to get pimp simply because it's a card you almost never see.  The 10th Ed box topper Birds of Paradise is a good example, as is my JSS Royal Assassin.  I stay away from textless and foreign cards because I want my Cube to be newbie friendly, I've cubed with some new Standard-only players who haven't seen some eternal staples and it's easier that way.  I've been thinking of going towards original printings for everything that has an original printing before The Dark, I'm no longer as in love with the New Frame as I used to be.    Land pimp is another way to go, and has different levels to where you can pimp.  Cheapest way is just to use only land arts you like, old frame lands, old frame lands that still had text, then the Zendikar full arts, then all foil lands, then un-lands, then Beta lands, then going into stuff like promo lands like APAC or Guru lands.  I personally am making my ultimate goal to use only APAC lands, but that's pretty far off into the future and I might decide against it because it'll make my Cube too expensive to play with people I don't know well.    If you like foils though, pimping has gotten really expensive.  It used to be that a foil would maybe be $1-$5 more than the non-foil, but nowadays it's jumped to 2x-4x the price which can get painful as many Cube staples are already not cheap to begin with.    EDIT: Oh, one thing I forgot...anything with a watermark (Mirran / Phyrexian cards, anything guild-aligned from original Ravnica or RTR) I will always try to get in foil because honestly foil watermarks look awesome. ||||| I don't use any foreign cards and I don't use any textless cards, so people who don't know all the cards in the cube can still play.    I do, however, love altered art stuff.  It's noticeably cheaper than high end foils to get your cards altered (The guy who does most of my stuff charges ~$20 a card, depending on the art), so my altered JTMS is pimp at a much lower price point than a foil JTMS would've been.  Check out my cube [here]([URL] and click on the "Altered Card Gallery" spoiler to see all my pretty alters :)  The Force of Will is easily my favorite, but there are a lot of goodies there. ||||| I'm trying to foil it with the cards I personally find the most beautiful. Origonal Muldrifter, 6th Ed Mana Leak, 7th Memory Lapse, Promo Lotus Cobra. Some cards I don't like any of like Hymn so I might have just picked at random.  I like older boarder more than newr but like foils better than nonfoils and always take a judge promo when I can. (Still need Survival, damnit)  EDIT: All english, no textless. ||||| Swoosh foil is the best, followed by Alpha/Beta. After that I go with what art I like best. ||||| Foils and promos when I can get then, but I don't go out of my way to pick them up. I also agree with the general English only sentiment to keep the cube accessible, but I am guilty of running a textless promo or two... ||||| Personally, I'd keep it English and get the cards [altered]([URL] ||||| Well my cube's "theme" is foil. I built it foil from the ground up. It's been fun... but expensive! It has also been a challenge to make a cube without all the older cards that have never been in foil.  All my basic lands (50 each) are foil and I keep it all in a RTR Holiday Gift Box :)  [URL] ||||| [deleted]    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3871   > [What is this?]([URL] ||||| I want alpha/beta cards when applicable - Nothin like a beta sol ring, Demonic Tutor, regrowth and basalt monolith :)  After that its promo's then set foils.  I like promo's so other players can see art that they never knew existed.    Never foreign (at least for this guy) as it limits who can cube with you.  I actively pass up foreign cards tell I can find an English one.   ||||| I go for oldest printing with good art. Avoiding foils because I don't want to foil my cube.       Also for cheap/silly things I alter them. ||||| I try to get full-art stuff as much as possible. There are a few exceptions- I probably won't get the full-art Cryptic Command just because it's much easier to play the card if you have all the modes in front of you. If it's not available in full-art, I try to foil it out (often with promos). I also have a few foreign and signed cards. ||||| I get old border foils over new border foils. And I'm having cards that cannot be foiled/super pimped (ie only WB available) altered. ||||| I love foils, actually. So I'm very slowly working on foiling my cube for cards that can be foiled (english only). Usually, by trades, so it's slow. Sometimes I'll see a hard-to-find foil in a store and pick it up, but that's even rarer.  I'm also working on a great foil-of-every-basic-land collection for the cube. So every set, every art, in foil, where available, and promos where applicable. I'm up to over 200 lands now, which is pretty sweet. ||||| Foils. Old frame if they're available. New frame promos if the art is cooler than the original. Art alters for those not available in foil. ||||| I prefer Alpha/Beta first when possible as well as old border originals such as Arabian Nights, Antiquities etc. After that I like to use old frame or original set foils unless the promo is just plain better. I also try to keep everything in English although I'm currently using a few German Beta's until I can upgrade to English Alpha/Beta. As for lands I have 45 of each in Beta, 15 of each art. ||||| You know what really improves the Magic experience? Flavor text. When possible I will pick which printing of a card I use depending on the flavor text on it.    (Foils are nice too) ||||| 40 lands of each color to draft with.  They're all Guru lands. ||||| [URL] ||||| I don't.  I hate the idea of "pimped out" Magic cards. I despise foils. Despise foreign cards. There are some promos that I like, but I don't think I'm playing any.  I had a foreign bituminous blast for the longest time and it annoyed everyone at the table when it was in their pack because inevitably someone would have to look it up.  The furthest I would say I go is trying to get original versions of cards over newer printed ones, unless I like the art more.

5236	1,2,1,1,3,3	12	With the new formats, there will be no excuse for bad cards. Standard excuse was "synergy cards don't exist yet!". But now... they will never exits!

Sigh. ||||| There will still be cards that are only see play in arena like kraken and cards that will only be good in wild because of lack of synergy in standard. ||||| Bad cards are necessary because they limit the power of random cards, like Shredder, Portal, Ram Wrengler.  And Wild will still be a thing. If people think that only noobs will play wild then they will also play wild to rank up really easily and get their legend chest.
157	1,2,3,3	7	A bit of history: we bought Elizabeth almost 5 years ago when she was tiny along with a few other fish friends. Since then, she has outlived everyone and has outgrown several tanks. We just bought a house and have transported her into a new 55 gallon tank.  Just before we moved her, we noticed that she wasn't looking too good. Going back and forth from the apartment to the house and not seeing us in the evening during the move probably made her a bit down. In addition, taking her out of the tank and transporting her probably made her a bit stressed out.  When we set up the new tank, we introduced her slowly and added Stress Coat and Stress Zyme. She has acclimated to her new environment and is swimming happily in her new, larger tank.  **But**, we have noticed fin rot developing. Would introducing aquarium salt in conjunction with the stress coat make an overly salty environment?  [Elizabeth in her majesty.]([URL] From tip of tail to head, she's about 15 inches. ||||| Was the new tank properly cycled before you introduced her into it? Could possibly be ammonia burn.  Do you have a water test kit?  ||||| It's safe for you to add aquarium salt to combat the gram negative bacteria.  Stress coat won't contribute much in way of salt.  Or you can use antibiotics.    Test for ammonia as Stinky says.  Ammonia can cause fin rot too.  Stress coat contains sodium thiosulfate, which will neutralize ammonia.  However, I would feel better/safer if you used SeaChem Prime or Amquel (not Amquel Plus) for this emergency purpose if you need to bring down ammonia quickly. ||||| Goldfish love salt, that should always be the second thing you go for with goldfish.

3897	1,3	6	A little bit about me is I'm a junior in college and have had bouts of depression since I was a kid. Recently I started having frequent thought of suicide, and have been deeply depressed for about a year or two. I had an emotional breakdown a couple months ago and started planning, but didn't go through with a suicide attempt. Now I'm on 20mg of prozac a day. I've been taking it for about three weeks, and some days I seem to be doing better, but other days seem worse. Most days I just feel nothing. I am working a part time job at a grocery store, and it's driving me insane. I have to go in, in about two hours, and I'm freaking out. Before work I get tense and panicky. Sometimes I have full blown panic attacks. I always feel nauseous before hand. I'm seriously thinking about stabbing my hand, or driving my car off a small cliff on my way to work. I just can take the anxiety of being around other people. Especially since i'm in a new department, and don't know what I'm doing. I was thinking about taking a ton of prozac to make myself sick and say it was an accident, but then i looked up how much I would have to take, and decided it wasn't worth it. I took off a couple weeks in December, and told my bosses it was for holiday stuff. Last week I had a cold and got a doctors note I used that as an excuse to skip three days. I don't think I can get out of work unless I do something big. I'm so irrationally terrified of going to work, and talking to people that I am really considering hurting myself in a big way to get out of it. I want broken bones or something on that level. I must sound insane. I think I might be. I don't know what to do. How do I get through this? How do i get out of it with out killing myself?  ||||| >How do i get out of it with out killing myself?  You quit your job.  It sounds like you have other things going on besides your job, but keep in mind that working at a grocery store isn't your career. This is something you're just doing right now to keep yourself afloat while you're in school. In two years you'll have graduated and can move on to a job you actually enjoy.   If you hate being at your job so much right now, but still need to have a job, start looking for something else. Preferably something related to what you want to do for your career, but really ... anything else. 
8320	1,3,3,2	12	I have these two nodes that are circles and when they get in contact with each other I want there to be a collision so they bounce off each other. I have this code but nothings happening....how could I fix this?            func contactCollision() {                           circle.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: circle.size.width)         circle.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = 1         circle.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = 1         circle.physicsBody?.dynamic = true                  circle2.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: circle2.size.height)         circle2.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = 1         circle2.physicsBody?.dynamic = true         circle2.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = 1                                     }        ||||| Don't forget to assign the circle's categoryBitMask. That's the number you should be putting in the contactTestBitMask. So you would have something like:  circle1.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = 1  circle1.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = 2   circle2.physicsBody?.categoryBitMask = 2   circle2.physicsBody?.contactTestBitMask = 1 ||||| For starters just comment out the collisionBitMask settings.  By default physicsNodes collide with everything.  If you set two physicsNodes on a collision course and haven't set either collisionBitMask and they are dynamic then they will automatically collide and bounce off.  The exception would be if they are moving so fast that they pass through each other.  So start with large cirlces moving slowly and then experiment.  ||||| You say "nothings happening"... Do you mean that the circles aren't moving? Do you have gravity or some other force in the scene that would make the circles move?

I'm talking about [this]([URL] kind of crap, in case you are wondering.  I want science goddamn it! Can ya'll hook a brotha up?  PS: I asked you guys, instead of /r/psychology because I trust you to have filtered out the crap that I would filter out. (If that makes sense) ||||| I studied psychology in college at a very research oriented university and I have similar thoughts. Like "why do guys compensate for insecurity with arrogance when girls tend to just admit they're insecure?"   First of all, a lot of scholarly articles require you to pay a subscription to read them, which is annoying.   Second, researchers don't care about the same shit I do because I have tried writing research papers on these nuances and not only is there "not much" research, which is usually required for more conclusive results, there's no research at all. Also annoying. It's hard to get funding for research psychologists and grants go to research toward other things.   Third: all the "psychology" books on a shelf in a Barnes and Noble or similar, are rarely written by actual psychologists and frequently written by journalists sensationalizing the results of someone else's study.   So what I'm saying is, read everything with a critical mind when it comes to these psychology topics. Everyone claims to be an "expert" but the posts on reddit like "new study discovers schizophrenia is caused by multiple factors!" This was one study that implied *maybe* that's true. And you're trusting one person's interpretation of the results section of the paper. So your options are pretty bleak.   I have recommendations for books and stuff if you want to PM me, but psychology is a hard hobby to take up and do well. You really need to immerse yourself in the research and read a lot. I only know what I know from it being my passion and field of study. Hope this helped.  ||||| [URL]  [URL]   ||||| [URL]  Essential resource for any NT  (specifically neuroscience here: [URL] ) ||||| Ow.

7321	1,3,3,3	6	Hey folks! I hope this is the right place to put something like this...  if not, please gently guide my way!  Here in a few weeks I'm hosting a dinner party with a spy theme to it.  ***  Intrigue! Mystery! Suspicion!  It's the year 19XX. The legendary spy Juan Headlight has given his life to disseminate information on the evil Dr. Golytely and his plans to take over the world. The first ever International Intelligence and Information Institute (4-I's) convention was established for three rival spy agencies to convene and put a stop to his madness.  M.E.R.D.E. - Ministry of Espionage, Recon and Deterring Enemies. H.O.N.K. - Headquarters of New Komrades. D.o.N.G. - Division of National Guardians.  The three agencies need to put a stop to Dr. Golytely's plot (who will surely try and sabotage the 4-I's convention)... if they're not too busy trying to undermine each others efforts!  Players play as spies split into teams called Agencies. Players are not aware of each others allegiances until the game ends. Each player will have a different role that gives them special abilities to help figure out who belongs to what agency. For instance, an Analyst may be able to find out information on other players, or a Fabricator could place a burn order on a spy, causing their agency to disavow them.  Each player and agency has their own objectives they must complete, from solving puzzles to learning information about other players/agencies. However, the threat of Dr. Golytely looms; if the players don't put a stop to him, all players lose! How much are you willing to risk for your agency? Can you really trust anyone?  ***  While the secrecy and hidden role game is probably better for another subreddit, what I'm looking for is a little help towards the good doctor's plans for world domination. In previous games like this I'll have puzzles and ciphers and things strewn about that players can solve for bonuses, but in this case it's much more linear--the group will need to solve them all to prevent the game from ending on a bad note. Once they solve puzzle A, puzzle B gets presented, and so on.  Some ideas I have: - I have some friends at the local telecom company that will hook me up with a phone number that they can call to receive a pre-recorded message. Figuring out the phone number would be fun but I'm worried that they might call the wrong number. - I can set up a short-range AM ham radio (possibly) that can replicate a numbers station. - I can have ciphers and codes abound, using one-time pads to be solved, but I don't want this to be the only focus; variety is the spice of life and all that. - I have several cabinets and end tables I can put padlocks on for cracking numbers.

5098	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	I'm going to buy my first handgun next month after I get my bonus. I've been around guns my whole life, mostly rifles, but we had a 22 revolver when I was a kid. I'm thinking about a Glock 19. What type of ammo is the cheapest and most available, 9mm? Do you guys prefer the compact or subcompact models (the sub seems kinda small to me)? Also I live in Baltimore but travel to PA (where all my family is) many times a year. Would it be better to buy it and have it primarily registered in PA over MD? Are there any strange rules about carrying it over state lines? Lots of questions I know, Thanks in advance. ||||| 9mm used to be "the ubiquitous" round, meaning it was easy to find and cheap.  During the Great Ammo Shortage (last 18 months), it was one of the hardest to come by, because everyone newly into guns (meaning a LOT of people) was out there buying 9mm Glocks and hoarding ammo by the case(s).  The price for 9mm has now almost returned to normal, but availability is still sometimes low in regular stores, at least where I am (CA).  It's probably still a worthwhile choice for a caliber, though.  Others will say "for stopping power" get a .45 or minimally a .40; there is still much debate on that point. ||||| The Glock 19 is a good weapon, and an excellent choice for a first weapon, since carry is actually an option due to its size.  For you, given your proximity to NJ, ammoman.com might be a good bet. All prices are quoted as shipped and you should receive your ammo in 1 day. He'll also knock off a few bucks if you pick the stuff up in person.   Just make sure that you get some basic training, and maybe buy some books or DVDs covering basic defensive gun handling. You should practice as much as possible, for example my wife and I shoot about 12 hours per month, which more or less amounts to one afternoon per weekend. Handgun proficiency is difficult to gain, but doing so will make you a much better shooter all around.    I suggest buying a nice, thin, kydex IWB holster. Fist, Inc makes a very nice one that is also adaptable to other types of carry.    Oh, and we don't register guns in Pa, I don't know about Md.   ||||| Make sure to try out a lot of different handguns. Just because someone else likes it doesn't mean it will fit your hand. Glocks have a weird angle between the grip and barrel for my hands, so they aren't comfortable for me. Check out 1911's too, the old standby. Some manufacturers make them in 9mm as well. ||||| The Glock 19 is an excellent pistol if you have big hands. Glocks in general have thick grips and a long trigger reach, which makes it tough for people with medium or small hands (which includes me at 5'8").  The magazines don't always drop free, and their design regularly pinches your hand when seating them. The grip angle is also different than the 1911, which can be a problem for people that shoot both.  I much prefer the S&W M&P, which has a shorter trigger reach and interchangeable backstraps that let you customize the fit. It's a very solid system and won't come loose. The magazines reliably drop free and don't pinch your hand. I also like the lower bore axis, which reduces muzzle flip. I and many others were amazed that S&W produced such a fantastic pistol after decades of shipping crap.  The XD is also pretty good, but it has a higher bore axis and a poorer trigger that's also to be harder to improve. Crap also builds up fairly quickly under the XD's extractor for some reason. Mine has never failed to extract, but the extractor's grip on the case rim is not as positive after a few hundred rounds of dirty ammo.  All of these pistols are relatively easy to conceal. The Glock 17 and M&P Pro get a little big. The mini Glocks, M&Ps, and XDs are significantly harder to shoot well than their mid-sized kin.  I like 9 mm because I can have Wolf 115 gr. delivered to my house for $230 per thousand. The difference between 9 mm, .40, and .45 isn't worth worrying about according to conversations with friends that have used them on others. It comes down to shot placement, and that comes with practice. A central nervous system hit with a 9 mm beats a gut shot with a .45.  And speaking of shot placement, budget for a good pistol class with a reputable instructor. Tuition generally runs around $350.  Can't help you with gun laws. Here in Georgia it's cash & carry. You can't buy booze on Sundays, but you can buy guns. What a state! ||||| Gun laws in MD suck, I think there's something like a 7-day waiting period on a pistol.  Any dealer will be able to tell you the rules when you go to buy.  If you're anywhere near VA, there's a range called Blue Ridge Arsenal, where you can rent guns (not very expensive) and try them out; I'm pretty sure they have a Glock in the cabinet.  The compact and subcompact models are really for conceal carry; yet another problem with MD, you'll have to be good friends with your governor to get one, honest law abiding citizens need-not apply.  I recommend going to a gun show and picking up several different 9mm pistols and seeing which one fits your hand best.  Check out the Springfield XD series, they are very nice.  If you buy the pistol from a dealer, he will require you to show him your driver's license; if you tell him that your "real" address is in Pennsylvania and have a Maryland driver's license, they'll generally tell you to go away. ||||| If you are going to carry the gun a lot then buy something small and light 9mm or even .380.  If it's for home protection then get a shotgun. ||||| You may want to check out the "safe passage" provision of the [Firearm Owners Protection Act]([URL] IANAL, but I believe it may have some bearing on carrying your weapon across state lines. ||||| If your deciding factors are cheapest and most available ammo get a .22.  If you aren't planning on carrying the gun or using it for hunting a .22 is a great gun.  I shoot my Ruger 22/45 more than my other pistols.   ||||| Consider getting the book "[The Traveler's Guide to the Firearm Laws of the Fifty States]([URL] by J. Scott Kappas, Esq., $13.95  ||||| I just got my first handgun in December - a Glock 19.  I absolutely love it.  The grip fits perfectly in my hand.  If you feel that it's too small, try the feel of the  G17.  It's extremely simple, and accurate.  The coolest thing about the 9mm glocks is that you can get a 33rd magazine.  Get Blazer ammo.  It's one of the cheapest.  I've fired 150 rounds of it so far and had 0 hiccups. ||||| 9mm is a fine round.  If you can ind a shooting range in your area that has a good deal on pistol rentals, go through and try everything you might consider buying.   I'd recommend at least shooting a Sig P229, Glock 19, and Springfield XD9 (and/or XD-M in 9mm) if you can.   Figure out which one fits your hand the best and which one you shoot the best (and hope they're the same one).  I ended up getting a Glock 19. ||||| Just a word to the wise: adamantly oppose any sort of mandatory registration you can legally avoid. Including guns. If you can legally purchase a gun somewhere with no paper trail, I think that is in your best interest to do so. I am unfamiliar with the laws in the NE, but I know in Fl we have some very nice gun laws that protect the citizen. Again I do not know the laws of this region, but I suggest obtaining your CCW (I know this is semi contrary to my first statement). In the event you need to explain yourself, showing that you have the "state sanctioned" authorization will likely help. Vermont is the only state that has it right. ||||| If you're interested in the glock, check out the Springfield XD or XDM line.  IMHO a better gun than the Glock.  9MM is easiest on the pocket, but a 45 is more fun;)  Also, check out [URL] If you come to PA through Washington where 79 and 70 intersetct, get off Murtland Ave and stop at Ace Sporting goods.

8353	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	9	There's no midi output on it.  Is that required?  What would be a good drum machine to use with it? ||||| Yes, Sonicstate did it: [URL] ||||| I am curious about this as well, the volca has a 5V sync out which should work with the arpeggiator clock (or the LFO clock) of the brute. Volca also has a midi in. If the midi tempo in and the sync out could work simultaneously seems like that would be really useful. ||||| yes ||||| Sure can, I've been experimenting with that all week actually.  Microbrute, Volca Beats and Volca Bass all connected together with zero MIDI - simply connect a 3.5mm mono cable from the gate out of the Microbrute into the sync in of the Beats or (more commonly) the other way-round.   The only thing to remember is that if the Microbrute is acting as the primary sync and you're not using the sequencer then the Volca is only going to advance through its drum sequence when you play a note - the LFO or the sequencer speed (when it's turned off) won't trigger the Volca. Works exactly as it should, and can even make some pretty neat effects as you manually advance through the pattern, but something to note.   ||||| You can do it, but it's limited. You're not really syncing tempos, you're basically setting it up so that when one machine triggers a note, it also triggers a note on the other machine.  I used to do this with my Monotribe and Minibrute. Might be useful for syncing the Volca Beats to the Microbrute, but I never found it helpful for syncing two melodies; too limited. ||||| You can also do this with an SH-101.
8247	1,3,3,3,3,3	17	Hi,  Yesterday I played a game as Irelia vs Shyvana and I got pushed under tower super hard. I had a hard time counterpushing against her, so lane was always under my tower. I did better in CS (~20 up on her the entire laning phase) and didn't give up any deaths to her. I told my jungler (Poppy) it was a free gank lane as she spent a lot of time with wave under my turret, but Shyv almost always escaped.  I couldn't leave lane because I couldn't push out at all without getting my health chunked and Shyv never had to back unless a gank happened. And because I was always pushed in I couldn't really help my team at all without letting Shyvana push all the way into the base. I tried to create a large wave to go towards their tower but Shyvana's wave clear could just eliminate them quickly and I could not.  What could I have done? ||||| There honestly isn't really a whole lot. Irelia just can't match up in terms of wave clear. Poppy should have spent more time early game getting you snowballed.  I know you said she would frequently escaped, but the 20 CS should have turned into 50-60 if done correctly.  But even with all that, it wouldn't have been guaranteed to have done anything. ||||| If she is constantly pushing hard she is probably slipping and missing some farm while you should be able to get all 6 due to irelia's kit. Just farm it out early game. Later on if she waste's E and your not marked, feel free to fight her like level 7 and on. You can start to brawl her and sustain off the wave.  Being ahead in cs in a 0/0/0 lane is winning. Even if it doesn't make you the "carry" god that you want to be.   ||||| I don't think there's much you could have done imo. Shyv is a top tier champ for top lane while Irelia is pretty weak. Both champions are weak early on but I think Shyv outscales Irelia.  If Irelia has BotRK Tri-Force and Shyv didn't build 2 armor items then you might be able to start winning trades.  ||||| Irelia can kill Shyvana at 5 if you poke a bit beforehand at levels 3-4.  That's what you *need to do* if you don't want to fall behind. Pushing him out of lane is alright too if you fail to kill. ||||| hydra is not a bad item on irelia (even proccs on the q) if this helps you waveclear quickly withou having to ult it might be an alright pickup. also, if youre under turret using W to lasthit them all can be better for your mana than spamming Q in most cases.  and as said before, max W and trade whenever she misses her E
9442	1,3,3,3,3	5	I currently have a weekly income (rent money) and a monthly income (job). I'm just starting out with YNAB and I'm budgeting this month's paycheck with this month.  My problem is I haven't collected all the weekly payments from rent at the start of the month so it isn't available to budget.  Is it a good idea to have negative funds available to budget until the 4th payment is made from rent?  Or should I not have this as income but rather as a contribution to the mortgage category? But again that has the issue of me being over budget until all the weekly collections have been taken.  I understand I start using YNAB more that the income from this rent should be used to pay the mortgage for the following month ||||| When starting out, the best approach is to budget when new money comes in. So this is the sequence:  - Set up accounts with your current balances. - Put money in the 'budget' column of your CC so that your 'Available' equals your CC balance on the left. This is to pay off the balance you carried into YNAB - you won't have to do this next month. - Look at your 'To be budgeted' - that's how much you have to work with - Budget this amount to immediately pressing categories until you get to $0. Stop. Understand what you can't afford right now until you get more money. - Live to this budget. If you overspend somewhere, move money around to cover it. - When your next income comes in, budget again to $0. - If you manage to cover all your monthly budget categories, flip to the next month and continue budgeting there. - The goal is to get to the point where this month's income is paying for next months expenses.  You don't want negative funds in any category - that indicates you are spending money you don't have, or adding to your CC debt.  As an example, my mortgage payment is bi-weekly. I fund half of the amount from the prior month's income, and the  second half of it when my mid-month pay arrives.  BTW, how often you sync-up and make sure you're spending according to budget depends on how much spending you do. I usually sync-up my transactions twice a week to make sure I'm on track. ||||| >Is it a good idea to have negative funds available to budget until the 4th payment is made from rent?  No. You should budget only with money you have. When the rent checks come in, ask yourself "what does this money need to do until I get paid (income) again."   Don't budget with money you don't actually have - that's monopoly money & you should not base your spending decisions on monopoly money.  Good luck & Happy Budgeting! ||||| Never budget with money you don't have, budget according to what you need the money to do until you get paid again. If you have enough leftover then you can sit it in a category for a bill 2 weeks from now, a month from now, or ten years from now. ||||| Only budget the money actually in your account(s). Start by budgeting for the bills that will come due before you next expect to get income. nYNAB helps with this by the way it groups and sorts the budgets. So if you expect those BOM rent checks to all come in by the end of the week, budget for expenses you'll have through Friday. If you have to make a mortgage payment on the 26th then don't budget for it now. Wait until you have the funds to pay for it but you don't have any more immediate expenses.
1934	1,3,3,3,3	17	I'm currently using mouse/keyboard and was wondering if somebody has compared them. If so, please tell me if you felt like you had a disadvantage using keyboard/mouse ||||| Yes use a controller  ||||| I use a keyboard/mouse and I suck at the game :( ||||| I've played with both a controller and keyboard+mouse and I'd say they are equal. I haven't found any in-game advantages to either one.  I only prefer the keyboard+mouse combo because it is easier on my hands during longer play sessions. ||||| There is no disadvantage. I got a DS4 and play at the same level i do with keyboard. You just have to get used to it.   The one thing i don't like are the standard keyboard/mouse bindings. When it comes to fancy arerial shots(air controll) the standard bindings are not that good because you accelerate with W but also pitch down your front while in the air. If you keep holding W in the air you'll make front flips all the time, feels weird.   Because of this i use keyboard only. WASD + arrow keys for air controll, boost on CTRL and jump on spacebar.   Feels perfect and you get used to it pretty fast.

2035	1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,3	40	As of late I've been seeing this happen more and more. We get it, they're casuals. But just because you're a ranked player going into casuals doesn't give you the right to walk up to the enemy team and spam taunt them until they kill you.   "Just because it's casuals" doesn't mean that the casual players don't want to win, either. Simply because we don't play ranked doesn't mean we're worse players, it doesn't mean that we want to lose all the time and it doesn't mean that you have the right to troll your entire team on that basis.  So please, if you're one of these players, I beg of you, change your mentality and look at it from our point of view.   Sincerely, the casual player.  ||||| [URL] ||||| [deleted] ||||| As a Silver II, I agree that ranked sometimes act like master race when going "down" on casuals and its really annoying. But what I also hate is when I am trying stuff out and I get yelled at. Like I am not troll, I just try things out and Imma do my best... ||||| There is a difference between "doing whatever we want" and "doing whatever we want".  If I wanna try something like Sobek jungle, I will do it in casuals but think twice before doing it in ranked. I will however try to win. Spam taunting to just get freekilled is not fine however and probably reportable anyway. ||||| I just played with a guy who gets out called by solo. When given the only option to support he said "lol I'm not supporting in casual" and dodged the lobby. Checked his profile and turns out he's only in Gold V. I hate this its only casual mentality. ||||| Once in casual conquest (Which I have to play since I'm not level 30 yet) I experienced someone like this. I was mid as Scylla, my friend was jungling as Nemesis. We had this Tyr in the solo, and by gods, he was the WORST. After going to the mid harpies, he first says "lol mid wards? wtf casuals" Yeah I know that mids don't usually buy wards but when nobody else does, NOT EVEN THAT TYR, I'm not gonna let my team be totally blind. After the harpies I go back to the mid lane, Tyr goes into solo. I notice him die almost immediately, then he starts going off on our jungler (my friend) for not ganking the enemy team while he was still clearing out the camps, acting like his death was solely my junglers fault and nothing else. At this point we're less than two minutes in, he gets done ranting and goes "**** this casual bull****" and disconnects. LESS THAN TWO FREAKING MINUTES IN. Everyone reported him after, hope he gets some kind of punishment.  ||||| I've come across many casual players who surpass many ranked players in terms of skill.  The mentality many ranked players hold is disgusting.    Many of them think that just because it's "casual" everyone must be bad because they don't play ranked.  And in ranked they automatically view qualifying players as bad when that qualifying player can actually carry the team to victory  Long story short, casual =/= bad ||||| i stopped play league cause the time between casual and him was 5 time longer, every 2 match people say ''pls 10 surrend'' just for a guy that was 1-3.  get 11 and lose 7 point and wen you hit 100, every time it was a surrend ||||| There's having fun in casuals, and there's feeding.. ||||| Works both ways. While I agree with everything you said, it is true that casuals are the place where you can try out new stuff and have fun. While you shouldn't feed or troll, you are allowed to try out stuff that others might find weird or stupid. So basically you shouldn't complain if someone decides to go Zeus hunter until you see him play, because the chances are he is seriously trying to make it work.   ||||| I agree with this i play casuals so i can team up with my friends, But i play ranked when they are not online and that is the only time i play ranked, and how i play is the same in both modes ||||| People who say that casual is for trying new things are kind of right, try new things are what jungleefully practise and bot games are for. "Well that's new the same as a real game so you can't do that bla bla bla", True it's not the same thing but it will let you know how good a character is at clearing camps, what you should build and how etc etc. ||||| If you're a casual player then why do you get mad at this? You are taking it serious... ||||| [empty] ||||| It's casual, it doesn't matter what you do either your team has a feeder/rager/dc or the enemy team does.  From my experience playing strictly casuals until next ranked season (because ranked matchmaking is aids atm) casual players mostly hate winning - they don't ward, they don't look at the map, they don't try to work together as a team by rotating. All they do is lane for half an hour then run around the map trying to get kills.  OR they lane for 10 minutes and die 17 times because staying alive is just too fucking difficult.  the worst part THE worst part about casuals is that there's always that one guy who doesn't call a preferred role fast enough and is then put in support AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A FUCKING CLUE, ymir every game with fucking watcher's gift and boots 1 - first blood in 40 seconds. You're sitting over in solo as the jungler or solo laner like "well how the fuck was i supposed to influence that". THEN, he just sits in lane the entire game, either feeding or just not doing anything productive. As a support main i've started explaining in the lobby that a support should load out with 3 health and 3 mana potions to survive till mid camps.  They....just....hate...winning  I fully agree that casual conquest should be a place to go to practice mechanically or new strategies and get better for ranked - i often play xbalanque in casuals (low tier according to DIMbrandon) trying different items to start with to see if it improves his early laning.  So please, if you're one of these players (which 99% of the population are, and none of them read the reddit) learn the game, play well and stop being a fucking casual.  ||||| I don't get why people can't try new things in co-op....

7679	1,3	4	So I'm a rising senior, currently SAS (econ) but I found out today that I was accepted as a transfer into the business school for finance. I was originally RBS directly from high school, but I was booted at the end of sophomore year for failing a stat class... I reapplied this past February and was reaccepted. Basically, I'm on track to graduate on time (May 2016) if I stick with SAS econ, but if I switch to RBS finance I'll be a semester and a summer behind.   My GPA is a touch under 3.5, and I figure an extra semester for finance might help me boost it. My parents are willing to financially support me. Also, I could potentially find a legit internship for the summer of 2016 and leverage it into a full time offer by that winter if I graduate with a BS in finance. My other (current) option is to graduate on time with econ, but with little full-time contacts or prospects. Also, I enjoy finance more and IMO it's more practical to go into private sector, but I could see why others would like econ for policy and academia.  Econ professors I've taken the past semester have been sub-par, and I enjoyed the conceptual aspects of the intro classes, but the upper-level content definitely doesn't mesh with my interests or aptitudes.  Thanks in advance. If any RBS students or econ majors could include pros/cons and your own career goals as well that would be much appreciated.. ||||| I actually just graduated as a double major in Marketing and Economics. I know some people who for one reason or another weren't in RBS but pursued Econ as an alternative to Finance as well as others who doubled majored in Econ and Finance. For them, Econ complimented their Finance degree. I do agree with you that some Econ professors aren't amazing. My friends who majored in Finance talked a lot about really liking some of their professors, so there is a plus side in that. RBS also has a lot of resources with career management, I'm not too familiar with what SAS offers actually since I entered Rutgers as an RBS student.    In my experience with the job hunt, many recruiters for Finance entry level positions (like middle/back office) were looking for non Finance majors actually to get a more diverse group of employees. I got a full time offer in a finance job but beyond Into to Financial Management I've never taken a Finance class. For me, it was a combination of networking and having a relevant internship to financial services. However, If you're dead set on working in a front office role, then I would recommend going for Finance.    If it's a possibility, I'd say to pursue both majors but if you're not looking to stay that long I think you could be able to do fine as an Economics major. You can use this year to look for a job- why do you say you have little to no prospects for one? Go on CareerKnight and apply for as many jobs as you can. Ask your friends/network. Keep in mind that, if you do drop Econ for Finance, that not all companies could extend you a full time offer upon completion of your internship regardless of how great an intern you were. Also, it's great that you want to bump your GPA to a 3.5 but again, in my experience your GPA isn't going to be a large part of the hiring decision unless it's really really bad. A plus to going for your major in Finance would be that there's probably better professors and you could buy more time into developing your professional network. There's a lot of pros either way, it's really up to you how serious/passionate you are about finance!

7748	1,3,3,3	4	I have never, smoke, drank, or used drugs but I have a few questions. I know that the addiction rate for using marijuana is very low, but I may have a bit of a problem here. My family has a history of alcoholism, my father, my grandfather, and my great grandfather were all prone to alcoholism. I have made the choice not to drink because I know that there is a pretty high chance that It will lead me down a bad road. I have a few friends who smoke weed, and have been invited over to smoke before, but I have always declined. I was wondering if addiction to alcohol correlates with addiction to weed. I know that neither of those substances are addicting by themselves, but if a person is prone to addiction it could lead to addictions. I don't even know if I'm posting this in the right place, but I feel like I have no one else to talk to about it. I know Reddit's opinions may be very pro marijuana, but if you guys could look at my situation from an objective standpoint it would be greatly appreciated. It would also be nice to just hear from other who can sympathize with my situation. I know that drinking alcohol is out of the question for me, but would it be a bad choice to try marijuana? ||||| I think that they are the same for the adictive personality. Pot does less short term damage to your body, but perhaps more long term damage to your brain. I would avoid both given your genetics. ||||| Smoking and drinking in moderation is fine. Only you yourself know enough to make a decision whether or not you can handle it in moderation. I come from a family of alcoholics, but I am able to drink and smoke without it being a problem. ||||| Honestly, I'm not sure its for you.   Weed might not be physically addicting, but its certainly habitual and psychologically addictive. I know plenty of people hooked on weed, myself included. The tricky part about it is its much easier to get by on a weed addiction than a liquor one, as its less taxing for your health and after a month of regular smoking and its pretty possible to function even if you're getting high regularly. I have a friend who has been high, essentially, for five years straight. He does okay - he's in college, gets good grades, has friends. But weed for many people takes over as a hobby and lifestyle... And God. Its expensive once you really get into it. That said, as far as addictions go, its not the worse.  Check out /r/leaves and make a decision after.

1379	1,3,3,3,2,2,3,3	13	My roommates bought me a home brew kit (Brooklyn beer shop to be specific) for Christmas and it went awesome. I recently decided I wanted to brew again so I picked up a box of ingredients from a local home brew store.   The ingredients and instructions call for a 6.5 gallon fermenter and other large sized things that I don't have. But I do have a 1 gallon fermenter and other pots around the house suitable for that sized brew.   My question is can I cut the larger recipe down to fit my current equipment without tarnishing the quality of the brew? And how could I best do so? ||||| You can get a larger bucket at the hardware store for <$20. If you have a pot that can boil around 3 gallons, you can top off with sterilized water and you're good to go.  ||||| you can insert the recipe here: [URL]  and than click on recipe tools > scale (or something like that).   ||||| Yes when it comes to brewing you can just increase or decrease the quantities in proportion and the quality won't change. So just divide everything equally.   However, since you enjoyed your first brew and have the ingredients I'd recommend buying a 6.5 gallon fermenter, 1 gallon hardly makes it worth it, IMO. I also recommend getting a nice big pot - as big as you can get (8 gallons+) but at least 5 gallons. ||||| List out your ingredient and we could maybe get a better picture. Brew recipes generally scale fantastically if it's stuff like extract, grains, and hops.

1439	1,3,3,3,3,3	19	I'm a big fan of the Hardcore History podcast and there's an episode about Martin Luther and the Catholic reformation and the consequence of translating the Bible, which was not public for the masses, and translated into German, the common language. This allowed for commoners to know what the Bible said, as well as question the authority of the church as to why they had X as a practice when the Bible says otherwise. What I want to know is if there is any documentation or commentary regarding this from the Jewish perspective? Did Jews in Germany also read the German Bible because they didn't know how to read the Torah in Hebrew? Did Rabbi's have to squelch a Jewish uproar about things being hidden from them? I'm curious what, if any, response the Jewish world brought to that moment of history.  ||||| In general traditional rabbinic Judaism encourages a horizontal society, the more educated the masses are in Torah the better off we all are. Indeed Hazal authorized an official Aramaic targum (translation) and deemed it a weekly obligation to review alongside of a double reading of the weekly portion. Indeed in a case of lifeboat ethics, a mamzer who transformed himself into a Talmid Hakham takes priority over that of a Kohen! Traditional rabbinic Judaism does not generally see a proper Torah education as threatening. Quite the contrary it sees it as a strength and indeed personal obligation.   That said, I don't know if there was any rabbinic response to Luther's translation however a better testcase would be Mendelssohn's translation. There was indeed some rabbinic opposition to it on the grounds that a) it was written in a very technical German rather than in a style more accessible to the masses and b) it could become too much of a crutch and may prevent people from pursuing a proper understanding of the text in the native Hebrew. As you can see in both reasons for opposition the concern was not that the Jewish masses will become too educated but to the contrary that they will not be sufficiently educated. ||||| I suspect that Jews who knew about Luther's Reformation had [bigger fish to fry]([URL] at that time.  There were many earlier translations, as others have mentioned. And my understanding is that Judaism was always opposed to translating the Torah, but not because we didn't want people to understand it.  As /u/Deuteronomy said, Moses Mendelssohn's translation would probably be the Jewish equivalent. Mendelssohn is often regarded as the grandfather of the Reform movement, and his translation (which was meant to show that Judaism can be relevant to modern, civilised German[ Jew]s) was part of that.  However, Rabbi SR Hirsch, who came a generation or two later, and is the most famous leader of the anti-Reform movements did not advocate  that the masses should not learn Torah, but that fluency in Hebrew, and thus an ability to study the Torah *on one's own*, should be the first and most important concern of Jewish education, which was not an innovation, because basic literacy has been a Halachically responsibility on the cothreatenednce the late Tannaic period, at least (he also advocated for education in 'secular' literacy and general culture, which was more controversial, but only after an ability to learn Torah had been achieved).  In short, while translating the Torah has been/is controversial, the Rabbinic establishment has never been threatened by widespread study of Torah, and there's never been an attempt or a desire to suppress an uproar about access to education, it's been the opposite, the Rabbinic establishment has been consistent in its desire for *more* people to engage directly with Jewish tradition and Jewish texts, and has consistently fought against apathy and indifference to what the Torah actually says.  One small counterpoint: the traditional view is that Torah study is an elite activity, and people must enter into it with prerequisite characters development and respect (see, for example, Rambam, Hilchot Talmud Torah, chapter 4). I don't think there's ever been a rebellion against this principle (and if anything, we have tended to err on the side of promoting education), but it could be taken as a limitation of the study of Torah for the "masses". But of course, this is not an inherent quality, but one which the prospective student is able and expected to change. ||||| Torah study is a basic obligation binding on every Jew. There is also a specific obligation to ensure a Jewish education for all Jewish children. Literacy in Hebrew was a basic norm, for both men and women, throughout history, as was a strong familiarity with the Hebrew Scriptures. The Torah is read publicly every week, together with a selection from the Prophets, and there are special readings of other books on certain holidays (e.g. Esther on Purim). Yiddish, Ladino, and Arabic translations and commentaries were published for the benefit of those who did not understand Hebrew (especially women), and many of these works (e.g. Tzena Ur'ena, Me'am Lo'ez) became extremely popular.  So the entire controversy in Christianity over making the Bible available to the masses had no parallel in Judaism, as the Hebrew Bible has always been open to the entire Jewish population and everyone has always been encouraged to study it. ||||| I don't know of any specific reaction to Luther or the German translation itself, but I wouldn't think there would be a strong Jewish analogy in this case. At its core, Judaism doesn't treat the Torah as an "elite" text. Jews have always encouraged religious education for everyone. Near-universal elementary education in traditional communities  (for males at least) would have consisted of learning to read and understand the Torah, in Hebrew, with commentaries.  Additionally, there have been many translations of the Torah into "everyday language" over the centuries: the various Aramaic Targumim and the Septuagint (Greek) in antiquity, plus Sa'adiah Gaon's translation (Arabic) in the Middle Ages. Rashi and Rambam (late Middle Ages) didn't translate the Torah, but used local languages to help explain it.  Some rabbinic texts express ambivalence about translations, for various reasons, but the overall goal of making Torah understandable to the (Jewish) masses generally wins out.  ||||| Luther is a weird guy in general, in his earlier works he seems to like Jews and at some point he just goes 180° and writes von der jüden und ihre lügen. He advocated burning the schuls and sforim and convert the lot and wanted Jews to be happy about it, a really vile look into the mind of a rabid antisemite centuries before things really went south Germany.

From the fact that you're playing Autumn Leaves (a fine song and one I play as well) and unsure about other pieces, I'm guessing (and I don't mean this as an insult in the least) that you don't have the repitiore to be in that top 5%. **This isn't a bad thing**. Just means that you can basically just slide through by playing almost anything as long as you play it right and with competence. You don't need to play Giant Steps in 12 keys to do this. You have 5 weeks, so you should pick a piece you can learn in 2-4 settings and work the rest of the time on perfecting it.   For the jazz piece, I'd do something fairly easy (and fun) like Take 5 by Dave Brubeck. Here's a guy doing it on nylon string guitar. If you can get to the point that you can honestly play it as well as the guy in this video, I promise you'll get in the school (unless you're applying to Juliard, for which I can offer no advice). [URL]  For the classical piece, choose something fairly basic by Mozart, Bach or Beethoven. Sounds boring, but again, you're just showing that you can play a piece and play it well.  I should stress that it is significantly better imho to play a 'simple' song incredibly well than have any chance of blowing a single note on a complex piece in an audition setting for university.   Or at least this advice got me into and through Berklee. Good luck!   ||||| Classical Gas, by Mason Williams. Easily my favorite classical piece... ||||| [Just play Autumn Leaves with 2 guitars and you will get in just fine]([URL] ||||| Well, are you going for Jazz or Classical. I'm a Jazz guitar major and you have to make a distinction. I can give you some advice for both, but you have to know there is no in between major.
9428	1,3,3	9	Quick question here,  My buddy has LAN parties every couple of weeks and this weekend we're playing Gears of War 3. With backwards compatibility now available would I have any problems with playing system link with people who are mainly using Xbox 360's? About half of us have 360's and the other half have both 360's and XBones, so if we could take advantage of having both systems and just needing extra copies of the game that would be awesome. ||||| According to [this]([URL] you can. Your best bet is to just try it out. ||||| I'm a big system link guy too. System link works perfectly between xbox 360 and xbox one. For Gears of War 3 however, there have been several title updates, and all your systems need to be on the same title update. To ensure this, you'll need to have all systems connected to xbox live and update the latest updates. If any of your xbox 360s are offline only consoles, then it'll be difficult / impossible to do.
5544	1,3,3	7	Okay, so I've searched and found nothing on this one. I got FolderIcons, which is great, and all the ones I've downloaded from Cydia work fine. However, when I try to put my own images in, they show as completely blown up (almost 4x a normal icon size). I've edited the pictures to be 120x120 like all the others, but it still shows this behavior...any idea what needs to change?  ||||| Well 6+ icons are 180x180 (60x3), make sure you use @3x instead of @2x also ;) ||||| I having the same trouble here on a 5s. I have used photoshop to scale down the images to 70x70 which is a quick fix for now. 
2293	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	12	Is there a way or someplace to get/buy stems of songs (the elements that make it up, seperately) so i can make my own remix..? ||||| An official remix is usually done through contacting the label or artist or the remixer getting contacted by the artist or label.  For bootlegs you just take the song as it is, cut it and mess with it as it is to do whatever with it. ||||| From the people who made the song and decided to release the stems, of course. ||||| I recently discovered Beatport, a lot of DJ's hang out there. They recently released stems to Tegan and Sara's "Closer" for a remix competition.  ||||| They mostly either get the stems directly from the artist, as some producers are paid to remix songs or have connections with the artists/labels, or through remix competition. Some producers also EQ out everything but the parts they want and make there own stems/accapellas, but this is very hard and doesn't sound as good. ||||| Keep your eyes on beatport. They usually have 2-3 remix comps going on at any given time in which you can download the stems ||||| [Tell 'em Large Marge sent ya]([URL] (Don't actually do that.)  While they don't have as many stems being posted as they used to (mostly just requests now), it never hurts to ask, as a lot of people there collect/hoard stems......like I do. Also, whenever a large collection of stems is released, that's typically where I hear it first. Then occasionally there's other redditors who post their own stems there, so it opens up more avenues of collaboration.   ||||| Most of them just work off of the actual song. ||||| lol.  you need to be in contact with the creator of the track - if yr paying for them...idk what to say to you..

I absolutely loathe playing against Dark Worlds though. I don't think anything annoys me more than fucking with my hand.  Oh, and Exodia decks.  ||||| I don't care about playing exodia, its Dark World running 3 Dragged Down that gets me. Love having a hand to win next turn and then my BLS and Honest is taken away >_>  ||||| Read this and was like damn dude /u/slwy and this guy would be friends.

4341	1,3,0	13	"Concerning the course taken by the United States they have the liberty a right to reject this law themselves, as they have the liberty a right to reject the Gospel; but it is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, for them to prohibit you from obeying it. Therefore abide in my law which I have revealed unto you, saith the Lord God, and contend for your rights by every legal and constitutional method and in accordance with the institutions, laws, and Constitution of the United States."   (Manuscript in John Taylor Papers, LDS archives, typed copy)  To be very clear here, God is saying that forbidding Polygamy is "unconstitutional"  [A discussion of the constitutionality of anti-polygamy laws at the time]([URL]  [The legal side that says that it is unconstitutional (long filled with legalese and for fun, uses a homosexual case to back up that polygamy should be legal.]([URL]  I think this sums it up best: [URL]  God needs to get a better lawyer. ||||| I wouldn't mind having polygamy be legal, as long as underage girls aren't being taken advantage of. Because there isn't much difference between a guy with two wives and three roomates where only one is a guy. But.. I think a maximum of maybe five wives. And maybe one child each? Overpopulation sucks. Technically, we can be polygamist genetically, because if you have a kid, get divorced, and have another, then you're still contributing to the gene pool genetically with two women. :P ||||| The context here is that religion is not what is being debated, it's that polygamy is illegal regardless of religion.    Religion doesn't even factor into it.  The states can make it legal or illegal at their discretion.  So if they made it legal, no biggie for the constitution.  As well, the constitution does not protect it.  Sadly, God doesn't seem to get that, despite authoring the constitution.
6979	1,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,2,3	17	I'm graduating with a BA in May with some solid professional and volunteer experience. I have the potential to be accepted into all three of these programs by the summer.   JET is a paid teaching program conducted through the Japanese embassy, that would send me to Japan to teach full time. Teach for America is also a paid position, a teacher's salary, that places teachers in schools in rough locations, whether rural or urban, throughout the USA. A day-job basically, but with no need for a teaching degree. And then, of course, you all know about the Peace Corps.   Which one to choose? Is Peace Corps still worth more than the others, despite it offering very little money? What does it offer that the other programs don't? I'd like to think it'd be more exciting and give me more independence/freedom. Is that a correct assumption?  I want to do one of these programs rather than just going out and searching for a career. At 22 years old, I'm not even close to being ready to settle down.    I don't mind having no money, but I also wouldn't mind having a little bit for the first time in my life. Not to mention I've got 15,000 in student loans to pay back someday. What do you all think?   UPDATE: Teach for America just informed me that I can still be accepted for a position in their program, and can defer that position until after I complete my Peace Corps service. So I will be moving forward with their application process as well.  ||||| I'm a current JET now in Fukui Prefecture. This is my second year here.  I like it a lot and my lifestyle is good. I get paid well and up until the election last month, the exchange rate has been great for sending money back to the USA to pay loans(25K remaining).   However, I was also an Edu PCV in Kazakhstan. I did that first and found that to be a much more rewarding experience than what I do now even though my life was harder. Being an RPCV, it was very easy for me to get accepted to JET because one of the things they want is someone committed to fulfilling their contract. The know if you did the PC you can put up with a lot of bullshit. You also have the freedom to affect your community however you want. If you only want to work on your primary job and hang out, you can. If you want to take on thirty second projects, you can. It's up to you. The JET program puts a lot of money into you if you start working for them. In JET, I feel more like a hired gun, anyone can do my job as long as they know English. Sure, I am molding the young minds of Japan as much as I can but while I was in the PC I felt like I impacted the whole community. I learned the language quickly and met tons of people. I had many local friends and became steeped in the culture. In Japan, about 2/3 of my friends are ex-pats. Also, here in Japan, teachers change so frequently that the students don't really attempt to bond unless it's their homeroom teacher. The teachers are required to move schools every few years.    My advice is: if you want to be a PCV, the money won't matter. And as a PCV, you learn to live on little. Here in Japan I know I save more because I was able to live on so little while I was a PCV. There are plenty of fun things to do with little money as a PCV and you can save some of your monthly allowance (I was able to give up buying some things like meat and gave up Internet access so I could get a few plane tickets for vacations). The personal rewards from PC are worth it in my opinion  One last thing: Most JETs are "human tape-recorders" in a JHS, my PC experience got me a job in a SHS and the ability to teach my own classes independently and have my own homeroom class. This is not normal among JETs (the homeroom part). ||||| Peace Corps has better training for volunteers than anywhere else, so you'll learn a lot more about the locals.  JET pays well. (VERY well).  I don't know much about TFA. ||||| This is a question you have to ask yourself. Do you have any clue what you want to do as a career? If you want to do international development/non-profit/federal gov work, do Peace Corps. If you don't have a passionate reason to join the Peace Corps, go for JET (or EPIK!) and pay off your student loans. If you want to be a teacher, go for TFA. You don't say anything about why you're interested in Peace Corps, so do you think you can tough it out in some third world country for 27 months making very little money when you have little motivation to be there?  ||||| Not sure if I am way late to the program; but here it goes  Peace Corps gives you training and teaches you the language. You become part of the community and have access to do grants and are trained on how to do projects. (people have mentioned the impact you can have in Peace Corps so I won't go to much into it)  So if you want to feel like you are doing good work and have professional challenges do peace corps.  (I've had several close friends that did JET) This program seems more like, here's a steady job and good pay your in a foreign country, have fun. Your assignments usually  aren't that cool and you don't do lots of side projects you just kinda go to work and come back.  BUT you have good pay and you are in a foreign land. So if you want to travel site see, meet random people on your own (not professorially) this for you. In peace corps with the pay it was somewhat limiting to the kinds of things I wanted to do, Actually I loved my host country so much I'm going back with money so I can enjoy it even more. In jet you will be able to do this the first time around.  Finally TFA (had 2 close friends do this... we are all free spirits okay! Leave us alone, most of have real jobs now....) It's really hard work. You have to really love teaching and kids. You deal with a lot of crap. A lot. Pay is good and you get a $5K (maybe $10K) education award to pay of your loans. If you want to be a teacher you can also get a free masters. Looks great on resumes.  ||||| Also important to consider is the alumni network. RPCVs will open doors for you. TFA alumni will do the same. PLus you can always do both of those. JET alumni.... honestly not sure. Worth looking into.   Secondly, most federal student loans will get deferred during PC service. That being said, are you really considering these three options and you're concerned about pay? I had $18K in loans...it's not that big of a deal.  Finally, PC service gives you some time to work on other stuff, like your writing, gives a new perspective on things, and at least for me some cRaZy stories to tell. I would disagree that you need to have a clear career path before joining PC - I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life, but got a lot of great ideas from my service.   Hope that helps. You'll get 3 x a million different perspectives on this. Good luck!  ||||| I picked Peace Corps because I wasn't 100% sure I wanted to be a teacher and I thought PC could be sort of a 2 year trial run to see if I liked it (I do).  If I hadn't liked it, the worst case scenario would have been I had the experience of a lifetime and something that looked good on a resume. ||||| It seems to me that the Peace Corps would open more potential doors for you career wise than the other two options. If you don't know what you ultimately want to do and aren't concerned with money, that seems like the better way to go.  ||||| Have you started the PC application process yet? Because that might factor into your decision process. Just remember that the entire process will most likely take (if everything goes right) at least 9 months from start to finish.  ||||| You should shoot /user/alesair/ a message. He served in JET before doing Peace Corps. I think both are awesome experiences. I would lean toward recommending JET/PC over TFA because you get international exposure and getting out of America can really give you a new and interesting perspective.

Any feedback would be sweet! ||||| I've never painted a death guard scheme, but I am very fond of nurgly things.  With that said, Pallid Wych Flesh layered over Rakarth Flesh might be a good sickly cream color for their primary, with death world forest / nurgling green for their sickly green shoulderpads.  use nulin oil only in the detailed areas, followed with a full wash of athonian camoshade, topped with dry brush of terminatus stone sounds like a decent pallet  ||||| Fluff-wise, the Death Guard are very bland with their colours, choosing muted greens and greys, so if you're trying to keep the army accurate to the lore I would avoid bright colours. I don't know what else to say really. Paint them diarrhea green? ||||| I play 30K Death Guard. For the white Pallid Wych Flesh is great. For the green I use a 1:1 mix of Castellan Green and Elysian Green.  For the grime I go a little different. AK Interactive do some excellent streaking effect enamels. I use their rust streaking for tanks and light armour, and then their Dark slime streaking effect to Nurgle up.  Finishing up with a little Rot.

3134	1,3,3,3,3	6	Recently, my son has gotten mobile, and as such he can now climb in my lap and pull down my shirt and eat whenever he wants. I love this, and I think it's great.   However, I'm wondering (and this is possibly a really stupid question) if he's emptying my breasts more often, will my body start to produce more in order to satisfy him? He's 8 months old now.   Like I said, it could be a stupid question, but I'm genuinely curious. I know that now that he's mobile, he's burning more calories and so most likely need more. Right??  ||||| Your milk is constantly changing. If he's eating more, you'll make more, if he's eating less, you'll make less. Also, your body knows just the right nutrients and antibodies baby needs. When he was newborn, your body made nutrient-dense colostrum, and now that he's older, your body made adjustments to suit his needs. Toddler milk is different than newborn milk, which is different than other womens' milk (but not so much that it would affect nursing someone else's baby) and so on. Our bodies are amazing things! ||||| I'd like to know the answer, also. I don't think it's a stupid question at all. People always say it's a supply/demand system, but also stress the first 2-3 months so much for building up your supply that it makes it seem like you're set at that point.  ||||| It all works on supply and demand :) he demands more the body will supply more(generally) and the milk will change to fit baby's needs as he/she grows.

6150	1,3,3,3,3	7	A little backstory: Up until about 4 years ago, I was very physically active. After I quit playing basketball, I began gaining weight and eventually got to be about 165 lbs. (for reference I'm 5'4"/18/F). Over the years I've tried to start exercising, but never stuck to it. Last Fall I started eating healthier and portioning my meals, and about 3 months ago I began doing 10 minute workouts every day before work, and I'm so happy with the results. I've lost almost 35 lbs.   This morning I decided to go for a run, something I haven't done in at least two years. The last time I tried running I was out of breath within two blocks, got awful cramps, and nearly pooped my pants (no, really). Needless to say, I hated it.   So this morning I wasn't very excited to start running, but after consistently working out and seeing that progress CAN be made (it may happen slowly, but it will happen) I told myself that I would at least try it. Long story short, I ran about a mile without wanting to give up halfway through. In fact, *I wanted to keep going*, just to see how far I could get. Sure, it probably wasn't the prettiest or fastest run ever, but just the fact that I did it and liked it feels incredible.   I can't describe how relieved I am to finally be back to the point where things like running don't absolutely exhaust me. This is such a huge victory, and I just wanted to share it with folks who may be going through something similar.  Don't give up, keep working hard, and I promise that you will get to the point where running (or whatever exercise you hate) doesn't suck anymore. It's worth working toward. Thanks for reading!  ||||| I remember that moment. Getting moving again is such a challenge. Finding that moment of enjoyment is so important. We aren't made for these sedentary lives, we're made to run, jump, climb, and pick up heavy things.  ||||| Be careful with running. It becomes addictive very easily! Soon you will be signing up for 5ks lol. Awesome work!! ||||| That's freaking amazing! I'm somebody who hates running too and I think most of it comes from having overly high and unrealistic expectations of myself for my first run.  I'm beginning to think that running takes baby steps :) I hope you can keep up your amazing work! Would you be willing to share what kind of workouts you've been doing?  ||||| That's awesome! I love running too, even though I still have a lot of weight left to lose. I'm glad you didn't wait to start exercising until you hit your goal. For some of us, that can take a long time and there's no reason to wait- my days are just way more enjoyable after I've gotten some endorphins pumping.

3648	1,0,0,3,3	9	[URL]    Two blasts shook the northeastern Chinese city of Tianjin late on Wednesday. Some 700 people have been injured, 71 critically, and 50 are dead, according to the latest report by Xinhua news agency.  A total of 12 firefighters have been confirmed dead, according to Chinese state television. Authorities have lost contact with 36 other firefighters, Xinhua reported.  The National Earthquake Bureau said there were two large explosions before midnight, the first equivalent to 3 tons of TNT, and **the second equivalent to 21 tons.**  Some people are saying this could be the work of a nuke.

7528	1,3,3,3	13	*Using a throwaway just in case he frequents reddit.*    Apologies for the mistakes I (may) make in this post as English is my 2nd language.     As stated in the title, I am a 21yo female who is currently working. I met him in the same company when I was an intern last year. (Both of us are no longer working there.) We actually lost touch with each other until this year. I am mainly to be blamed since I was undergoing a bad period of depressed emotions during the time(s) he tried to chat with me over the entire last year & I was being pretty distant towards everyone in general.     Some background about his/my personality (mindsets etc): Him: He is usually likable by everyone, has a vastly huge social circle (including loads of female/male close friends), is really optimistic, sensitive and caring towards people in general and he has a really good temper.      Me: Mainly easygoing yet likes to spend alone time, has a close-to-none social circle (Only a few friends as of now) due to a huge fallout last year, tend to overthink stuff a little too much due to my sensitive emotional nature and tend to keep things to myself until I end up "exploding".      We actually met quite frequently ever since the start of this year (usually once a week on weekends) and we are getting pretty close with each other. (There are actually mutual feelings on both sides) I am worried that since I am not as mature as him (be it in terms of goals/thoughts etc), it will end up dragging him down in the long run. Just to clarify that he has never been in a relationship, I used to have numerous relationships. Both of us are actually looking to settle down and we do have quite a lot of common interests. I believe we are currently at the "friends" stage at the moment. For some reason I actually felt slightly insecure whenever he is chatting with a few of his female friends, even though he is really open with his phone & actually asked a few times if I want to hang out with him and his friends. (I never revealed this to him since I don't wish to scare him off.)         Will age difference usually be a problem in relationships? And any advice/tips? How "fast" is too "fast" to be exclusive with each other? How do I get over its weird "insecurity" of mine since it will be a double standard as most of my friends are guys?      We are actually planning to spend Valentine's day together so do you think if a movie followed by a walk along the beach/park is a feasible idea? Both of us wish to take things slow since we are still virgins, and this is the first time I feel strangely comfortable and happy with someone whenever I see them (it makes me feel really shy for some reason whenever I see him).      Any advice/insight will be greatly appreciated!         **tl;dr**: Mutual feelings on both sides, worried about the age difference and also insecurity on my own side. Hung out pretty often once per week, planning to spend Valentines' together this month as well so any advice will be great to hear.  ||||| I personally feel age is just a number and believe it shouldn't matter, the only time I don't agree with how I feel about it is when its 50 year old males and 18 year old girls. I think 10-15 years should be the max for age difference.  I agree with your plans on Valentine's day, and with how fast you should take it? Just go as fast as you both are comfortable with, that's really it. By the way, maturity doesn't always go with age, its just how much stuff you he witnessed and have learnt upon. Age does define it normally though yes, just not always.  P.s. Your English was just fine, I read it all clearly no reason to worry. ||||| So as someone who is more of your age and has dated people significantly older than me in the past, I have a bit of a different opinion than the other people here (though everyone is entitled to their opinion).  I disagree with the notion that age is just a number. Age matters a lot. When you have relationships with people who are of significantly different ages it creates a power imbalance. I think it's important to know yourself and your partner in relationships like this. I feel like a lot of relationships with large age gaps last because even though those age gaps exist, the people are on similar paths in life. But you also have to remember that an 8 year age gap when you are 30 is a lot different from an 8 year age gap when you're 21. A 21 year old could still be in undergrad while a 28 year old could be comfortably married and have a house. I just think it's important to be sure you expect the same things out of the relationship (like make sure he doesn't expect to settle down and get married when you are still trying to experience life). Age gaps can work, but they shouldn't always work. ||||| I am 37, and my wife is 28.  Been together for 7 years, and married for 3.  We worked together, and became a couple.  She has brothers that are the same age as me.  Her parents just had her unexpectedly several years after her brothers.  She trully is an older soul than her age would suggest.  She is extremely intelligent, and she is my best friend.  She is trully my equal despite the age difference.  Age doesnt determine whether a relationship is prudent. As others have said,  large age gaps can make it more difficult to relate to each other, but not always.  If it works, it works!
3500	1,3,3,3	9	American express seems to handle Authorized users differently than Chase and Citi.  I've added my wife as an authorized user on Chase and Citi cards.  Her card had the exact same numbers as mine, and her spending showed up when I logged into my account.  This spending also counted toward minimum spend for bonuses.  However, when I added her as an AU on my SPG Amex, she got a card with a different number.  Her spending does not appear when I log in to my account.  The only thing that shows is a reduction to the total available credit.  Does her spending count toward the $5,000 minimum spend for the bonus?    **TL;DR - Does AU spending count toward minimum spend for Amex bonuses, despite different card numbers?** ||||| Yes it does. ||||| Yes Amex handles AUs differently and it actually works to your advantage. The spend does count for min. spend reqs so you're not losing anything, BUT on the up side you can make a separate online account for the AU to see spending. Also because it's a different card and different account number you can sign up for Amex Offers with the AU card, and you can also sign up for the Small Business Saturday with the AU cards thus potentially doubling some of the benefits you get from your Amex account :) ||||| When you view the monthly spending online, you should as the primary user have the ability to filter by your spending, her spending, or both.  She can only see what she buys from her login.

2378	1,3,3,3,3	19	My father relapsed a few months ago. He was an alcoholic for many years until about six years ago. Six years ago he physically fought with my mother while he was drunk. From what I hear, this physical abuse was not an isolated incident. However, I was too young to remember other violent events.   From what I remember when he was drinking when I was young, he was never mean to me or my sister. Although my memories tied to his alcoholism bring back feelings of a lot of fear. He is a wonderful father when he is sober, although careless with his money and very stubborn.  He started drinking again recently. My mother moved out recently as well. I am away at college and so am unable to physically confront him. My sister lives with him now. He's running out of money, coming home drunk, and making my sister clean up his mess. I'm worried for my sister. She should not have to take care of her father. She is not his wife. She is not his mother. She has enough to deal with. Unfortunately she does not make enough money to move out at this point. She has graduated however she is having trouble finding a steady job.   I just don't know what to do. My sister confronted him once about his drinking and he said he would stop a month ago. It has only gotten worse since then. I was thinking of confronting him, however, I want to say what I had to say clearly and well-thought out. However, I don't want to hurt him. He's business is going very badly and my mom left him. We are the only ones left for him. He has no other family. I don't want to estrange him. I love him dearly and owe him so much. But something needs to be done.  What do you recommend, reddit? I'd appreciate any advice.  ||||| Children of alcoholics, especially ones that have spent a whole life growing up with it, usually have poor insight into these situations. Things are far too mixed up for you. Your caretaker urge ("we're all he has left"), for example, or your compulsion to make excuses for him ("he's a great dad when he's not drinking").  Get clear and work on getting your own head straight. This will take working some kind of recovery *for you*, like Al-anon or some kind of similar outfit. You can only do harm unless you fix your own brain damage first. ||||| Working the 12 steps outlined in the Al-Anon program may benefit you (and consequentially your father) quite a lot. The chapter "To Wives" in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous (linked in the sidebar) also has helpful suggestions for the non-alcoholic dealing with an alcoholic close to them. Good luck. ||||| I agree with the other comments... Al-Anon. The issue isn't about HIM.....it's about YOU. ||||| Perhaps you will find [my experience with Al-Anon]([URL] helpful.

The only difference between the two is hyperthreading, and games currently do not take advantage of that technology.  * You can't overclock with that motherboard, so save some money and ditch the cooler.  * 16GB RAM is overkill for a gaming PC. Stick with 8GB 1600 RAM.  * Your PSU is far over what you need. A single GTX 770 system will do fine on 550W. A GTX 780/Ti or R9 290/X will do with 750W.   If you take my advice, you should have enough money left to upgrade to an R9 290 or thereabouts. That will give you a significant performance boost. Also, look into getting an SSD.  ||||| Odd build.

Another weakness of current iterations murloc shaman is the lack of card draw as you can be top decking by turn 6 if your draws aren't there, depending on how you play the board. It's an odd balance of risking to over extend your board to push the aggression or play it slower by weaving in shaman's hero power after turn 3. There were a few games where I was 1 turn away from pulling off Everyfin only to get demolished by a timely AOE, and me essentially top decking a Murloc that lacks any board synergy to stick.  Oddly, a few games I won by holding back from playing anything except removal for like the first 4 or 5 turns (which may be too slow or incorrect if you guess wrong on the deck your opponent is playing) just so I could combo Everyfin the same turn. ||||| This is why you run pyromancer, silly ||||| It's you not killing murlocs... ||||| If all you played on turn 4 was an untaunted wyrmrest agent then I wouldn't say you had a "good" start.  ||||| equality consecrate should clean that right up

The depth will come as you actually start to control it and can breathe well.  ||||| Are you going for a bass line or a snare type sound? Based off the sounds im hearing it sounds more like a snare, if youre going for a prolonged dubstep bass sound I can help you with that, not super sure what you're going for. ||||| Are you aiming for a Napom/Ballzee style? A smooth, but really low bass is caused by moving your jaw over slightly more to the side that you're holding tight; so that you can open the gap a little more to really pull the air in.  A trick to finding a good spot, is to hit your lip roll (with air/using lungs) and try to open the gap while you're doing the sound, until you can find a good vibration that feels right for you! Good luck, if you need any more help feel free to ask! Also, here is a useful video, the fourth technique is the style you're looking for I think! Good luck! [URL]

1419	1,3	4	I'm in the process of redoing floors in a new-to-me home.    Throughout the kitchen, foyer and entry ways are existing hardwood floors (light olive wood, 2" planks) that need refinishing.  The great room, which butts up against the foyer and kitchen are currently carpeted, but will be replaced with hardwood.  I was thinking about staining the existing floors a bit darker - maybe down to a wegne wood shade, and going with dark wood on the new floors - but was concerned about not having the new floors match.  I always say it's better to be off by a mile, then off by an inch, so I was thinking about going with a much wider plank and laying them perpendicular to the existing wood.   Anyone ever do anything similar or see something similar?  Thoughts? ||||| You might search a site like [houzz]([URL] for examples of mixing hardwood floors... There are a lot of ways you can go...
110	1,3	5	I just commented this on a post, but I decided to make my own post.  Alright, what do you guys think of this.   **Add a delay so that ejected mass cannot be eaten straight away.**   So you eject some mass, and it cannot be consumed by another player until say, 5 seconds later. This delay would not apply to shooting viruses. This would add more risk to plumping up your friend, as they would have to sit around the mass for a few seconds, drawing in competition.  **Also, you could add a ~10 second delay between eating a player, and ejecting mass.**   So say I just ate some of my team-mate after he's done a massive split attack on the whole server, I have to wait 10 seconds before I can eject mass and plump my team-mate back up for another split attack. This would leave my team-mate small for a while, making him vulnerable.  Overall, these ideas would not completely kill teamers, but it would make teaming more challenging and give solo players more opportunity to take out one or more members of a team.  **TL;DR**, add delays associated with ejected mass (key component of teaming). ||||| They are aware that teams break the balance of FFA and such. The developers don't seem to mind and apparently actually intend for it to be so broken. There are a lot of ways they could lessen the overpowered team play, but they're clearly not interested in making that happen.   Your best bet is using external means to avoid teams rather than asking for the game to be improved. I usually just refresh repeatedly until I find a map that isn't already owned by any obvious teams. If that doesn't work and they're all already getting dominated, I get on one of the less-populated third party servers through agariomods. Not many people bother dominating those maps with unfair teaming up.

788	1,3	4	I happen to found a Leica M1; mint condition or at list near mint, at a flea market in my country for around $666 (the number of the beast). I'm aware for the lack of features makes it less usable and enjoyable. But isn't this Leica, or at some point become, a collectible. ||||| Leica cameras tend to lower in value over time, their lenses tend to raise. Also, the M1 is one of the least remembered/popular Leica cameras, in fact some call it "the forgotten Leica", the M3/M4 are the cameras that I think would be more likely to become investments if you found one in good working condition but not assuredly so.  To put it shortly: no.

1968	1,3,3,3	4	Basically a work contract keeps trying to pay me via paypal and wire transfer. I keep getting sent 'receipts' but then the payments never actually happen.  I've just been sent a paypal receipt I think is fake. Can anyone here help me (via PM) in working out whether it is legit or not.  ||||| Well if it's not going to your official paypal account then it's fake.  Are you doing work for someone off CL? ||||| Whenever a transaction occurs, PayPal automatically sends a receipt to the email address associated to your account. If you are a new and unverified user, it is entirely possible that PayPal sends you receipts but holds the actual funds for a short period of time. Have you tried contacting them directly?  Could you post or PM a screenshot of the receipts? ||||| Check on your actual paypal account.  If it's not also there, your receipt is probably fake and possibly related to a phishing scheme.  Don't log into any accounts at the prompt of an email or other message, only do so on what you know is the proper URL.  For example, I trade (relatively, nothing over $100)high-value items in TF2, and sometimes someone will send me a weird-looking link that looks like steamcommunity.com, but misspelled(like stearncarmunity.com) because they want me to click on the link and type in my account info so they can steal it, the items I have on it, and about $1000 worth of software licenses(plus maybe my credit card info).
9098	1,3,3	13	[deleted] ||||| I'm currently using an early 1960s Sherwood integrated amplifier that's been restored to power modern speakers.  It is definitely **not silly** to consider vintage tubes as a centerpiece for a music system.  You'd have to pry this golden age equipment from my cold dead hands.  However, you do need to do your homework on this stuff.  First, you need to have fairly efficient speakers--at least 90 dB/1 watt/1m.  It's also best to avoid speakers with wild impedance curves.  Not sure what his speakers are like, but you should probably check it out.  As far as the amp itself goes, I wouldn't pay $500 for one if the unit hasn't had any of the following work done:    * All electrolytic capacitors replaced   * All coupling caps replaced * Line to ground/chassis isolation caps replaced with new safety capacitors * Any selenium rectifiers replaced with silicon diodes and any necessary dropping resistors * Tubes tested, bias adjustment performed  That is the absolute minimum.  Any less than this, you need to start asking for the work to be done or for the price to come down.  Preferably, 10 ohm cathode-to-ground resistors, bias adjustment pots and bias test points have been added, too.   Anyway, let us know brand, model, and any restoration details as soon as you can. ||||| Interesting...the tuner is solid state with a FET front end. That was some wickedly high tech stuff in 1962. That will need new electrolytic caps and possibly an alignment to sound its best (and in the case of caps, it will need those for reliability as well)  The 299 is a very good amp. I have a 299C, which uses 7591 tubes. (more power, more expensive to retube...take the good with the bad.)

8397	1,3,2,3,3,2,3,3	14	I am the saddest kitten right now.    Every time I think my faith in humanity has reached an all time low, it finds a new bottom floor.    Water is out, at present, for a sizable trailer park somewhere in fly-over country.  Some people handle this with good grace and calm consideration, working first from the assumption that I am a fellow human being who wishes them all the best and would never intentionally shut off their water.    Some people handle this like a bunch of ravening, rabid apes on an amphetamine and LSD bender, convinced they should rape my ear-holes to get service.   I've had a few panicked old women who think water being off for three hours is going to lead to the deaths of everyone they know and love.  I'm good with that.    It's an expected part of the job, dealing with 'ancient and stupid'.    Ancient and smart doesn't call us demanding to know when the water will be back on five minutes after their last call.    Then, I had this guy.   He sounded about seventy five and was breathing through a tube of some sort that made him sound like an especially irritable Darth Vader.  You'd think that being in poor health might mellow a gentlemen somewhat.    *You'd be wrong.*    Me: Good evening, this is Blankety-Blank answering service.  Chessiecat speaking. Can I help you?  Dickwad McDickerson: Water's out.  Again.  This is twice in three hours.  What is going on over there?!  Me:At present, we have a team working on the water issue.  It should be back on by seven AM.    Dickwad:My toilet is full of shit here!  What is the deal?    Me:Apparently a second pipe burst after they fixed the first one.  As I said-  Dickward:No, fuck that.  When's the fucking water coming back on?  My bathroom smells like shit and piss!    Me:Seven AM.  (I said this pretty curtly.  I was already tired of talking to this asthmatic waste of skin.)   Dickwad: Bullshit.  You give me your name and your manager's name!  Me:I'm not authorized to do that, I'm afraid.    Dickward: You lying to me now?!  The damn water's off!  What're you going to do about it, fucko?!  By this point, I'm a touch stunned and by all rights, I could have hung up on him.  Our company policy is that if someone cusses at you, you can ditch on the call.    This has the unintended consequence that some of the operators develop a strong sense of Schadenfreude where our customers are concerned.  I, personally, will keep a real dickhead on the line just to see how *bad* he'll act.  Having worked here for many years, I know just precisely how valuable I am, since I'm the only nightshift operator.  Getting fired is unlikely, so long as I'm not nasty.  Me:Well, sir, I'm simply telling you what they've told us.  Water service will return soon.    Dickwad: You think I'm fucking around?  My lawyer will be hearing about this crap!  What's your fucking name?!  It'll be on the lawsuit!  A lawsuit.  Really?  Is...that supposed to make me scared, somehow?  Not only that, but he wants me to give him my *name* so he can sue me?  Sure.     Me:Sir, I think you might have mistaken us with the local water company.  We answer for the Blankety-Blank.  The water company are the ones who are having the technical issue.    Dickwad: The fuck they are!  I don't give a damn!  Let me talk to your supervisor or I swear, my lawyer will fuckstart your face!  I kind of wanted to correct him here, but saying 'fuck' to a customer is a nono.  The line I think he was quoting is 'fuckstart your head'.    Me:I'm afraid your water will be off until seven.  I can't help you further, sir.    Dickwad:  Yeeeah, what the fuck ever.  Look for a subpoena on your door, asshole!    Me:Then I'll be sure to have a lovely record of this call just for the judge and your landlord to listen to.  Dead...sweet...beautiful...silence.    Most people, sadly, do not have any real knowledge of HIPPA laws, but this guy knew he'd fucked up by treating me like this.  We do keep records of our calls, but only for the customers.  We could have, in theory, shared it with the landlord, but I doubt the judge could have heard it without a warrant or proof of criminal activity.   Me:Are you still there?  Dickwad:...fuck...  Me:Have a nice night, sir.    *click*   ||||| >You'd think that being in poor health might mellow a gentlemen somewhat.  As an angry cripple, no. ||||| I'm curious how HIPAA would apply here?

7081	1,3,3,3	6	Sorry about the amateur question. ||||| Model release. [This is the one I use]([URL] it is accepted by Getty and iStockphoto. ||||| So yes, you need a model release for this, but I wouldn't use something like the standard Getty release.  Releases of that ilk grant you the right to do basically *anything* with the the photo(s), which a client will likely balk at if they're commissioning you for photos.  If you're only looking to use the photos for promotional purposes then that's all you really need to be asking for.  I use a "promo only" release that I based on a template from the ASMP.   Here's the text, which was reviewed by my lawyer:  >For valuable consideration received, I grant to trouser_trout ("the Photographer") and his legal representatives and assigns, the irrevocable right to use and publish photographs of me, or in which I may be included, for the restricted purposes of self-promotion, including advertising the Photographer's business, in any manner and medium; and to alter and composite the same without restriction and without my inspection or approval.  I hereby release the Photographer and his legal representatives and assigns from all claims and liability relating to the use of said photographs for said purposes.    Below that is space for model and witness names and signatures.  Now, you could argue that you should try to get as many rights as you can so you have more flexibility later on, but if a client is paying me for a job all I expect is promo use.  And obviously if you're doing boudoir or similarly risque shots you shouldn't even expect that.    ||||| Legally speaking, (IANAL) it depends on jurisdiction.  That said, a release is a good bit of protection against a client who may get weird on you.

6698	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	22	With the immesion level of the Rift dev kit, the promise of full-body motion tracking sensors, and eventual release of multiplayer virtual reality games, it's easy to see how someone could get lost in the virtual world. With there being more and more horror cases of gaming addicts neglecting their health,  and their kids' due to hours of nonstop gaming, do you think the media will make this a problem for Oculus VR when the consumer version is released?  ||||| [deleted] ||||| It's already happened with MMOs.  A couple neglected their children so bad they had to be hospitalized while the parents were playing DDO Online.    Heck, it happens with everything.    You're right, though.  It WILL happen and the media will blame VR.   ||||| I'm 100% for personal responsibility. That being said, if an individual has issues with not unplugging in a timely fashion or under certain circumstances, I'm sure it would be trivial (and is likely inevitable) that people will develop software to address this type of concern. Things like an app that warns you after playing for a certain amount of time and then ultimately shuts it off on you, or being able to route the audio from your baby monitor into your headset, etc. It will still be up to people to opt in of course, but that's where being a responsible human being comes in, regardless of the activity. ||||| There will always be mainstream complaints and issues.  We really just need to keep fighting the fact that we are all truly responsible for ourselves and parents should be responsible for their children.  We need to stop making all these rules to pamper everyone and instead start being more responsible individually. ||||| I think the main problem people have with excessive gaming is the lack of exercise. Hopefully products like the omni will solve this problem. ||||| I fully intend to quit my job, move back in with my parents, sit in a corner... and play my little pony VR online 24/7. My cutie mark is bankruptcy!  ||||| There will definitely be several people that will develop a problem with rifting. Although it may at the same time help solve the problem of neglect  of kids due to video games depending on how long the majority of people are able to play the consumer version of the rift before taking a break. I am one of the people who does not have a problem with motion sickness at all, the first day I got my rift I tried every demo and game I had got my hands on and played a total of 2-2.5 hours. While I did not feel sick from the experience after 40 minutes to an hour of play I'm ready to quit. I do personally like this about the dev kit although it's hard to tell if it will be similar in the final release.  In the end this is a personal responsibility problem. There are several issues that Oculus VR will have to deal with this shouldn't be one of them. Although since it seems that personal responsibility seems to be dead in America I do expect there to be attacks on the company for every tiny issue.

1812	1,3,3,3,2,3,3	17	Hi all, I posted this in NoSleep when I was new to reddit, and realized from some helpful redditors it was better suited here. If anyone has had anything similar happen, I'd love to hear about it.   This experience is what got me so interested in the paranormal world and I just have to share it with everyone, hopefully someone has had something similar happen so we can compare.  When I was 16, I went to my friends house during the summer. It was great because his parents were both at work and we had the whole house to ourselves to do whatever we wanted. So we call my other friend over and she comes with a Ouija board. (I now know I should have never played around with it. THEY ARE NOT A TOY.) Myself being a skeptic with the whole ouija concept at the time, decided hey, let's mess around with it. So the three of us headed down to the basement and began asking it questions. I wanted to be a turd and scare them so I started moving the pointer around saying "yes" and "no" and what not, until my friend caught on and they said "Let's all just hover our fingers over the pointer!" I agreed, and thought nothing would happen and this was a waste of time.  When the pointer started moving again, I thought something was fishy still. My one friend asked all the questions. "What's your name?" "Baba Yaga" it spelled out, which to me meant gibberish. "Can you give us a sign?" "Yes" "Now?" "Yes" So we sat there in silence and nothing happened. Not even a flicker of a light or anything. We were all disappointed so we pushed the board aside started talking about how this was all a hunk of crap.  My one friend decides to go upstairs and grab us some ice cream bars from the freezer. The two of us just chilling in the basement where startled when the friend BOLTED back down the stairs, tears streaming down her face.  "The kitchen.." she whispered as she huddled behind me. I felt my knees tremble, because I had never seen her scared before, and I know something must have happened. So slowly the three of us hiked up the stairs and I peered around the corner into the kitchen. Every single cupboard in the entire kitchen (there was a lot of cupboards) was wide open and EVERYTHING that was in the cupboards was piled into a pyramid type shape in the centre of the room. I felt sick because I couldn't explain how it happened.  I knew neither of my friends had done it because you go through the kitchen to get to the basement and everything was normal beforehand, and when my friend went up to grab the ice cream bars she was literally gone for seconds.  Being scared and worried, I told my friend to leave his home and to come hangout at my house until we figured out what to do next. That night, his parents called mine to say we couldn't hang out anymore, and for him to come home not only because the kitchen was a mess, but ALL THE wallpaper in the ENTIRE house had been ripped down and thrown in the centre of his parents bed. All three of us stopped being friends after that. I hadn't heard from either of them until my one friend called after seeing a scene in the second paranormal activity where the cupboards explode open I guess. She wanted to confirm that what happened with us was real. And I told her it had indeed happened. It also took a few years for find out that Baba Yaga is known as a trickster witch in russian folklore. To this day I still don't understand what else could have caused this all besides spirits of some sort. And because of this experience and MANY more after that occurrence, I've really dipped into the Spiritualist way.  Also I want to note that I've had paranormal events/experiences my whole life, I learned the tarot when I was 10 and still do it now, but it's as if since this experience, it's amplified, in good ways and bad. ||||| I have an old teacher who at one time worked at a very haunted 3 story bar in Massachusetts.

XD  The capable people are fighting a war in an uncharted geographical setting that is pretty far from Konoha. He's a little kid and is most likely sheltered with the other everyday civilians in the village.  That defeat was a lucky one. He would barely last a couple minutes against Madara and Co.

6711	1,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,3,0	39	I've updated my player to include Vive/SteamVR support. Valve kindly sent me a Vive to develop my player on and I've now added support for it through the SteamVR plugin. This can be downloaded through my website. Go here [URL] to read my blogpost and learn about other updates I've made.  As I have the Vive now I can confirm compatibility with the Vive, Oculus and standard monitor.

4550	1,3,3,3,2	7	Good afternoon guys and girls!  I'm looking to put together a small team of players for a new project of mine. I plan on starting a server with its own modpack. The modpack would be fantasy based ideally with no tech but i'm open to suggestions.  I would like to give the server an "RPG" style feel including quests, special weapons, ect. just to give people a bit of progression past the origonal mods.   Just to give you guys a little info on me. I'm a 22 year old freelance web dev. I've been playing Minecraft since alpha and ran a very successful Bukkit server a few years ago. I shut the server down to focus on my business but i'm now in a place that I have some time to work on a server again. I've been playing with mods on private servers with a small group of friends recently and love the whole feel. Mods really open up a new game for me and i'd love to bring that experience to more players.  What I need  Server Admin -  I'll be dealing with all of the modpack setup and config but I would ideally like a server admin to help me keep things up to date and bounce ideas off.  Lore/Quest Writers  Builders  Beta Testers/Friendly Faces  And just about anyone else who feels they can bring something to the pack/server  If you are interested in helping please post down below and let me know. There's no age requirement, just be willing to use Skype. ||||| hey ill be willing to help you out with your project and i do have a skype so we can talk  ||||| Im open to beta testing and maybe building. Im not amazing at building but I do okay.  I'd write lore but... I started like 5 stories i've never finished so. q-q ||||| I've would be willing to be the Server Admin. I have about a year of modded server moderation experience back in the 1.2.5 days. I'll also be willing to help with the lore/writing portion as well. I'm a decent builder, but quite slow because I try everything out. I'm overall just looking to be involved in something I think will be big from the getgo. My skype is cloudsofsteel ||||| Hi, sounds like a really interesting project, I would love to help build. I have literally no time atm, but that will all change in a couple of months, what do you think the state of play will be by then?
3676	1,3,2,3,3,3	7	Okay, so this year I'm going to do Minecraft cosplay, and was wondering if you guys had any tips for mounting a sword in your back in a way that is visible, but that you don't have to carry it the whole time, and can draw it when needed (specifically the foam minecraft sword) Thanks in advance!  P.S- Sorry if this isn't the right place. It seemed like the best option. ||||| Maybe use some cover tech clips? It's they used in the sw movies to keep their lightsabers on their belts ||||| do you want it to just sit there on your back like Cloud? or in a sheath?

9361	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	13	Hello guys,   Ret pally here.  1-2 weeks ago I managed to do 18-19 k dps, today with 641 ilvl I'm doing 15 k on average which seems kinda low ( Tectus ), on butcher I go to 16-16,5 or so. As far as icy-veins and my experience in WoW or any other games in general goes my rotation is flawless, I use pots, miss enchants tho.   Talent choices - I know that Divine Purpose is not recommended but it actually gives me 0,5-1k dps more over Sanctified Wrath o.0  here's my profile [URL]   If any1 could help I'd really appreciate it.    ||||| It could simply come down to mechanics. As melee, if you have to switch from one mob to another, particular if the mob you are switching to requires running and pausing dps, it's going to bring that down some.  DPS fluctuates from week to week with each fight purely depending on if you happen to need to move from bad or have to swap to bosses.  Edit: Looking at your gear, get some gems and enchants as well. You shouldn't be raiding without. ||||| Forewarning: I dont play ret.  1. Make sure you're timing your cooldowns alongside raid cooldowns, specifically bloodlust. All your big cooldowns give better marginal returns when you're bloodlusted.  2. Gear. I dont have the ret pally priority in front of me, but you seem to be spreading over haste, multi, crit, mastery, and versatility. This seems like a lot of spread to me. Double check your stat priorities and make sure you're not wearing super redundant gear (for example the 655 ring youve got on is definitely under the Tank Spec loot tables, it might be good for ret too, but it's worth a look!)  3. Enchantments. I dont know if the armory shows them, but it looks like you dont have any. Get them, they're great.   4. Food/Flasks. Bring them if you arent already. Also make sure you pick up strength potions. If your tanks arent already, have them do pull timers, use a strength potion before the tank pulls, then you'll have it active for the initial burst, and be able to use one later on in the fight.  5. Talents: Drop selfless healer for sacred shield IMO. The absorption is quite strong, and you shouldnt need to be stopping to heal other people during the fight. I really would suggest changing back to sanctified Wrath, or even Holy avenger. Holy avenger + Avenging wrath + bloodlust = Hilarious dps for those burst needed moments (tectus anyone?) Sanctified is just guaranteed bonus damage, and simplifies your rotation because you dont have to hunt for procs.  6. Glyphs. Consider swapping in the exorcism one. Yeah it drops range to melee, but it turns it into a cleave damage. Which works really well on any boss that has multiple targets stacked ontop of each other. (Stands in kargath, basically 80% of tectus. 100% of twin ogron. 70% of brackenspore. Butcher it's kind of worthless on. Good for the add phases in Koragh and margok.) You should be in melee range for most of the fight anyway.  ||||| I suggest you read sols thread on mmo-champion  [URL]  It is by far the best resource for ret theorycrafting out there.   You say you are not making mistakes but the fact of the matter is that if your dps is low, you are messing something up and I would be very surprised if it was not something to do with your end ||||| Never assume your rotation is fine. Go to Warcraftlogs, record yourself, ask someone to look them over. ||||| You're missing gems and enchants. For butcher go either empds or Sera + SW. ||||| Your rotation is not fine. If your rotation was fine, you would be pulling 20k single target on Kargath and Butcher at 635 ilvl with a 630 weapon. All the enchants and stat optimisation in the world won't account for such a huge disparity.  Source: Recently was 635 ilvl on my second paladin.

2382	1,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	18	I've been spamming the 12 min roach max build a lot, and by now I can meet all the supply benchmarks near-perfectly. However, I'm still having a lot of trouble with immortal/sentry, probably because immortals rape roaches and ffs dont help. By the 10 minute mark, when most gold-league immortal/sentry all-ins hit, I don't have enough lings/roaches to deal with it.  So, should I switch to a different build? Or try and modify my army comp to include hydras/more lings? Or should I cut drones earlier and just focus on making an army without my third saturated?   How do *you* deal with immortal/sentry as far as macro builds go? I know you're supposed to try and get the toss player to waste ffs and not fight in a choke and all that, but before the actual engagement, how do you prepare? ||||| Yes if you have sufficient macro and get good flanks and engagements you should be able to win. This is how I win against immo-sentry pushes. ||||| If you are in Gold and you do the Stephano build (thus max out at 11:30, 70+ supply at  8:00 and 44 supply at 5:50) as perfectly as you say you do, you will surely not lose a game. Open up a custom game, and play versus nothing. Then check the benchmarks I just gave you. There will be a significant leak somewhere. ||||| I haven't lost to the sentry immortal thing in weeks, I generally let myself take a pounding but I MAKE SURE that my lings flank, if you do its usually enough to clean up the fight. Just make sure enough goes wrong for your opponent that you can have a good engagement :P ||||| It would be fair to say it probably isn't the *best* way to handle it, but the general ingredients are the same you just opt for more lings than you normally would. Life also just did an interesting variation of this to hard counter PartinG with Hydras and Hydra range. That was disgusting to watch.  ||||| I've got a question that just ran in my head, if I scout immo-sentry early enough, how quick could you pump out muta's if you stick on two bases? You wouldn't need many, just enough to snipe the sentries and then attack the immo as roaches keep from getting destroyed? Worst case he scouts you going muta, stops immo production and jumps into colossus/warpgate ball with maybe some extra sentries.... Im just theorycrafting here btw, I rarely ever use mutas besides light harrass (obviously) before transitioning into corruptor/brood. ||||| You can beat it straight up w/ roach ling.  The main thing is to get your upgrades/macro hatch started on time, and not drone your 3rd very hard so you can start making more units earlier.  It's important to not let him reach your base untouched, as he will have gathered a lot of sentry energy and extra units otherwise.  [URL] and  [URL]  are good resources.   ||||| >I've been spamming the 12 min roach max build a lot, and by now I can meet all the **supply benchmarks near-perfectly**. However, I'm still having a lot of trouble with immortal/sentry, probably because immortals rape roaches and ffs dont help. By the 10 minute mark, when most **gold-league** immortal/sentry all-ins hit, I don't have enough lings/roaches to deal with it.  I'm low dia, I dont hit the supply benchmarks.. immo/sentry is one of the hardest builds to counter yes, but something doesnt add up in your statement. If you're gold and hit the supply benchs for that build, and still have trouble with immo/sentry... you're doing something else very very very wrong.

996	1,2,3,3,3	13	So, I am at break point 6. I don't see 7 in my sights. Maxing paragon points doesn't even get me close. Right now with my current gear I am doing 877k. I have heard and read different things about the DMG being irrelevant to an extent. I just don't see that being the case when people like Gaby have tons of DMG. I had a heck of a lot more DMG before I started using a hellfire ammy with steady aim and using ROG once I got a TNT. So, how important is the DMG and how important is that last 4.15 breakpoint? My ultimate goal is to get on the leaderboards. ||||| Did you really think 4.15, 1.5+ million sheet DPS (with eDPS even higher), and reaching the leaderboards was easy? Haha. I'm a 2.84bp bow DH with 1.6 mill sheet DPS... And I'm not even close to the right gear for 4.15. Good luck to us all haha.  ||||| I'm paragon 527 and my alt DH is 2% ias from 4.15. It's insanely difficult to hit that breakpoint without using ias on amulets.   Stick to 2.84 frost fire and if you get perfect Taskers and unity/SoJ with 7%ias then start thinking about 4.15.  ||||| Not sure where you read that dmg was negotiable - it is the means of getting on the leaderboards. At high levels you will fail even a well-rolled rift if you don't kill fast enough.   And it should be noted that Frostfire @ 2.84 can still pull it off. ||||| Not a pro yet. But im on BP 7 trying to hit 4.15 bp too; only 20 ias away. Imo 4.15 bp is all about how fast sentry cast your skills. so higher the bp the more frequent it attack from what I read. 
3887	1,3,3	4	Yeah I know there are many people worse off than I am financially and health-wise. But emotionally and socially, I'm in a worse spot than most people.   So here's my situation: I'm a 31 year old male. I have no real friends, I have a few acquaintances that I still chat with from time to time, and I hang out with one of my cousins sometimes. Obviously I'm pretty terrible at socializing and making friends so I'm very lonely. Never been in a relationship and never had sex.  I hate my job which is doing IT Support and I'm not very good at it either. I have  a four year degree from a decent school that I haven't done shit with. Pretty much all my co-workers dislike me and talk about me behind my back.   I have no real hobbies except running and hiking on some occasions. I've been slowly letting my body go for the past year so I've gotten chubby. And I don't know what I want to do with my life or how I can change things.  Because of the co-worker situation and the fact that my commute is too long and somewhat dangerous in the winter, I'm looking for a new job closer to home. But since I've gotten fired a couple times and have basically been doing only desktop support, my options are a little limited than I'd like them to be. A big part of me feels like I need to make a new start somewhere else. I'd like to find someplace that isn't too far from some family so I have some support if I need it.   Yeah I know that changing my location isn't going to fix my problems but maybe it'll give me some motivation to solve them. Any advice from someone who's gone through something like this or who could help me would be really great. ||||| We are both in almost the exactly same situation, I guess (apart from the age and the job). I also think that I have a relatively stable and comfortable life, yet I feel completely miserable. Perhaps we both have to find what bothers us about our lives and work on changing that? ||||| Well, I can count on one hand how many friends in my whole life, and even then only few years at most each. Currently there's just 1 person online I chat from time to time (I'm in my 20s by the way), never been even an inch closer to something like a relationship, and the only prolonged contact with a female I had was with an online friend that I got really well and even met a few times, but needless to say, I was "friendzoned". So as you can see my social life is probably even worse than yours. However, I love myself and life, and all that because I have passions. You might don't have any current passions, but passions don't just show out of blue, you search for them, you search for whatever you might love SO yeah, the probably best cure is to find something to fill your life with. Did you try getting a pet for example?

Many other had feathers, or a combination of feathers and scales. ||||| Depends on the dinosaur. The ones with feathers (probably most therapods) would have been not much different from modern birds. Ones with scales (the rest, based on skin imprints from a few different groups) would have been a bit tougher. Ones with armor (the ankylosaurs) may very well have been bulletproof, but at that point we're not really talking about skin anymore. But this all assumes they didn't have unusual properties that didn't fossilize. ||||| We don't actually know what the skin of dinosaurs looked like or was made of. Because skin is an organic material it decomposes away, so humans have never seen dinosaur skin.  We can guestimate the properties of the skin based on environment, but the color of a dinosaurs skin is really up to the designer of the image. In fact, google image search the name of any dinosaur, and you will see a range of varying colors of skins.
8418	1,3,3,3	5	I want your opinion on something. Do you guys think I  should spend my eggs crafting Spooky walls (that will give me 0.05% bonus) or on Golden bags (hoping to get some donuts)? Anyone knows the odds on getting donuts from Golden bags? Thanks :) |||||  Freemium player only here. Have not got any doughnuts thru gold bags unfortunately. Went with the spooky walls myself. The .05% is nothing but added up times every 5 is a quarter basis point to every cent earned. In my simple opinion ( or two Pecos) the wall adds up daily to be far more money earned over time than any other prize. Not sure of the odds. I usually get at least a doughnut thru friends tapping every other day. Happy tapping! ||||| I don't know the odds but from my experience it's very rare to find a donut in a treat bag. I've been playing for about a month and so far I've found one donut while clearing litter, maybe one from tapping aliens and a couple from UFOs. I definitely haven't seen more than one or two from (gold) treat bags.  Personally I was kinda banking on a surprise to come along at the end of the event for us to cash in our leftover treats. However if the general consensus is that they're just going to vanish, I guess I'll just take some more Spooky Walls (already got a bunch of them -- from treat bags, I think).  ...But why is 'Trick or treating' still an activity??? ||||| Arrghh...last night with 30 min till the clock went out i was a little short and popped some doughnuts to get spooky walls so I could finish building a pyramid. And today i've more than made up for the items i was short on and got walls from a random brown bag. I would go golden bag. The odds for doughnuts are low but you might luck out and get a random craftable item anyways.

7733	1,3,2,3	11	I have an Asus router with a closed source firmware on it.  I really like the idea of having something open on it, like DD-WRT or Tomato, since the code can be vetted to make sure there are no backdoors.  But even though the code can be peer reviewed, has either of these router firmwares been security audited by anyone?  And the last question.  Even if the router OS had been fully audited an vetted, what is the chance that an exploit might exist at the hardware level? ||||| I'd definitely go with open-source firmware for a consumer level router.  I can't think of sector that has shown more wanton disregard for security than the consumer router market. Wifi routers still come with broken technology like WPS and WEP enabled by default, and worse, WPS continues to use default pins or is generates pins according to algorithms that have long been compromised.  Open source is no magic bullet for security (heartbleed persisted for years), but when the alternative is manufacturers who don't give a damn about security it's a no-brainer. Also, you can bet that DD-WRT/Tomato will continue to be actively developed well after the manufacturer has ended support for the product.       ||||| What are the answers if you ask those questions about the Asus firmware?  Saying "I don't want to use Tomato/DDWRT because it hasn't been formally audited" doesn't make sense if the other alternative hasn't been formally audited, either.   ||||| deleted

I wanted to start to learn again from the beginning with what I already know which is VB and Ubuntu Command Line.   I had already begun to read The Linux Command Line by William E. Shotts, Jr. and have been working a bit in Ubuntu and was currently watching 'Visual Basic Tutorial For Absolute Beginners' by CodeGeek on youtube when a close friend of mine and many others(co-workers) have told me to stop doing VB and start with Python and to work on Linux later on.

1733	1,3,1,1,3,3	9	I'd read the book by Allen Carr in one read that day in 2000 and never finished my last pack of cigarettes.

There is a problem using the same reasoning that he does for it. Although lots of things remain true, one crucial difference is that the urge to smoke is not natural. There is absolutely no physiological reason why anyone should want to inhale the smoke of a burning plant. Sexual urges, on the other hand, are very natural and useful. It's the pornography that is not natural and that is abusing these urges and makes us act in unhealthy way.  What remains the same between smoking and faping is the illusion of dependence. The belief that one cannot possibly make it throughout a day without the fix. In both cases we train our brain for this feeling to control us, while we should have never given up the control of our actions in the first place.  ||||| I havent smoked in a year.

932	1,3,3	7	In TNG 5x09 "A Matter of Time" a time traveling thief Berlinghoff Rasmussen attempts to steal a bunch of Star Fleet equipment but gets caught and ends up in prison.    The rules for time traveling in Star Trek are all over the place, but is there some cannon explanation as to why a person couldn't just travel a year or so ahead of time, learn if his plot was a success or not?  And whether or not to get to go ahead with the plot?  Some questions about the episode also come to mind, how did Berlinghoff know so much about the Enterprise *before* he arrived?  He knew where the Enterprise would be at a certain time to travel there and to beam over onto the bridge.  So he did do some historical research, but not enough to figure out whether or not he was caught?  So, information about where the Enterpise would've been/could've easily been available in some history books, maybe Memory Alpha, but how much would the fact of the time traveler be kept a secret?  Odo is able to get information about it when talking with Worf, but Odo's security rating is pretty high.    Also, so the time traveling pod travels back to 22nd Century New Jersey...and...just sits there?  Like in Berlinghoffs garage?  An abandoned mine shaft next to the Delorean? Maybe Section 31 has to get it and cover it up?  Is there any cannon or Betta cannon that could help explain what happens next to the ship? ||||| The ship was probably simply recovered by Temporal Agents from further in the future. If not, we can only suppose that its presence in 22nd century New Jersey was a necessary part of the timeline (I.e, it got built in the 26th century because its stranding in the 22nd century caused its own existence, etc.). ||||| > is there some cannon explanation as to why a person couldn't just travel a year or so ahead of time, learn if his plot was a success or not? And whether or not to get to go ahead with the plot?  There probably will be a rule against this behavior when time travel becomes commonplace. That hasn't happened in the eras in which Trek unfolds.  > how did Berlinghoff know so much about the Enterprise before he arrived?  It's possible that the *real* time-traveler Rasmussen stole the pod from was planning a visit to the Enterprise. The mission wasn't particularly important (as long as it was accomplished in the correct way), so the risk of temporal contamination would have been low. Or perhaps there was cloaking technology on the timepod that the historian could have used to remain unseen while he observed them. If you're wondering why the historian would choose that particular, rather mundane mission, well, perhaps he was born on that planet and wanted to see how it was saved.  It's also possible that the pod had a database of 24th-century ships, and Rasmussen pulled up the Enterprise and its crew as soon as he saw it.

5635	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	Stupid parties!  Went to a friends birthday party and while there were tons of carby foods ( chips, cupcakes, so frustrating).  But, I was pleased to see a cheese tray, a raw veggie tray and some rolled deli meats, and a nice big bowl of spinach articoke dip ( woo hoo!)  I ask the host what was in the dip... frozen spinach, frozen artichokes, parm. cheese, cream cheese, sour cream and garlic.  I think I'm in the clear and I LOAD UP and dip everything in it, even feeling it was pretty safe to get a few cherry tomatoes and cucumbers since I was low for my carb count for the day.  A while later, I'm thanking her for having low-carb options ( she knows I'm doing Keto) and she says " Oh, and I even used low fat cream cheese and sour cream for you!".  DAMNIT!!!!  I had a least 6 or 7 oz. of that dip- likely at least 20 grams of carbs just there!    Lesson learned- never trust a non-ketoer. :) ||||| oh well KCKO ||||| Points to the host for trying at least.   Most times I go to friends when food is served there are no low carb options, and when I decline the carb heavy foods, the host generally insists I try "just one" and that "just one won't hurt".   For some people, "just one" might not hurt them at all.  For me, "just one" means I go on a fast food bender and eat everything in sight, lol. ||||| FYI I made spinach artichoke dip myself with all full fat ingredients and it was still like 6 carbs per serving. And I'm pretty sure servings were about 2 oz. That kind of thing you have to be really careful with because they're all "keto friendly" foods but when you melt them all down into a delicious dip its easy to eat too much and go over carbs (and calories).   Anyway, all you can do is just keep trucking everyone makes mistakes.  ||||| There would have been a fair amount of carbs in that dip anyway. Artichokes are carby and cream cheese has carbs and garlic and sour cream.  Delicious -- and worth it to me. But carbs nonetheless. ||||| My family embraced full fat foods some time ago, thank goodness.  Friends, though, are constantly using low fat things.  Lately, the round of potlucks at work has been...difficult, to say the least (the theme was "pasta" last time).  I have to say that the guys in the group really appreciate my efforts (protein + fat always included...I think I'll do keto chile next time, regardless of theme).  Spinach dip is the bomb.  That's another one I should learn to make for potlucks...I still have scruples about bringing regular bread for it, need to learn to make crackers... ||||| i got tricked this morning too!   i take metamucil on the REG. and i was staying at my parents last night. My mom knows I take it and they all do too, so she made me my morning slurry with her brand (unflavored Rite Aid) and slugged in down only to find out she just fed me 15g of sugar!   BE WEARY OF THE FIBER SUPPLEMENTS ||||| Not the worst fuck up ever though. 20g carbs is still pretty low. Just be extra careful tomorrow. And be proud of yourself: at least you didn't have bread or cake or beer or something.

9218	1,3,3	4	Level of experience Biked as a child and teenager, haven't done much at all since I started driving at 16.  Currently 24. Price range is around ~400$.  I want to buy used. I live in the Boston metropolitan area and plan to use the bike mostly for commuting to grad school and around town. It is about 3 miles each way for my daily commute, all city riding.  Here are a few links to craigslist of some possibilities: [URL] [URL] [URL]  Also, I know very little about bike maintenance, how much time/money would a bike like these typically require to keep on the road?  Any feedback or opinions are welcome.                ||||| I really want to like the Cannondale but the price is completely out of whack. If it was in really good condition it would be worth a bit above $200. If it needs new tires or any drivetrain work that more or less leaves the frame value which is around $100. Also South Attleboro is 40 miles from center of Boston. So probably not for you. [URL]  The unidentified french bike is my next favorite on the list. Mainly based on price and looks slightly more cared for than the Royce.  The Royce Union is third, it is ok but nothing great. If the owner won't budge on the price I would consider walking away and continuing my search.  Overall better than average picks than most of the r/whichbike craigslist postings I've seen.   ||||| If you're commuting year round in Boston, you'll need to get fenders. So budget $40 for a decent set. As long as you clean your bike and do basic maintenance on it, it shouldn't cost you more than $100 a year for a tuneup and fixing the occasional flat.  There will be days (like last Thursday) where it's pretty challenging to bike on the street.  What size are you (the bikes here are a spread)? I'm selling a 54cm Cannondale with Dura-Ace; could give you a deal. PM me.

Very, VERY few courses close down for winter. Here in Michigan, I "Winter Disc" several times per month. Most locales even have winter leagues with plenty of seasoned veterans who will give tips, help you learn the game and how to throw/play/improve and myself (as well as several other locals in my area) always try to set up new players with a few free discs more suited to their play style.  ||||| FDR State Park up the Taconic Parkway, Leonard Park in Mt.

I personally would love to join a big channel like Zee News, just to get a taste of what kind of hi-jinks go on behind the scenes, that leads to the crapfest they put on Primetime every day.  I like their segments in which they try to bring social awareness, but even those are ruined by the cringy and over the top packages that are passed through the editing room, and on to national television.

3615	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	15	I'm looking for recommendations for graduate programs and laboratories that have experience with machine learning and AI, particularly related to robotics or cyber physical applications. I have a mech.eng BS, significant mechanical experience, decent EE/CS/programming experience, I've been working in robotics R&D for the past two years, and I'm interested in moving more deliberately into machine learning. I like systems/project-management -level work, which is why I've resisted hyper-specializing and haven't done a graduate degree already, but machine learning is a sufficiently complicated and specific field that you can't teach yourself on weekends (at least not well enough that someone will hire you for it), so I'm looking for a few labs to talk to. (Obviously MIT, CMU, Stanford have great programs. I'm looking for specific professors/labs.)  Recommendations? Thanks. ||||| Pieter Abeel at Berkeley has done some pretty awesome work in robotics. ||||| Several faculty at the [Autonomous Robotics Laboratory at GMU]([URL] may interest you. In particular, [Jana Kosecka]([URL] and [Sean Luke]([URL] ||||| I've done some undergraduate research at the Creative Machines Laboratory at Cornell. They have a number of interesting projects that focus on robotics, learning algorithms, and 3D printing. Professor Hod Lipson heads this lab and he is generally open to ideas for research topics; plus, there are cool robots covering all of the shelves in the lab :)   [URL]  Edit: Probably the most relevant ML project from this laboratory is the "automated scientist" program [Eureqa]([URL] It's known for having derived Newton's laws of motion by data mining physical systems, as well as achieving a description of a double pendulum's motion. Eureqa was the thesis project of PhD student Michael Schmidt, who's now graduated and working to find/implement market applications for the program.  ||||| SRI International's Vision Technologies lab. PM me and we could talk more about it. ||||| I don't recommend Stanford for ML right now. From what I understand, their department has sort of lost a bunch of key faculty in that area. People thought it would get better once Coursera started running on its own (Daphne and Andrew would return) but I know that Andrew has taken a consulting position at Baidu and a bunch of students in the lab are not super optimistic about the next couple years. ||||| Are you looking for a Master's degree? ||||| Machine learning is distinct from AI, and both are distinct from robotics, as far as I'm aware, though of course there is overlap (many consider machine learning to be a branch of AI). Not really sure whether you're asking about ML, robotics, or ML applied to robotics? ||||| > mech.eng BS, significant mechanical experience, decent EE/CS/programming experience  Not all robotics is ML based, there's lots you can do based on your experience and do some cool math/research (e.g. control systems)  > I like systems/project-management -level work  this is very far from phd level work, especially in ML, you might want to readjust what you're looking for instead of trying to follow what's "hot" or sounds cool  That being said, you need to first boil more than just ML. Do you want to work with robotics: vision, controls, path planning, sensor fusion, etc.  or do you want pure ML stuff: inference methods, optimization, clustering, etc.  A bit more information will make it a lot easier to find active research groups.
8599	1,3,3,3,3,3	7	I know it has only been a few days, but there had been stress tests every day or other day. I am perfectly fine with this, but I'm just curious as to why they have stopped for now. Hopefully they're just working on it. ||||| Valve probably collected enough data for now. They'll likely focus on fixing a few bugs/improve matchmaking in general in preparation for the next stress test. ||||| Why would they need to test it so often? I think 7 is enought to collect all data about servers ||||| I'm reasonably sure the purpose of thous tests was to make sure the games would consistently have a Begging, a middle, and an End. We've probably given them enough information to work with so they're probably dedicating some time to fixing/adjusting various things. I'm sure they will come back as soon as they feel like its ready for another round of testing. Bad news is its Valve, so there's no real way of telling how long this "fixing" period will last.  Keep in mind this is all **Speculation** so don't take my word for it. ||||| They probably stopped because they're working on it more now, the third stress test was a mess and that needs to be fixed. ||||| Too much stress

We would love feedback on how this is going so far and are tossing around tons of ideas to make it work better. With 275+ registered participants and 50+ songs submitted this week already, this project is far beyond the scope of anything we imagined only about 8 days ago when planning this all out. Since we didn't separate into genres this time around, we may not post a top 5 for this week. That's a one time thing though, I promise :3  I guess what I'm trying to say is that we need help, big time. Ideally, I'd like to bring on a few more moderators and helpers to tackle some of the work that simply takes too much time for any one or two people to do by themselves.

4692	1,3,3,3,3	9	Hi there! I just retrieved my Secret Santa giftee's information today, and when I read that he liked folk music, I was super stoked! My problem is this: he specified that he liked 60s era folk music, but I don't really want to get him an album he probably already has (like any by Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, etc.). Does anybody have any suggestions for perhaps less popular artists/albums that warrant gift-giving? Thanks! ||||| Steeleye Span produced some stuff in the 60s and they still are, actually. It's not the absolute most common of all folk, so it could be an alright guess. ||||| Neil Young-Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House 1968 It came out not to long ago and is absolutely amazing!

I 502 legalizes personal possession and consumption.  I 502 sets up a safe infrastructure for purchasing marijuana.  I 502 will raise *much needed* revenue for a state that has been forced to cut vital social services.  I 502 defines "THC concentration" as the active metabolite, and not as carboxy THC (which is the one that sits in your fat for weeks).    I have yet to hear an argument against I-502 that was not based in some incorrect assumption or plain misinformation.   ||||| I just read up on this and my opinion is that this is no good. Why are we fighting for the government to tax marijuana? We're so focused on having them 'allow' us to smoke this plant, we forgot we never needed their permission anyway.   Except, jail is bad.

960	1,1,3,3,3,0	13	hello everyone,  Ever been in a battle and find yourself running out of Heavy or Special ammo, go out of your way to put yourself in a safe place, then go clumsily into your inventory screen and get delayed because of your internet connection, come out of the screen and find yourself almost dead or dead?  Well, I have.  yes that's a run on sentence.    The wave and the dancing and the sitting and the pointing.... It's fun and all.  But it's not as fun as destroying your enemy with that fully loaded rocket launcher or machine gun.    **What button?:**  Maybe replace UP with special ammo synthesis and DOWN for Heavy.    **Time to select?:**  Push and hold Up or Down.  Maybe this should take just as long or slightly longer than a perfect internet connection and or speed button pushing sequence.    **Whats the improvement?:**  Maybe, just maybe, it will be a more consistent and better way to pop ammo synthesis?  I assume yes.   I understand that it's sort of game breaking to allways have heavy ammo available but the option is there anyways.  It just a bad process at this time and it completely fills your screen with mostly unnecessary stuff.

For example, TouchWiz is complete garabage with most of its features being huge gimmicks that are exclusively used to persuade people to buy Samsung phones. Also, specs are unnecessairly high on most Android phones, which in the end results in punishing the end user (QHD screens result in sub optimal battery life and graphics performance, or 2.4GHz SoC eating up battery life for something stupid, like loading the calendar app.   On iOS, they do more right by keeping their system clean of junk apps (stock or from the App Store), having more features that are actually useful / well implemented such as Touch ID or Apple Pay, and really genuinely trying to improve the user experience (rounded edges and increased thinness on new iPhone 6 to enhance grip, not increasing screen resolution unnecessarily, etc). And besides, I demand perfection from my mobile device, and although nobody can provide what I seek, iOS is the best I can get.  Thoughts, opinions? ||||| Personally I'm the opposite. To put it as you did:    Personally, I use Android. iOS doesn't appeal to me. I like to have complete control over the software of a phone and with android I can do pretty much whatever I want.    There is an exception though... No Samsung. Samsung is (from my experiences) pretty much how you describe android.  Another reason why I don't use iOS? I'm okay with companies that want to release a new model each year with minimal improvements and expects such an unnecessarily high price. I don't like it but they can do that if they want. But take this example... I currently use a Nexus 4. It's 2 years old. In another 2 years time I will be able to install new apps. I cannot say the same for iOS which (from having to explain to my parents) limits a lot of apps by OS version. Sometimes I can understand that... Bioshock isn't going to run on a 4 year old iPhone but sometimes it's stupid. Take an iPhone 5... I can guarantee that in another 2 years you'll find a lot of apps that make you think "Why is that only for iOS#?".    Yes there are similar problems when it comes to android but they are easily overcome without having to buy a new phone. Hell, I can even install tablet-only apps on my phone if I want to.  There are many other reasons but it can kinda be summed up in this half-joking sentence which has proven to be true a few times: "If you need help with your iPhone's new features, just ask an Android user. We've had this stuff for years."    Don't get me wrong though, I completely understand the appeal of Apple as a single platform for everything but I really don't like that.  At least Apple and Android are better than Windows phones. (Oh god please don't hurt me...)  Edit: Found the [source]([URL] for the quote I used... (Please don't hurt me even more...) ||||| Android. Because custom ROMs. ||||| If you don't jailbreak your iPhone, the OS is too restrictive in my opinion. I agree it's beautiful, clean, and simple, but once you jailbreak it you can retain those qualities while extending functionality and enabling customization capabilities as good as on Android. ||||| That's a really skewed view of Android. Not sure where the "not thought out" or "unclean" pieces came from. In some ways I think it's more well thought out than iOS, although I agree iOS' design UI is more refined and uniform.   I also agree TouchWiz like 2 years ago was pretty ugly, but it has gotten significantly better since then. And the while some features are gimmicky, a number of them are fairly nice. I don't use Samsung phones, but I have nothing against them.  Also, the 2011 Motorola Atrix (Android) had a fingerprint reader. NFC  (the technology behind Apple Pay) have been an Android feature since 2010, and the entire design of the new iPhone is pretty much the HTC One M8.   People are snobs on both sides (I admit to being a twat about Android all the time) but the double standard of iOS being soooo much better can get pretty annoying. They both have pros and cons, and while I prefer Android, I absolutely acknowledge that iOS has some amazing design and software features.  Basically don't be so closeminded about your phone.  ||||| Android because options:  LG G2 is probably the best phone ever made, you could argue me on that, but it's at least in the argument. OP talks about high resolutions being useless, or bad, but the 1080p screen on that thing PERFECT! Battery life is a couple days of use, longer if I'm not using it for much. The extra screen real-estate is REALLY useful and actually allows you to be productive on it.  Now, the LG G3 ruined it, they were all worried about the spec sheet (they being the fucking marketing people, honestly, marketing and HR are the two dumbest fucking departments) and made the screen 4K HD. So it gets shit battery life, gets hot, runs certain apps slowly and has display issues with others.  options:  Now you know the great thing? I just won't buy that phone, the LG G2 will last me at least another year, if not 2-4 more years. So we'll just not buy the G3 and LG will go "oh, people actually don't want that crap" then they won't do it again.   Options:  In the meantime, if you want a solid phone HTC has several good offerings you can choose, so does Motorola. Motorola sadly doesn't have anything available on T-mobile, or I'd buy that. I think they offer the best overall platform with LG in a close second. Nexus being ideal for people who use custom ROMs.   NEVER Samsung!!! NEVER EVER EVER!  Options:  It also helps Apple, Android companies competing in the Android market, which is much larger and therefore has more profits, test things out that Apple can then sit back and go "hmm, interesting, so people LOVED that, didn't give a shit about that and absolutely HATED that, our next phone will reflect this". Sure, it means Apple will always be a couple years behind, but it also means their customers get stable features on a totally controlled platform with no options or customization, just like those customers want.   What I'm not as clear on is where Windows phone fits in, their development cycles are slower than Android but faster than Apple. Their hardware is more diverse than Apple but no where near as diverse as Android. The options, features, and customizations they offer are greater than Apple but not even close to Android. Best case scenario they steal a few customers from Apple who want more features and a few from Android who want less customization (something that thoroughly baffles me, options:). Worst case scenario no one uses it and Microsoft just stops offering it.  ||||| Android person here, with a Galaxy Note 3...with TouchWiz.  I very much prefer Android because it is customizable.  I make my own widgets, play with installing custom ROMs, and can do things like install adblock after rooting my phone.  iOS is way too locked down for me. It seems stifling.  ||||| [empty] ||||| BB10 because the hub is the most efficient. It can also run android apps sometimes better than on some Androids. ||||| Blackberry guy here.  I prefer physical buttons to touch typing, and nobody else really gives me any options.  In fact I have a newer issue Bold, and it is touchscreen on the top half, but I prefer using the trackpoint, as it 'feels' like a mouse to me, which just makes more sense to how I'm used to running a computer. ||||| Android all the way. Rooted my phone as soon as I got it and I can do virtually anything I want with the software. I absolutely love it. I hate being held back from doing what I want with the technology I spent hundreds of dollars for.  ||||| I use Android because I like having the ability to adjust and tweak things if I feel like it.   iOS being closed and "neat" seems nice on initial inspection, but the lack of "do whatever I want"-ability is massively off-putting. (I'm also not a fan of Apple's business practices.) ||||| I'm an android kind of guy, I want to be able to hack the guts out of anything I own. That way I can remove any bloat-ware and have a clean device in my pocket.  I personally like sony mobiles, used to go nowhere with out a psp, I guess this was a natural progression. I use the xperia go, cost me £40 is waterproof and runs a charm with some tweaks. ||||| i have a blackberry q10.  suck it. ||||| I use an iPhone. I've used them since the first one came out. (I remember I was able to buy one refurbished on the Apple Store site, and I had 2 $50 Apple Store credits from a class action lawsuit because of the batteries in the 3rd generation iPods, so I only had to shell out like $50 I think. Coolest kid in school right here.) before that I had a blackberry pearl.   I can't say I've ever used an Android phone, so I don't have any comparison, but I've been satisfied with all of the iPhone's I've had and have always had an incredibly easy time with support at the Apple Store. They usually send me away with a new phone.  When I bought my newest iPhone, I took some time to think about it's use to me in my life. As in, I keep this tool on me at all times, how can I make it as efficient and relevant to me as possible. It seems to me that a lot of people went from standard phones to the smart phones most people have now, and never thought of them as a tool. I got rid of apps I don't use (or didn't need to use), kept the ones I did, organized everything else, and sought out useful ones. I'll jailbreak it when it's released and tweak it a bit more.   I bought a new MacBook Pro over the summer, and turned my old macbook (I've had it since May 2006) into a media center using xbmc, and can use my phone as a remote. I enjoy the connectivity of it all, although I know you were just mentioning mobiles OSs.  ||||| I've been using android since the nexus 1, but I'm starting to get a bit pissed off with how inconsistent everything still is, even years later ||||| I don't have a cell phone. It's an expense I just don't need. "But what about emergencies when out on the road?!" I don't drive, either. My workplace is a twelve minute walk from my house, the grocery store is fifteen. Hell, even the Chinese food place is only twenty minutes away. I live inside a small circle and I love it.  Besides, the last thing I want is for people to call me up and blather on about their boring lives when I'm already living one. ||||| I'm an Android guy. However, I do see your point of certain Android phones being bog down from unnecessary software and apps. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and when it came out it was the fastest smartphone on the planet for two months. Now its slow as a pig and can't do very much because of TouchWiz. I do love the long battery life though.  Really, the problem isn't Android but the phone makers itself. I love Android for it's open source architecture and you can modify the OS to suit your needs. There are plenty of phones that are quick and minimal with long battery life like the Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and other slightly modified phones. However, marketing is a powerful tool for businesses and companies like Samsung, Apple, Motorola, etc are trying to increase their market share however they can.   My next phone is going to be the Nexus 5, because of pure Android and the Nexus 6 is too big. ||||| I just get what works and won't cost me an arm, leg, liver and kidney to use off-contract. Oh... sounds like android. I do not really use my phone for more than calling texting, music and some video. Android does exactly what I need without taking half my body.  ||||| An iphone 4 with a cracked screen, prepaid (can turn on internet for $0.50 per day). Also turned off every notification, i'll check it when I want to.   I own the phone, the phone does not own me.  ||||| old symbian phone. i just need a handful of apps on it, mostly ssh client.  plus, it has physical keyboard. ||||| I use Android. I'm actually boycotting Apple. I don't like their creepy zombie fanboys, I don't like how they are way overpriced, I did not appreciate that time they rootkitted my computer, the App Review Guidelines are the snottiest thing I have ever seriously seen a company publish, and I don't like the way they treat their app developers. At one point I had a job that was mostly managing the approval process of apps into the app store, and that is where I really learned to hate them. One time my boss forced me to open a ticket with their developer support, which was next to useless. I prefaced my call with "I have read the App Developer Guide and the button it describes isn't there." The first thing out of the tech's mouth was, "Well I haven't read the App Developer Guide". Yeah. No.  They opened a ticket. I waited a day before I fixed the problem myself. Heard back from them *two weeks later* and they were like "looks like it's fixed! closed!" No shit. Because I fucking fixed it myself.  **tl;dr - Fuck Apple.** ||||| I'm getting to age where I just want sht to work, so I will pay extra for something pre set up or just works. time is money at this point. I am sick of fixing Win7/Android/linux/etc - used to enjoy it but now after an 10 hour shift I just want to watch netflix and sleep.  so for me? iOS/Apple. email? boom. turn off. done. ||||| I like iOS system. For it's simplicity, esthetics and intuitive interface. It just works and never freezes. Some say that many features were available on Android long before they were on Apple and they are right but Apple can really get the user experience spot on and that's what I really like about it. ||||| I use iOS. I have since Apple released the ipod touch 1st gen.   Thinking about leaving. I like iOS but i'd rather have a better phone and apple let me down with the iPhone 6.
6060	1,3,3	5	My fellow Redditors,   Tonight (8/25) my volleyball team is going to make a go at our first championship @ Marikka's on Southland.  If you've never been, it is a great place with good German food and an incredible selection of beer.    Anyway- if you are looking for something to do tonight about 11ish, might I suggest that you grab as many friends as you can and enjoy the beautiful weather with a craft-brew and cheer *loudly* for Rebel Scum, the awesomest volleyball team ever.    The unexpected cheering section will elate my friends and confuse our enemies.    TL; DR Come to Marikka's on Southland before 11pm tonight and cheer for Rebel Scum, Drink and be merry!  ||||| I love coming to those and watching people who have their backs to the volleyball get hit in the head by stray balls.   But unfortunately I will be attending a bachelor party and wont be able to make it. Good luck!  ||||| I was there.   My friend's team got second.
2749	1,3,3,3,3	6	I work in warehousing and I don't really have anything to claim back on tax (as far as I know). Is it worth doing my own tax online? Am I likely to screw myself out of a larger return in any way? ||||| Nope - use etax.  If you read it and take the time to answer properly you wont miss much. ||||| I can [almost certainly] guarantee that eTax will be the better (and cheaper) option for you. The very first time you use it, it's a pain (the UI is not pretty), but once you're setup it's pretty straightforward. And most of the time you'll just be clicking "No, this doesn't apply to me", so it's quicker than it looks at first glance.  There are *some* things you may not be aware of yourself (e.g.: you can claim up to $150 of "work clothing laundry expenses" as a deduction item, without having to provide receipts) but - for 99% of people - this isn't going to affect the bottom line either way. Certainly not compared to the expense of paying an actual accountant.  So unless you have some complicated stock holdings, or international affairs, etc, eTax will be just as good as a real person. Or better, because it's free!  **EDIT** The real bonus is that it can automatically 'pre-fill' large chunks of data by finding your bank account, medicare claims, etc. As /u/complex_reduction points out though, this data won't necessarily be available for *everyone* at the exact same time. There's no harm in trying it out now, but you might have to wait a few weeks for it to get anything. ||||| First time will be a bit of a pain getting use to it, but worth it.  The etax will download all your income (salary and any bank int) for you.  In you situation all you have to do is add your work and education expenses.   ||||| The online version is etax. offline manual forms are Tax pack. Seriously, it's pretty easy. It can get confusing because they ask a lot of questions, but it's usually know if you are a regular employee.

8095	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2	40	Alright, so basically i need help choosing a keyboard. One of my few questions are which keyboard switch is the best for RTS in general. I heard that black is great for FPS, blue for typing and stuff. But i want to know which is the best for RTS. Now my next question is about the Das's student discount. Would a high school student card work? Cuz im still in high school :P. Any help will be much appreciated and any mechanical keyboard suggestions will also be awesome. ||||| Its very up to personal preference..  I have a 6gv2 (blacks) and a filco tenkeyless with browns, I've also used a few boards with blues..  The blacks are great if you really want to bash the keyboard, they're pretty still and it really feels like you've done something when you bottom them out. They're good if you're the type of person thats going to bottom out all the time anyway..  The browns are great if you want to feel like you're typing with finesse, if you learn not to bottom out, they're pretty quiet..  Blues, probably the best for typing, I personally don't like they for starcraft, they feel really nice till I go to double tap a control group or something, then they just feel kind of weird to me.. But like I said, it's all very personal.. ||||| Like some others said the Steelseries 6gv2 is a good option, cheap and extremely durable. I've got a Razer Blackwidow with blue switches myself and I'm loving it. It's my first mechanical keyboard and I got it only about two weeks ago. I've become quite a lot faster by just switching to a mechanical keyboard, going from a low profile key membrane crap keyboard. Your cheapest and best bets in the lower price range are definitely the Blackwidow (non-backlight) and the 6gv2. ||||| brown switches on a das keyboard, they arent too loud, work perfect especiall yin college, and you can get a student discount if you mail them a picture of a student i.d. ||||| Get  Ttesports Meka G1, best keyboard ever.  ||||| Its entirely about opinion. I have a 6Gv2 with blacks and love it, while my friend has White alps that are clickier than hell and he really likes those. I have no trouble typing and he has no trouble with FPS. Try them both out.  Dont get a BlackWidow. If you do wind up liking blacks, get a 6Gv2. They are less expensive and the difference in quality is negligible. Also consider getting something like a [tenkeyless leopold.]([URL] ||||| Where can you try out mechanical keyboards? I'd love to look into one, but I'm too scared to buy before trying. ||||| [empty] ||||| I just got a IBM Model M and I'm loving it every minute I type with it, but I have to say that it's the most big and ugly motherfucking keyboard I ever used, also it's quite loud. ||||| I heartly suggest browns, because  you use your keyboard like a typist in rts, as opposed to the way you hold down movement keys in fps, the tactile feedback is very useful. I find my browns to be pretty noisy, but I'm still bottoming out, but I still feel blues would be obnoxiously loud for the people around me. Mechanical keyboards are the bomb, I doubt you would regret any decision you make in regard to one. I doubt das will take the highschool id, I have a das silent, and while it is spectacular, considering it uses the EXACT same keys  as the much cheaper ones I would suggest getting a cheaper keyboard. Remember, the switches are all made by the same company, so it really doesn't matter too much where you get your board ||||| I have a 6gv2... for that much of a discount, it's a great keyboard. (Even as an into board to mechanical, it's great for the price.)  2cents. ||||| I just ordered a Das with the student discount. I dunno about high school, send an email to their support page an ask. ||||| Personal preference; I use a BlackWidow Ultimate and the cherry blues are wonderful, some people complain about cherry blues... but I have no trouble. The backlighting is cool too especially if you like playing in the dark like me.  Das is great too, but no media keys, which isn't too much of a problem since there's programs for that. ||||| IBM Model M -- Pretty cheap on ebay (about $30) and keeps your girlfriend awake while you game.    Also, this:  [URL] -- probably the best guide to keyboards in the universe  ||||| I use a filco majestouch tenkeyless with black cherrys. It is awsome. I used to game with a blue cherry Das, but I like the blacks a lot more for gaming. The fact that blues and browns are better for typing does not mean that blacks are bad. I do alot of programming and i still like using black cherrys.   The Cherry G80-3000 is one of the least pricy of the mechanical keyboards.   The cherry switches are great, but you should also look at a keyboard using the Topre switches (like the realforce). They kind of have the same feel as black cherrys, but different. :) They are like rubber domes, but good.  ||||| Well I just found out that Steelseries is having a sale, 30% off any of there merchandise until the 12th... and with everyone pretty much suggesting the 6gv2. You guys think I should get it?
2339	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	I was bored and searched for Proactiv's reviews on Acne.org (I know, should've done this *before* I bought the product, but I bought into the hype), which are almost overwhelmingly negative. Many reviews say that after a month or two it stops working, and actually gets worse.  So, who here has used/has previously used Proactiv for a period of time, and what were the results?  **Edit:** Thanks for the responses, everyone. I really appreciate the honesty! I did see SOME improvement for the first week or so of use, but after that it kinda levelled off and made parts of my face feel a little rouch and itchy. Gonna switch over to the Clean and Clear continuous acne control cleanser which has had great reviews all around (and not as expensive!) as well as a moisturizer. Thoughts? ||||| Absolutely stop taking it. It's a waste of money. You're just lining celebrity's pockets. Don't listen to them because they don't care about you. I'm not saying that it doesn't work, but you may as well buy a generic benzoyl peroxide topical product which will do the same thing and cost a lot less.  It depends how bad your acne is on how effective it will be. The less severe, the more likely it is that benzoyl peroxide will work. I think it's definitely worth a try, but if it hasn't worked within a month or so or if it stops working then go and see a GP or dermatologist, preferably a dermatologist.  Sorry if this comes off harsh. I'm in a really bad mood today. ||||| I used it. Only worked for about 1 month and stopped. It made my face very oily. If you've seen the commercials for it, they're all celebrities, which is kind of dumb. It's more of for-profit than actually caring for their consumers. I suggest you talk to a dermatologist for acne products.  ||||| proactiv did nothing for me. I was trying to give it time to work, but after 3 months and virtually no results, I was going to stop wasting money on a useless product ||||| It's the only product I've been able to see actual results from. But like other people said, it stops working after awhile.  ||||| I actually tried Proactiv twice, once in high school and once as an adult.  It didn't really work in high school, but I figured that was probably because I wasn't very careful about following the regime exactly.  But it didn't help when I tried it more recently, either... not any more than your average OTC treatment does.  It depends on the person, just like everything else, but for me it wasn't worth the crazy expensive price.  I *will* say that their Refining Mask (sulfur) works wonders for me.  You can buy it on Amazon for pretty cheap, too.  It does a super job for reducing the size and severity of existing blemishes, especially if I apply it as a spot treatment and leave it overnight.  Again, results will vary from person to person, but I think it is worth giving it a shot. ||||| It didn't work for me at all. Dried my skin out bad too. ||||| I've used it on and off for years. It always *helped* but never actually came close to eliminating my acne. I stopped buying the kits because I didn't like the toner, and now all I use is the mask (which I buy on amazon.) I tried the generics and didn't like them as much as I liked the actual proactiv, except for one that was great... until it got discontinued at target and became impossible to find and just as expensive to buy online.   The only reason I stopped using the face wash and repair lotion was because I ran out and had decided to give something else a try. I might go back to it sooner or later. ||||| I'd really really really advise stopping. I have had nothing but bad experiences with this company. It made my acne worse than how it was to begin with when I used less frequently. Not to mention that they've overcharged me multiple times and charged my account for new products after I cancelled the first time. Then I got charged again for products and when I called, they said they had no record of my cancellation. They pretty much owe me ~$64 right now for a product *I haven't even received*.

7659	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	12	Hey fellas,  I've been roughly following the C25K program and I'm having trouble completing a 25-minute run. The best I can do is perhaps 20 minutes when I try to run at a slow pace. I have been able to complete the interval days without problem though.  Any advice on getting out of this rut? :) ||||| Easy: don't think of it as a rut! If your body is keeping you at this pace, it's because it's building the muscle, reinforcing cartilage, increasing lung capacity and heart efficiency, etc.    If you really *need* to get out of the rut, you can always try speedwork, but there's a risk of injury involved, and it's worse for beginner runners.    Your body has its own schedule, the C25K is just a guideline. ||||| It's not a rut.   Yesterday: I felt terrible. I ran 8 miles on the gym track anyway. I felt like it was my slowest time ever.   Today: I started my run, felt aweful still. Told myself i'd still do 8 miles. After the first mile, i was flying, feeling awesome, i ran 3 minutes faster than the day prior. Where that came from? who knows. Just keep running each day.  ||||| The barrier at this point is most likely psychological.  Basically, you don't have confidence that the program has given you the endurance to complete the run.  That's hogwash.  But it's also what happened to me.  Here's what I suggest:  The thing that helped me was to set up a special time where I knew I was going to get through it no matter what.  Fuel up the night before, take it easy leading up to the run.  If you are on a reduced calorie diet in conjunction with C25K, take a cheat day the day before the run.  When it's time, get all set (shoes on and everything) then watch [the crawl]([URL]  Step outside and monster the fucker.  Whatever you do, don't keep running the distance and not completing it.  Go back and rerun the prior week if you need to.  Build from success. ||||| I've not done the C25k program, so I'm not sure what the "official" curriculum would suggest for getting stuck. My suggestion, though, would be to just take a few days off -- enough to give your body a break, but not too many that you get out of the habit. (Maybe do some walking or other exercise for a week during the time you would normally run?)  An important part of running is listening to what your body is telling you; in this case, your body might be saying that it needs a bit of a break. Better to go slower than you think you need to and avoid injury, than to push too hard, get hurt, and find yourself unable to continue for several weeks. ||||| I'm on the last week of C25K and running my first 5K on Thanksgiving.  The honest answer is that you might just need to rest and repeat a week.   But I ran into the same issue at the 20 minute mark. I know it's almost cliche, but it is largely mental. Really think about what is keeping you from going further. Are you really in pain? Is this really the most exhausted you have ever felt? Do you really not have what it takes to go a few more minutes? I realized that I did have a bit more. Sure, it would feel good to stop, but man, does it feel better when I finish what I started.  And some days are better than others. If you're feeling good, fueled well and loose, you will rock it.  Good luck! ||||| I think it's probably in your head. If it's your 6th week in you should have no physical limitations holding you back from an extra 5 minutes of running. Map out a distance instead of focusing on a clock. Make your focus reaching that end point. I can't run on treadmills because a clock is ticking away in front of my face and that becomes my focus.
2298	1,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3	27	F/28/5’3”(160cm)/~130lbs(59kg)  I’ve been keeping a written “diary” of my progress since I started lifting and I’ve pared it down a lot because literally NOBODY CARES and at this point the timeline is so long it's kind of absurd.   **PROGRESS** (Working weights, maxes untested)  5/2013 >> 5/2016 (TWO YEARS)  Squat 45 >> [210]([URL]  DL 90 >> [250]([URL]  Bench 45 >> [135]([URL]  OHP 45 >> [85]([URL]  Strict Pullups 0 >> 8   [THE DATA GOODIES]([URL] - graph of my progress with highest working weights and fun notes. Black dots are workouts during which I set some kind of PR (usually rep or volume).  Weight >> Unchanged. I have noticed changes to my body but they aren’t very drastic (my butt has definitely improved tho). [One year progress pics]([URL] - things aren’t a whole lot different since these were taken even though I have gotten stronger. I can’t be bothered to take more progress pics at the moment so take my word for it.   **BACKGROUND**  * Reasonably active childhood (gymnastics when I was younger, soccer in high school, biking to class and yoga in college).  * Raised with decent eating habits and love to cook.  * Have been around the same weight and clothes size since high school, and have always had a more muscular/denser build and bone structure.  * Was very active throughout and after university, ate whatever/as much as I wanted though didn’t look particularly fit or athletic.  * Got an office job with a long car commute in 2012. Transition to sedentary lifestyle was difficult mentally and physically.  * Started noticing that my body composition was changing and didn’t like it, weight went a little over 135. Also just generally missed being active and challenging myself physically.   **TIMELINE**  * Started off in a bootcamp-style group fitness class for six months. This gave a me a foundation of strength and got me used to incorporating exercise into my adult schedule, I also got back down to my high school weight of 130.  * [Built a home gym]([URL] on my enclosed front porch with equipment I bought on Craigslist.  * Followed SL 5x5 (modified to be more like Greyskull LP) April to October 2014.  * Ran Wendler’s 5/3/1 for 1.5 cycles and then got a bad flu and lost a decent amount of weight and strength.  * Started back on my modified SL program and regained strength quickly, surpassing previous rep PR’s on all lifts (coincided with increased protein intake). Decided to stay on the linear progression as long as possible.  * Tweaked my back warming up to deadlift 230 in mid-April 2015, deloaded and started thinking about my training differently. ASK ME ABOUT HOW MUCH I LOVE BIRD DOGS. 12 months post-injury and my back is doing great.  * Began running Wendler’s 5/3/1 again in June 2015 and have basically been running variants of this ever since, progressive slowly but steadily.  * I went on vacation and then got sick this past February and that has turned into more of a setback than I was expecting because I developed some nagging hip pain afterwards that I’ve been working to rehab and I’ve just been able to start squatting and deadlifting again. I haven’t really PR’d since January so that’s frustrating.   **DETAILS**  * Workouts typically last 1-1.5 hours every other day.  * Calories typically between 1700-1800. I prioritize protein and don’t care about my balance of fats and carbs as long as I stay in the range. It gives me flexibility and I like it. I’ve maintained my weight around 130 for 1.5 years. I could be leaner but who cares.  * My current favorite accessories are spoto or paused bench, pullups, rows, single leg romanian deadlifts, and hip thrusts. I try to keep it simple.  * I’m playing with the BenchPolkov variant of 5/3/1 to try and get more comfortable with heavier weights. I’m only on my first week so I can’t really say how that’s going yet.  * I am trying to improve my cardiovascular fitness through fast walking and rowing   **THINGS THAT HELPED ME**  * My husband is insanely supportive even though he doesn’t even lift  * My mom is a Registered Dietician, so I have instant access to great dietary advice.  * I sleep well and I sleep a lot.   **THINGS THAT HINDERED ME**  * Exercise-induced asthma managed with an inhaler that I take before exercise.  * I workout in the evenings after work and on weekends, and have night-meetings multiple times per month that I have to work around. Not a big deal, sometimes annoying.  * Crappy mobility especially in my ankles and back  * Back injury in spring 2015  * Hip bullshit in spring 2016   **GOALS FOR THE NEXT YEAR**  Squat 225  DL 300  Bench 150  Compete in a powerlifting meet  But most of all: Avoid injury and keep progressing  Yay! ||||| Awesome pics.

7269	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	25	I find myself avoiding the term when I refer to the SO I've been with for the longest (and have the most stable relationship with) — in my experience it's made some of my other partners feel inferior. I feel a different sort of love for each person I'm with since they all have their own qualities, but the love I have for my long-term SO has more trust (reliability) involved since we've been together for years. I'm hesitant to use "primary partner" since the definitions seem so hazy.  What's your take on the phrase? ||||| I think someone becomes a primary when they begin thinking about living their lives together - usually around the moving in together sort of point in the relationship.   I think that even mono people do this - they start out as secondaries, and then become primaries later on down the road.   This meshes well with the way that poly people often seem to use "primary" and "secondary" - one's primary partner/s are those one lives with, has a family with, raises children with, etc, whilst ones secondary/s tend to be in the "dating" spectrum somewhere.   I know there are many poly people who refer to having, say, a primary of 8 months and a secondary of 2 months; in my mind, depending on the seriousness of both relationships, they'd both fit more to what I feel a "secondary" might be to me.  That said, everyone's free to use whatever the hell words they want for their primaries/secondaries/tertiaries/fwbs/etc; this is just my view.  I also really hate the implied "primary/secondary" hierachy. Other terms have been thrown around here, including "anchor partner" and stuff, but I don't know. ||||| I don't use the term "primary" in my relationship. I also avoid any ranking words like "second" or "boyfriend #1". Since its just the three of us, it's easy to use names most of the time. Since I've been with one much longer than the other and we are in a registered partnership I do often say "husband" and "boyfriend". I'm looking forward to calling them both husband someday though.  ||||| my personal definition of "primary" is the core of the relationship, that others build on, *but* my ideal relationship would not be a multiple-equals in the home. my ideal is my self and another woman as a core that others build on and can come and go for as long as love exists between all of us. ||||| I don't use it. It makes me feel like a kid ranking their best friends. I use the gender neutral term partner when talking about my relationships that have any sort of commitment. Why do we need to rank people? If there's a time conflict, I do what I can to be fair to the partners I have. There's no automatic win in a tie.   To be fair, I'm not legally bound to any one, and no one I'm partnered with is either. Also, no children involved.  ||||| I hate the term "primary." Really hate it. It seems way too monogamish to me. I have different relationships and experiences with different partners, and different levels of trust, but they're all just as much partners, and I refuse to enshrine different levels into the relationships explicitly like that. ||||| I call my partner of several years my "primary" because I view him as an integral part of my life - when other relationships come and go, when I (or we) have relationships and lovers, at the end of the day, when everything else changes and goes away, I know he will be there with me.  I'm poly whether I'm seeing other people or not, and our relationship structure allows for that.  Of course this is my personal experience, but when I was single, I loathed "primary" and "secondary" as terms for relationships - everyone was equal in my eyes, and why would it ever be different?  But then I made a commitment to be with a person I loved - to communicate and to work through things and to be considerate of their life plans and hopes and feelings, and I couldn't pretend I was just a single person in a relationship with someone, I had a primary partner whose happiness was just as important to me as my own.   ||||| My primary is the man that I want to spend my whole life with, the one I hope to grow old with.  I love my secondary partner dearly and consider him my best friend, but I feel certain that our dynamic won't last forever, we are too different.  I hope he one day finds a primary who he can care about and build a life with the way that my primary and I have done. When he finds his primary I believe that I will be ecstatically happy. Hopefully she doesn't hate me or see me as a threat, but if she made him feel secure, loved and eager to plan a future together then I just couldn't be mad about the circumstance. Everyone deserves a primary to grow old with, that kind of love is separate from sexual and friendship love.  To me there is only one primary, I know it's different for others, but for me I only care about making it all of the way to the end of my days with this one man. ||||| Right now it's easy for me because my primary and I are married. But I feel that maybe I may switch primaries lately sooooo there might not be a point in ranking at all. ||||| I look at the title of primary more as a role rather than a ranking. It doesn't imply "better" or "best".  ||||| Why does it have to mean just one? There is no reason it can't be "primary partners".  If one takes a ACL view of all interpersonal relationships(as one who is poly should), a primary will be one in which very significant and notable values fall into the trusted category. With this view, there is no reason it can't be more than one, but regardless of how many it will be very few.  ||||| It would be disingenuous of me to say that I don't privilege my fiancée among my partners. She gets the bulk of my time, and I hers, though we're careful to make time for each other's. metamours.   However, calling her "my *primary* partner" doesn't connote exclusivity. If we were monogamous I'd just be calling her "my *partner*". ||||| My husband and I are legally married, live together, have a child, have combined finances, etc.  So, we consider our relationship to be "primary" and all others to be "secondary".  If for no other reason, this is just a reflection of the fact that our lives are so intertwined - much more so than with any of the other people we are/have been with.  We also practice "partner privilege," where either of us can "veto" potential partners.  So, my husband is definitely my "primary" partner, and I am not at all shy about using that term.

9469	1,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,2	31	So with Speedroids becoming a more complete archetype, I decided to do a deck discussion and in-depth deck description. A good portion of this is copied from my deck R/F I posted a few days ago, but it's mostly for information purposes. I also heard this archetype is part of the anime, but I haven't seen any of it so I'm not sure. That probably means this archetype will get some more support eventually so that's cool.   **WARNING**: This is a long post.    * * *      In terms of what Speedroids can do, they:   1) are great searchers. They can search out their own monsters from the deck to the hand or special summon from the deck to the field (with certain restrictions).   2) have effects that allow them to special summon themselves, giving them great swarm potential.   3) are good at recycling. They can special summon from grave and are able to bring their monsters back using their spell card.   4) have machine synergy, so machine support helps them really well.    The deck relies heavily on special summoning from the deck and extra deck, however, and can be easily stopped by such things as Vanity's/Majesty's Fiend, Vanity's Emptiness, Winda, Unicore and other such things like that. But most decks get hindered by these cards regardless.    Offense (ability to swarm and deal damage): 7   Due to low attack boss monsters, they can't get over many of the meta's big boss monsters, but they make up for it with additional effects (i.e. piercing, double attack, burning). Their ability to swarm the field is excellent though.   Defense (ability to react to opponent's plays): 4   Doesn't have any archetypal support that can prevent them from being destroyed, banished, bounced, etc. No spells/traps that protect them so resorting to staples is a must. Dhama can resummon itself as a decent wall to prevent yourself from losing.   Utility (ability to search and recycle): 8   Lots of ways to get your monsters out from the deck, whether on the field or in your hand. Also has tools to recycle your monsters in the grave and the banished zone.      * * *      **Speedroids**      Monster | Lvl/Atk/Def | Effect | Application :--------------------|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------: Speedroid Beigomax | Level 3 WIND Machine-Type ATK 1200 DEF 600 | You can only use the (2) effect of “Speedroid Beigomax” once per turn. (1) If you control no monsters, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). (2) When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can add 1 “Speedroid” monster from your Deck to your hand, except “Speedroid Beigomax”. | Can special summon itself to trigger its search effect. Can search out Taketonborg for an easy wind synchro play.   Speedroid Double Yoyo | Level 4 WIND Machine-Type ATK 1400 DEF 1400 | (1) When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 Level 3 or lower “Speedroid” monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it. | Good at bringing our Speedroids back from the grave for more summons and is our only Speedroid that requires a normal summon.   Speedroid Red-Eyed Dice | Level 1 WIND Machine-Type Tuner ATK 100 DEF 100 | (1) When this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can target 1 “Speedroid” monster you control, other than “Speedroid Red-Eyed Dice”, and declare a Level from 1-6; the Level of that monster becomes the declared Level until the end of this turn. | Our only tuner at the moment. Searchable tuner using Taketonborg, makes easy synchro plays with his effect to manipulate the levels of other Speedroids.   Speedroid Taketonborg | Level 3 WIND Machine-Type ATK 600 DEF 1200 | You can only Special Summon “Speedroid Taketonborg(s)” once per turn. (1) If you control a WIND monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). (2) You can Tribute this card; you cannot Special Summon monsters for the rest of this turn, except WIND monsters, also Special Summon 1 “Speedroid” Tuner from your Deck. | Sets up synchro plays with his ability to grab Red-Eyed Dice. Easy to special summon since the majority of our monsters are wind, searchable through beigomax.   Speedroid Ohajikid | Level 3 WIND Machine-Type ATK 1000 DEF 200 | (1) When this card is Normal Summoned: You can target 1 Tuner in either Graveyard; Special Summon it to your side of the field. Immediately after this effects resolves, Synchro Summon 1 WIND Synchro Monster from your Extra Deck by using only this card and that Special Summoned monster as materials. | Would be better if it was a level 4, in my opinion. Its ability to take a tuner from *either* player's graveyard is a neat trick. Because the synchro summon effect is immediate, you can't use the effect of Red-Eyed Dice.  * * *    **Speedroid Synchros (Synchroids)**    Monster | Summoning Requirements | Lvl/Atk/Def | Effect | Application :--------------------|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------: Highspeedroid Dahma | 1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters | Level 6 WIND Machine-Type Synchro Effect Monster ATK 2200 DEF 1600 | If this card attacks a Defense Position monster, inflict piercing battle damage to your opponent. You can only use each of these effects of "Hyperspeedroid Dahma" once per turn (1) You can banish 1 Machine-Type monster from your Graveyard; inflict 500 damage to your opponent. (2) If this card is in your Graveyard and your control no cards: You can Special Summon this card. You cannot Normal Summon/Set during the turn you activate this effect. | Lots of potential for poking your opponent down. Has piercing and a small burn effect. Makes a decent wall with its ability to resummon itself from the graveyard and Speedroids can work around the restrictions.     Highspeedroid Chanbarider | 1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters | Level 5 WIND Machine-Type Synchro Effect Monster ATK 2000 DEF 1000 | You can only Special Summon “Hyperspeedroid Chanbarider(s)” once per turn. (1) This card can make a second attack during each Battle Phase. (2) At the beginning of the Damage Step if this card battles: This card gains 200 ATK. (3) If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 of your banished “Speedroid” cards; add it to your hand. | Our newest Highspeedroid. Very capable of OTKing. Works well with Dhama by bringing back a banished Speedroid when it gets sent to the graveyard.    **Notable Wind Synchros**      * [Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]([URL]   Amazing effect negation and destruction for monsters level 5 and higher.    * [Stardust Dragon]([URL]   A classic. Good anti-destruction and can go into Shooting Star, who is also wind.    * * *    **Speedroid Spells**      Spell | Type | Effect | Application :--------------------|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------: Speed Rebirth | Normal Spell Card | (1) Target 1 “Speedroid” monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it. (2) You can banish this card from your Graveyard, then target 1 “Speedroid” monster in your Graveyard; add it to your hand. You cannot activate this effect during the turn this card is sent to the Graveyard. | Use this to return a Double Yoyo for graveyard plays, return a Beigomax if you need to search, or a Red-Eyed Dice for synchro plays. It's ability to recycle Speedroids is amazing.    * * *   **Cards to Include**   *Important Cards*      * [Genex Ally Birdman]([URL]   I think Birdman is very very good in this deck. So much so that it should be a staple in the deck. It can bounce ANY Speedroid back to your hand and gives you a level 3 tuner. An easy Clear Wing or Dhama.    * [Limiter Removal]([URL]   A machine archetype. Boosting them is always good.    * [Iron Call]([URL]   It's good for furthering xyz and synchro plays, but the negation hurts a bit. Still a good card.    * [Soul Charge]([URL]   Amazing for Speedroids and triggers their effects like crazy. Good recovery and OTK potential, not to mention can be a big combo piece.    * [Foolish Burial]([URL]   Helps set up Iron Call, Soul Charge and Double Yoyo.    * [One for One]([URL]   Sets up Double Yoyo, brings out Red-Eyed Dice.

And after I saw that Ohajikid card I thought that this deck is going to be one of the best synchro decks. Not only is it amazingly consistent with its mass amount of utility but it also has amazing synchro monsters that recycle cards from each other effects. Dahma banishes then Chanbarider gets them back. Also if Dahma gets killed and you have no monsters you can just bring him back for free. And while you cannot normal/set summon during the turn you activate this effect doesnt mean you can't special summon more monsters. I think this deck will be an incredibly powerful yet sadly overlooked deck. I, however, will look into it and probably play it. ||||| I've found that running silpheed has great synergy with chanbarider by banishing whatever you want after/before you've made it. To my knowledge there should be three more monsters, being a lv3 tuner, lv4 defensive hand trap and another lv 4. Once we have the lv 3, pilica with e-tele may be a good option since she can basically do what ojakid does when she's special summoned as well as normal summoned. ||||| For Supercharge, I think you mean battle phase not draw phase :)  Thanks for the writeup! I've been wondering about the speedroids and this has helped out a lot :) ||||| Quick question. Do they count towards "-roid" fusions and support?  ||||| I feel like mixing these with Symphonic Warriors might have some merit, especially with {{Symphonic Warrior Guitaar}}'s summoning fodder for XYZ and synchros. ||||| Wow, nice topic bro Congratz :D ||||| Favorite play with the deck is Dharma with Red Eye to make BRD, nuke, and SS Dharma. Props if you have Speed Rebirth too and can fetch Chanbarider because it's so strong! ||||| Do these guys count as "roids" ||||| I've been recently testing this via proxys and the deck has a huge problem in that you need to open Beigomax or you'll slowly start running out of resources. Everytime you do open him though game's go super well, first turn Totem Bird followed into Synching into whatever generic level 2-7 synch you need, drop Blackrose, Moonlight, Goyo, Armades or Clear Wing. One of the best combos against a random rank 4 spam deck is: Special BeigoMax, Search Double Yoyo, Normal Yoyo to bring back Dice, Use Dice and Beigo to synch into Cthugha, bounce all Rank 4s, use Cthugha and Yoyo to Xyz to generic rank 4 that's useful at the moment, draw a card. ||||| I slipped a mask change 2 and divine wind into this deck and it works well enough ||||| No mention of Genex Ally Axel?

3970	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	As a player in 4 campaigns, and a DM in a fifth i have seen darkvision interpreted in many different ways, which can be frustrating when joining a new campaign and can never be sure if darkvision will work as you assume it will. For example:  1. I handle darkvision in such that: in combat, you do not have disadvantage when attacking targets within 60 feet that are in darkness. Also, OOC, you can see shapes/figures within 60 ft., but can only make out specific (such as colors) if there is atleast dim light. 2. A DM i play with allows any creature to hide/stealth in darkness. Which is cool, but creatures with darkvision cannot see these creatures without *active* perception rolls, even in combat, even if they are 10 feet in front of them with nothing blocking LOS. 3. Another DM, one whose campaign I've recently left, treats darkness with disadvantage, even with darkvision. So a wizard shooting a fire bolt at a creature 40 feet away will have disadvantage. 4. A close friend of mine, who got me into D&D in the first place, pretty much treats darkvision as truesight in that you can see perfectly in the dark. ||||| Darkvision lets you treat dim light as bright light and no light as dim light out to 60ft (or your darkvision range which may vary) with the caveat of not being able to discern colours.  Dim light is treated as lightly obscured. Lightly obscured gives the following conditions:  * Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  That's it.  That's all that mechanically happens RAW.  All this is neatly packaged up on page 183/184 of PHB.  Specific to your points..  1. Correct. 2. Incorrect(ish).  You can alway attempt to hide, but doing so in plain sight is meaningless unless something special lets you do so (like wood elves). 3. Incorrect(ish).  Only disadvantage is on visual perception.  That means stealth works better because you're harder to spot.  Once spotted however there are no penalties on attack rolls (of which fireball has none anyways). 4. Incorrect. ||||| >Another DM, one whose campaign I've recently left, treats darkness with disadvantage, even with darkvision. So a wizard shooting a fireball at a creature 40 feet away will have disadvantage.  Okay, this is outside the scope of the conversation, but there's no advantage/disadvantage with spells that have a saving throw, such as fireball.  There are situations, such as being cursed, that can give the targets disadvantage on the saving throw, but nothing that would give the wizard disadvantage when casting the fireball.   ||||| >You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  >In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  >A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.  So in darkness with darkvision you treat it as dim light, it only modifies Wisdom(perception) checks by giving them disadvantage. Remember disadvantage on passive checks is a -5 penalty, so passive perception is 5 lower than normal.  No other penalties to combat rolls.  Edit: Also lightly obscured *might* be enough to hide, this like much of the stealth rules/guidelines are pretty vague and open widely to DM interpretation.   ||||| I think some of this depends on the ammount of time being spent in the dark, and the number of players with darkvision.  When I have a party that pretty much all have darkvision, and the campaign is spent mostly in the dark, I will tend to treat it much like truesight to a limit of 60 feet (or whatever their darkvision is) with a caveat that any characters without darkvision have to keep in mind whatever their lightsource is, and be ready to explain it to me at any time.  I'm not looking for a "gotcha", just more along the lines of "if you have  a torch in one hand and your weapon in the other then you can't use your weapon as versatile." I think that harsher darkvision rules work better when darkness is rarer AND they affect more characters.  With darkvision being more common than not among the races of 5e, and the storylines thus far having a fair amount of darkness, I think that treating it too strictly takes the fun out of the other aspects of the game, because it's suddenly all about darkness, at least for certain players. ||||| Well, PHB specifies that character's with Dark vision can see up to the limit as if the darkness was only dim light. It means they get disadvantage on perception checks that rely on sight and can't discern color.  So really they could fight an orc or something obvious, but anything with an active check to see something should be made at disadvantage, even something directly in front of them. Other than that RAW don't offer anything.   But yeah, I treat it like you're in a dark but not completely dark room where you can see, probably even read, but it's much harder to make out anything that isn't an obvious shape.  ||||| The Vision and Light section of the PHB (pg. 183) covers all this pretty clearly.  * **Lightly obscured** areas give disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight. Dim light, among other things, counts as a lightly obscured area.  * **Heavily obscured** areas are equivalent to the Blinded condition (Appendix A); ability checks requiring sight automatically fail, your attack rolls have disadvantage, and attack rolls against you have advantage (barring any mitigating circumstances). Darkness, among other things, creates heavily obscured areas.  When you have darkvision, areas of dim light within 60 feet are treated as bright light (so no longer obscured therefore no more disadv. on Perception checks) and areas of darkness within 60 feet are treated as dim light (heavily obscured gets downgraded to lightly obscured). By this logic, DM #3 is wrong to impose disadvantage in your hypothetical scenario. In fact he's doubly wrong because Fireball doesn't require an attack roll; you simply choose a point of origin and BOOM! Fireball.  DM #2 is effectively allowing creatures to attempt to hide in dim light (i.e. attempt to hide in darkness from a creature with darkvision). This is something that would normally only be possible with the Skulker feat, though it's worth noting that Wood Elves and Lightfoot(?) Halflings can also hide while lightly obscured, albeit only under specific conditions (in natural phenomena and behind larger creatures, respectively). Stealth is normally handled as a check vs. a DC of the *passive* Perception of the creature(s) from which you're attempting to hide, though the Search action would allow a creature to make an active Perception check on their turn. If you're hiding while only lightly obscured, DM #2 should imo at least be factoring (dis)advantage into the relevant checks.  DM #4 isn't straying terribly far from RAW, but he is straying. The things he's ignoring with his version of darkvision are (1) color vision in darkness and (2) disadvantage on sight-based Perception checks. This is relatively minor, imo, but it is not how the rules are neither written nor intended.  I would say that DMs 2 and 4 have reasonable house rules for making Stealth easier (or minor misintepretations of the rules that don't break the game) and shouldn't be too problematic as long as all players know and understand how these DMs are treating Stealth, vision, etc. DM 3 made my eye twitch. ||||| As an oddity and possibly outside the scope of your question, I also rule some other aspects of Darkvision that aren't...ahem... necessarily anywhere in the rules:  Characters with Darkvision in complete darkness cannot determine the properties of items by sight alone.  Because there is no light information, there is no reflective information to be had.  Metals have no luster, liquid surfaces have no sheen, no colors are discerned, mirrors don't mirror, etc.  The world is a flat shaded monotone that is rather alien to our normal vision.  I...um... also give Disadvantage on Investigation Checks (sight) due to these limitations.  But that is completely HOUSE RULED.  I, in no way, endorse that this is RAW.   ||||| I have always done dark vision the same as night vision goggles. You get tunnel vision (thus disadvantage to sight), but you can discern simple features, like noses and numbers of fingers easily enough. You can't read any writing unless it was written/carved with dark vision in mind. ||||| Exactly as described in the book. Wow, asking the hard questions here. ||||| Two words...  Magical. Darkness.

7734	1,3,3,3	8	I recently flew to China and I knew that it would be much harder to keep momentum due to a language barrier and my disinterest in the women there. But I did it anyway.   Excerpt #1:   It was fucking cold, goddammit, and I was waiting for a bus. I saw a very cute caucasian girl waiting on the other side of the bus terminal and it was really not in my interest to move, let alone approach at that point. Thoughts like "she probably doesn't speak English" and "she probably doesn't want to talk anyway" were going through my mind.   A bus comes by and she get's on and I think "oh well I guess that's that", but then she promptly get's off the bus. For whatever reason that triggered me to approach her.   **Me**: Hi, English?  **Her**: Yes, actually!  **Me**: Wow that's pretty rare here. Where are you from?  And we shoot the shit. We had a very pleasant conversation and I had no intention of closing. It was simply to prove to myself that I could approach in any situation.   Excerpt #2:   This was at the airport in Tokyo, Japan during a 6 hour layover. I sat down at an internet café and saw a beautiful girl there. I literally sat for 40 minutes, with two seats in between, mentally preparing myself for the approach before I told my mind to just shut up for two minutes and do it. Again, thoughts like "does she even speak English?" and "what if she's tired and I'm disturbing her peace?" kept popping up.  Same opener, nervous as shit this time:  **Me:** Hi, English?  **Her:** Haha yeah I'm from Austra ---   **Me:** Wait I was going to guess! You have a nice accent.   I don't quite remember most of the conversation as it went on for about two hours, but it involved batman, prawns and the word "cunt". Again, no intention of closing, just getting past approach anxiety in high pressure social situations and seeing how long I could hold a conversation for.   After the first hour and a half, I told her I needed some coffee so I shuffled her to a coffee lounge and from there it kind of started to dwindle and die.

1199	1,3,3,3,3,3,0	14	My coaches in high school would teach us to do shrugs at the top of our (hexbar :  / ) deadlifts. Good idea, or bad? I started doing deadlifts again and found myself almost automatically doing them. ||||| I say don't do them together. If you want to do shrugs, do shrugs, but do them AFTER deadlifts as an accessory to the deadlift.   That said, I have seen cross-fitters do it with very light deadlifts as part of a WOD, and I also saw an Oly coach teaching someone to do that as part of the Clean.   My opinion is just do them separate.  ||||| Once your deadlift weight gets up there high enough, you definitely won't want to do that. It's exhausting enough.  If you want to shrug at the top of a deadlift though and you're able to do so without wanting to die, then more power to ya. ||||| Not for limit sets of deadlifts, but olympic-style weightlifters do a movement called a [clean pull]([URL] that is sort of like a deadlift+shrug. This is done to strengthen the second pull, with a weight that is heavier than your max clean, but lower than a max deadlift. ||||| A lot of people tend to do this unconsciously. I always correct it when I'm teaching strict deadlift form, but it's not going to kill you if you do it. That said, it is not a component of a deadlift, so if you do it you are doing no longer doing a deadlift, but radifferent movement than a deadlift.   It's like when people ask if they can modify X program. Sure, you *can*, and it may work really well for you, but if you do you are no longer doing X program, you're doing something else. Competent programs are designed in such a way that every single component in them is there for a good reason. If you have no good reason to include the modification, then you probably shouldn't.  ||||| For oly lifting, the pull from the floor is part deadlift, part shrug, part jump.    It could be a component of that type of movement...  But if it's just simply do a deadlift, then while standing there locked out, do a shrug too, then thats pretty dumb. ||||| I think your coaches were retarded

By drying off with the towel, the "decapsulation" of the germs occurs when the germy water is absorbed in the towel, making you clean and the towel not clean. ||||| Because towels also absorb hate through your skin, which is why you feel calmer after a good soak. It isn't just the water, it is the hate-absorbing qualities of towels. If you do not wash them, the hate manifests as bacteria and will make you ill the next time you use them. Always wash your towels! ||||| Have you heard of cooties?.  Several tv shows have featured episodes about them and they are most  modern young parents nightmare so I am going to assume that you are familiar with what cooties are.   Basically cooties attach themselves to your bath towels whenever you arent looking and your only chance to fight back against them is washing your towels with high quality powder every time.   High quality powder creates a force field that cooties just can not penetrate.  N.B: Most people are unaware of why you need to clean your towels and they either use cheap powder or the same towel several times.                   *shudder*   It would be really helpfull if you tried to clear people' s misconceptions on this subject since studies show that once someone you know has been infected by cooties your chance of getting cooties is 50% higher unless you just get a restraining order against them.   I am not saying you should but I personally wouldnt judge you if you did ||||| Bath towels are injected with bacteria when they are infants. The reason for this bacteria is to populate the world with bacteria therefore you have to shower more. A scheme in which all the beauty care corporation take part in.

I'd say that my current position does not fully utilize the understanding of algorithms, data structures, and operating systems that my education prepared me for. I had to implement a compiler as one of my assignments in my last year of college.   While I haven't implemented anything of that complexity on the job, I'd say the scope and breadth of what I work on- what internal applications my code touches, as well as downstream consumers of our data- requires that I have an organized approach to my coding. That's certainly something I found in my years in college. I imagine if I were to move to the dev side of things rather than the implementation side, I'd probably use even more of what I learned in college. It really depends on where you go and what you focus on! ||||| Most of what I do on a daily basis is stuff I learned on my own time, both before and after graduation.  I write very specialised software, so it's not like there are courses on what I do for a living. ||||| Writing, writing, writing..

3611	1,3,3	4	Basically it's centrism and authoritarianism combined with an economy where there isn't a proletariat being exploited, since everyone owns some sort of means of production and competes with others to make money and live.   They're opposed to worker exploitation because "If the worker is holding a good, well paying, steady job, he's less likely to want to directly compete with someone else to make money." ||||| How it is possible for everyone to "own some sort of means of production"? Society requires different goods, so all those machines must produce different things that represent different value in exchange. Also, even if the machines are the same (3D printers, so to say), they surely must differ to each other (be newer or older, more worn, be more or less efficient, etc), so that might mean the production would be unequal.  Then comes the problem of… from where do those means come, in order to be available for everyone? You get born, and you family gives you one? That's inheritance, and families with certain economic means will be able to provide differently.  If those aliens live in society, then what would be the reason to own separate means of production instead of bigger, centralized ones (corporations or communal production)?  Do these means provide for each social unit, or do they sell the goods to other? In the first option, then it would be very inefficient to produce everything separately. The second option brings many problems… If everyone has means to produce, that would mean they can live without having to sell their work (because they work in their own houses)… so all exchanges would actually be goods-for-goods exchanges that could bypass money. Owning means contradicts having "a job": they would all work for themselves, independently, without needing bosses outside of the control of their very mean (at most, they would have administrators).  I didn't understood the last sentence. In your world, there are many, many productive units, so it's granted that some producers will produce goods that others are already producing. That makes competition inevitable, because both would be selling the same thing (so one would have to ask for less money in exchange, or rather innovate… then you have the classic capitalist tendency of profit decline).  Well, yours is a very interesting situation, and I'm sure other users can rebate my points or continue the debate.

But all around I've noticed a lot of young Middle Eastern background guys (late teens/early-mid 20s) driving expensive cars, often even cars worth $100k+ like BMW M3s, Mercedes AMGs and even Ferraris and Lambos.  What I want to know is how do they afford such nice cars? Do their parents buy them or something? ||||| Live with parents.

Some people's priorities are different.  ||||| Ask our mate Salim.  But in all seriousness, luxury cars generally depreciate faster than your standard Japanese/Australian cars do, so second hand luxury cars don't cost *that* much, for the price of a new Japanese hatchback you could buy a 4-5 year old BMW 320i, Mercedes C200 or Lexus IS250.  For my next car I am toying with the idea of a 2011-2012 Lexus IS250, as they only command about $25,000 now despite costing $60,000 new. ||||| Most of them are actually leased, not owned. ||||| It's mostly just mixed up priories – live at home and take out a huge loan just to drive around in a flashy car. That or they borrow them to drive around and pretend to have money.

7510	1,3,3,3	6	I (25m) am considering breaking up with my (23f) girlfriend of 3 years. We got an apartment together in April and put both our names on the lease for 9 months. She is from another state and moved up here a year ago after she graduated. We've split both of the furniture costs and both make about the same amount of money. It would be a strain, but possible, for either of us to pay rent by ourselves. I don't want to leave her in a horrible position since she's from out of town.  What things do I need to consider before making this decision?  tldr: I share an apartment with someone i think Im going to break up with. She is from another state. ||||| When I broke up with my ex-fiancée, I told her "you are moving your shit out on Saturday while I go camping. I don't care if it fits your work schedule, and I don't care where you go."  She'd been cheating on me, though, so I felt justified in being heartless. And her folks lived in town, too, so she just moved back in with them.   I know you said you make similar amounts of money, but I suspect that the finances aren't split perfectly evenly. With any luck, you'll end up with more money, rather than less, even without her rent contribution.   ||||| The financial aspect is a side discussion: you need to determine what's best for you. If you're willing to break up and sever the commitments to her, there are a few things you can do:  * [Check with your landlord about updating the lease]([URL] People break up all the time, so this is not an unforeseen event for them. It could easily turn into a negotiation, so be prepared to make a concession or two: paying a bit in advance, increasing the rent, or signing it for longer. Alternatively, you can always pay the penalty to break the lease. * Decide who stays and who goes. Living together likely isn't viable or healthy after a breakup, so be prepared to find an intermediate home for a few days while you sort out property and find a new place for whoever is leaving. If you're the one staying, look for a roommate to share the financial burden with until the lease is up. * If the shared living space gets to you too much emotionally, don't be scared to leave it behind and start fresh! A small financial expenditure is minor in the long run compared to being happy!  As an aside, I have no idea what your relationship situation is, but be wary about giving up too soon. Every relationship you'll have for a long time will have its bad periods: you'll need to work through conflict at some point. Make sure you feel good about your decision if you do break up.  In any case, best of luck to you and her for the future! ||||| Ahh I went through this. It's tough but doable. We broke up in October and our lease wasn't up til May. It was a one bed so neither of is could move out and let the other get a room mate. We took it in turns to take the bed/sofa and would both try and be out or staying with friends as much as possible. So he stayed with a friend for a week, when he came back I went and stayed with my parents for a bit. (Luckily they weren't too far away so I could still get to work)   We just kind of carried on this way until it was time to move out, and I spent a lot more time going for after work drinks so I'd spend less time in the flat. It's clearly not ideal but it can be done.

8189	1,3,3,3,3	14	How the hell do I get through the cravings and wanting to murder people?  I've smoked for 13 years and this is my first time even attempting to quit.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.    Edit:  Thanks for all the feedback and positive words.  I'm on day 2 now and the cravings don't seem as bad as yesterday so that's a good thing.  Almost broke down and smoked last night but my girlfriend thankfully came over and talked me out of it.  She's quitting with me now too.  I also convinced my friend of over a decade to quit as well.  Got a nice little support group now! ||||| Well, apparently the three days after your last is the hard part of quitting. And the next two or three days are gonna be worse for you. I masked my cravings with copious amounts of vodka on Friday & Saturday and if I'm not careful, will end up at /r/stopdrinking.   But seriously, other than that, stay away from triggers that would cause you to think about cigs. When the urge comes up, smile and remind yourself that you don't need nicotine and the reason is because you're not a smoker.  Check out my day counter...i quit dipping 6 days ago and it's still tough, but today is significantly easier than Friday. I know a week from now it will be even easier. Just hang in there for a while, you're doing great! ||||| Here's what helped me, YMMV:  Wherever you bought your smokes? Never go there again. Ever.  That, for me, was a huge trigger to smoke as I went to the same 7-11 every day on my way to work to get that day's cigarettes.  I've started taking walks instead of smoking. I walk once a day for 30-40 minutes to get my head clear and some fresh air. I still spend less time outside than when I smoked and I'm not annoying my coworkers with the stench of smoke. **Bonus**: I'm getting exercise instead of killing myself when I go outside!  Edit: Formatting ||||| Just keep telling yourself this. The cravings are not going to kill you. They will pass. Try and think of it as a game or fight. Personify your cravings and declare victory over each one you overcome.  I'm up to a week of quitting now. I just had a trigger. Normally while studying, I would have a smoke break after a finished a topic. Had a massive craving, but cause I had personified the cravings, I no longer see myself as powerless against them. After a while, its no longer just about quitting cigarettes, but attaining that feeling of power and victory over something.   Let me know if this helps.  ||||| Just power through it.  The despair and bad moods will pass, and quickly become less frequent and less intense.  I've only been smoke-free for a week and I feel better every day. The first three days were hell though. If you can get past that (and you can!), you can make it!
3881	1,3,3	7	Hi everyone,  I spent a fair amount of time here under a different account which I've since (cleverly) lost, and found people to be so supportive.  I've been struggling especially badly since the start of the year, when I had a very low episode triggered by a combination of exam stress and personal issues (I'm 22).  Recently I've gone through a breakup which has left me feeling pretty lost. I'm also feeling a little alone generally as I'm graduating from uni this summer and at the moment feel as though I don't have a lot of purpose. I really miss the guy and I'm finding myself very preoccupied with sad thoughts about everything that was and could have been.  I know it's just a matter of time before the hurt fades, but I'm struggling to get out of bed and keep to my normal level of grooming and stuff...it's especially difficult because I'm living back home now and I feel the need to keep a happy face on as I can't bear the thought of talking to anyone about it.  I was just wondering if anyone has any motivational things that you use to help you get up and started with the day when you're in a low period? I try to remember the whole 'life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it', which helps a small amount, but in my fog at the moment I'm coming up a bit short on things to help me out.  Anything would be really appreciated. Hope everyone's ok tonight x ||||| I don't know that I can offer anything to help on the motivational front.  For me, I try to remember that every day is a new one, and can bring new opportunities.  Just the whole "one day at a time" thing, pretty much.  I really hope that you're able to get through this.  Just wanted you to know there's someone rooting for you!  If you ever feel like talking would help, you can PM any time. ||||| Thanks for the reply. I know you're right, but unfortunately my days are seeming pretty empty at the moment. I'm stuck in the same place with pretty much zero energy or resources to change things.  I'm not sure now much the whole PMA thing can do at this point, to be honest. I just desperately hate the feeling that I'm wasting away days that could potentially contain some happiness. Trying to alter my mindset is the only thing I can think of but I'm struggling so badly to start.  Thanks again for the encouragement, I appreciate it.

8077	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,3	32	see my comment for the most recent survey link  I am looking for players to respond their current age and preferred race in the survey linked above and below (same link). Random is indeed a race choice in this data collection project. I have a spreadsheet with data already in it, and histograms and percentage charts being created off of the data I input.  I am looking for a larger sample size to add to my current data to see if the trends I see now in my charts look the same with a larger sample of players.

1580	1,3,3	4	My wife and I have been together off and on for 3 years. I had an emotional affair and she hasn't ever forgiven me. We are currently separated and she stated she wanted a divorce. Im getting ready to move to Europe for work. I told her yesterday and she broke down into tears. Later into our conversation she asked if we were still getting divorced. I didn't know what to tell her when she asked me this. I don't know what to make of the situation. Communication between the two of us has been  minimal since we separated about 3 months ago. Any ideas on what i should do / say. ||||| You're going to have to talk, amigo.  Only the two of you can determine where you go, so make time for it and tell her you want to work out your path with her.  It can get exhausting, so don't force any marathon sessions, but set dates, talk each evening or however it works best for your calendars.  Face to face. No email or text or phone.  If that includes a counselor, then work that in. And hurry up if you're about to leave. ||||| A marriage that goes off and on for 3 years, and minimal communication for the last 3 months, is in trouble.

Don't sugar coat it . . . you'd only be fooling yourself. If you're the kind of guy that needs variety or novelty in relationships, then own it. If your wife is repressed to the point that she can't/won't fully engage in your relationship, then identify it. I don't pretend to know what the issues are with you two, or whose fault it is, but there ARE issues.   Figure that out, maybe with a counselor, then go to your wife with a plan. Make it clear. Pick one of these or write your own, but set a definitive direction:  1. Yes, we're getting divorced. I'll get the paperwork done. 2. I want this to work, but you must agree to move with me and get counseling. 3. I have XYZ issues that I need to fix. I'm seeing a counselor. I want our marriage to work and I'm giving up the overseas job to stay with you. Please help me.  Don't let it just drag on for months.

1109	1,3,3,3,3,3	10	I will begin the mechanical engineering core classes next year, and was wondering what math topics are utilized most throughout them and to what degree of complexity.  Thanks!! ||||| Definitely (in rough-ish order of difficulty):  * Calc I (Differential) * Linear Algebra * Calc II (Integral) * Calc III (Multivariable) * ODEs * PDEs (particularly the heat equation, I'd assume) * Statistics  Probably:  * Calc IV (Vector Calc) (for EE certainly, not so sure about ME) * Complex Numbers * Probability * Statistical Mechanics (probably counts as Physics though)  I might be misinterpreting the question, but why not just look up your course tables? ||||| Differential Equations. You can nap through most math classes and get by on learning from the textbook, but pay all of your attention to differential equations. Systems of differential equations come up absolutely everywhere, and knowing how to use them and how to solve them is essential ||||| TAKE GOD DAMN LINEAR ALGEBRA AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.  Fucking seriously.  You don't need lin alg straight away, but if you take linear algebra and truly understand it, you can use it to rapidly solve many problems in lower-level engineering classes, chem 1/2, and physics 1/2.  The trick here is you have to understand it well enough to know when you're looking at a problem you can use linear algebra on.  Most students don't actually understand the subject and wouldn't know to use linear algebra if it hit them in the face with a dick.  Systems of equations solved with linear algebra are very simple to check completely.  Next up, get through multivariable/vector calc as soon as possible.  What linear algebra does for speed of solution, calculus brings a deep understanding to the equations you'll see.  Multivariable calc gives you some intellectual tools to think about problems in many different but equivalent ways.  It is much easier to understand any physics or engineering class if you've had calc 3 before physics 1.  Like, much, much easier.  I'd take differential equations as the last of the three.  Introductory DE is hard; there's lots of memorization.  Since you will see both linear algebra and calculus in it, it's wise to be on the best possible footing before you go through DE.  That way, you're only struggling to understand one subject, and not trying to get an introduction to two other subjects at the same time. ||||| It depends on where you are. Most of the mechanics class depend heavily on calculus and algebra. Upper level fluids, system dynamics, Heat Transfer and machine mechanics depend a lot on differential equations.   My advice is to get through ODE's as quickly as possible. Calc 3 and above is largely irrelevant to most engineering coursework outside of EE.  ||||| dunno about degree of complexity, but calculus, linear algebra and series should do the trick. also, get familiar with complex numbers
47	1,3,2,3	8	Hi all, I just got my own desktop 3d printer. Yay! I printed a tiny cuddling owl to test the details. The top half was not bad, but the bottom half had some major droopage.   [URL]  [URL]  What do you suggest I do to fix it, or what do check on? The fan is on, I'm printing at 45 mm/s perimeter, and 60mm/s infill; I used a 20% infill on this print.    I'm using a Ditto+ printer ([URL] that came assembled but used; and I'm using MakerBot filament.   Thanks ||||| I slowed down the print speed from 45 mm/s to 20 mm/s, the results are much better. I also turned on the fan instead of leaving it up to the slicer (though I'm pretty sure the slicer turned it on all expect the first layer).   New version (left) vs. old (right): [URL]  Still not perfect, but definitely an improvement. Thanks all! ||||| What temperature are you printing at? And is the filament ABS or PLA? What are you slicing with as well?  It looks like you are extruding at too high of a temperature. You also need to slow down on the top layers (ie. set minimum layer time to 15 seconds). ||||| Looking at the printer, it doesn't seem like you have a fan. PLA likes being cooled (in comparison to ABS, which does not), so you can reduce drooping by using a 40 mm computer fan.  Also as mentioned, slowing down the print in Slic3r will also help immensely.

7046	1,3,3,3	17	Hello! I did a bit of looking and didn't find much advice for second cards so let me lay it out.   My first credit card was through my local credit union. I got a very good APR, all things considered. I did good with it at first, but then my fiance lost his job. I'm sure you can imagine what happened next in the months he was unemploymed. Ended up with about $2k on that card, no other debt between the two of us. We're down to $1.5k and are paying 3x the minimum payment every month (~$100 I think). We just finished paying a relative for our vehicle and we are going to have some extra cash(several hundred) every month.  I would ideally like to get a second card, transfer a portion of the balance to take advantage of a balance transfer promotion, and pay both down concurrently. I want to get the second card so I can lower my credit utilization quickly as I want to get my credit better before we get married.   So I'm looking for a good second credit card(my scores are 720/680) that I can transfer a portion of a balance to. Is this possible and what card should I look at? ||||| I added topic flair to your post, but you may update the topic if needed ([click here for help](/r/personalfinance/wiki/flair)).

3177	1,3,3	4	Ok so as mentioned I'm new to all of this and I know close to nothing about making a computer. What I want to build is a gaming laptop. Thing is, I've heard that making laptops is rather hard and making a big monitor wouldn't be practical considering I move pretty much every year and I like having my computer portable. Anyway, I would really appreciated it if you guys could help me, I've sorta googled this kind of stuff by searching for a good graphics card (intel core i7) or checking the price and a decent amount of ram (8). However that's more or less the extent of my knowledge, I'd like to know, what do I need other than I'm not aware of and what are the best options for each individual part? I'd also like to know how hard is it to make a laptop, even if I have to take it to a store so they can assemble it.  ||||| >good graphics card (intel core i7)  wat ||||| the problem with building a laptop is that the motherboard does so many things.   1. it has an LCD controller which means you need to use the LCD its meant for.  2. it has the graphics card built in which means that when you buy the motherboard you lock in your graphics card.  3. it has the power board built in 4. the form factor is not standardized which means the casing, keybard touchpad, coolers, etc are all tied to the laptop.   so basically, the best you can do is buy all of the above in one package. then add a CPU, RAM and hard drive.   in that sense its easier than building a desktop.

3028	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	36	I was recently talking with my father about some games we own. We have played games about Gettysburg, WWI, WWII, The Pacific War, the American Revolution, and the Cold War. But we have never played games about recent events.  After what amount of time can a game be made about unfortunate topics like: 9/11, The Holocaust, Assassinations etc? Are games only made about events that have a 'winner', I.e. WWII?   I'm not asking because I want to design a game based around these. I just want to know what others think about this topic. ||||| There are a couple ways I've seen games successfully handle sensitive and emotionally-charged subjects. Let's say, for instance, you want to make a game about getting people out of the Twin Towers before they collapse.    One is to abstract it out really far. This doesn't always work that well. Even if you turn the people into tokens and the building into a chess board, the whole affair will still leave people feeling a bit ill.    Another way is to turn it into a historical simulation. If you put a premium on accuracy, often players will be willing to handle uncomfortable topics for the sake of understanding it. **A Distant Plain**and **Labyrinth** do this well. But for our example game, I still don't think it would cut it. There's nothing to teach. It might make an interesting study in tactics, but the theme will only get in the way of that.    The only game I've seen handle an uncomfortable topic with sentiment and maturity is **Freedom: The Underground Railroad**. If you're looking at making a Holocaust or 9/11 game, I would examine what makes that game work.    But, more importantly, I would ask, "what is this theme really doing for the game." If it's actually posing a barrier to play for some people I would consider dropping it and reframing the game in another setting.  ||||| > After what amount of time can a game be made about unfortunate topics like: 9/11, The Holocaust...?  > At what point is that not seen as horrible? We make games about people killing eachother in war. When does that become okay?  That's a tough question, but a really interesting one. I think a lot of it has to do with how abstracted it is, what attitude (ie, what level of compassion) you bring to the subject, and what your purpose is.  I'm thinking specifically about **Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001-?**, which I haven't yet played, but it has one player controlling the US in its efforts to quash global terrorism, the other person actually controlling jihadists networks. That's potentially a very touchy subject that affects a lot of people around the world, but the game seems abstracted enough that it doesn't feel personal.  But of course it depends on what your intent is, I suppose. Brenda Brathwaite made a game that's as much art project as board game. It's called **[Train]([URL] and it's a bit of a logistics game where your goal is to keep the trains moving to their destination and move as many passengers as possible. Once your passengers reach the destination and you've "won", the reveal is that you've actually sent Jews to Auschwitz. So... that's a game that has a very distinct message it's trying to get across, and it's a game [you won't want to play again]([URL]  It's not a great answer, but it really just depends on the game and the designer's approach. How willing they are to either distance the players from the reality of the event, or to get right into the middle of it. And of course, the compassion for the subject that they bring to the game. ||||| I don't know, but it's not going to stop me playing **Double Jenga** every September. ||||| It depends on how the subject is treated.  A Distant Plain covers the recent, and ongoing, Afghanistan conflict, for instance. It does so in a fairly balanced fashion, without demonising any particular faction, and shows a good understanding of what is happening, and can grant people who don't grasp the nature of the conflict that same understanding.  I'm not convinced The Holocaust would make a good game, perhaps a Euro? ||||| I think it is totally possible to find a way to make it happen if you want.  And it doesn't even have to be educational or informative or even really historically accurate.  Take a look at Manhattan Project for a game about a fairly recent event that didn't happen at all the way the game makes it look like it happened.    I think a game based around the concept of emergency responses to natural disasters would be very interesting.  For example, I could see an interesting game about trying to mitigate the effects of Katrina on New Orleans, half of the game trying to get people to evacuate, getting responses in place and then the hurricane hitting and flooding the city and the game ending after actually responding to the events.  Games about assassinations or espionage could be interesting too where one side is attempting to assassinate a target and the other side is trying to prevent that target from getting killed/helping them escape.  Games like this would fall into territory like Letters from Whitechapel where players are "assisting the bad guy," which some will always find distasteful.   ||||| I don't think it's a function of time, at least that much.  I think it's a function of the events.  In order to make a game out of something, there has to be a clearly defined struggle and it must be possible to win.  This is why wargames are typically easy to accept even if the ashes are still warm.  And it's why a game about the Holocaust or 9/11 won't work:  even the people who survived the Holocaust can't be described in any meaningful way as winners.  What struggles there were on 9/11 happened in places that are opaque to us.  (Like, we don't even have a credible narrative for what narrowly defeating the terrorists would look like.)   ||||| I could see a Holocaust-themed game where you take a role of a famous person who tried hiding and evacuating people being sent to concentration camps and you fight the board (being the nazis) where you try to save the most, or something like that.  ||||| They made CO2 and that didn't stir any controversy at all. ||||| Slightly off-topic but [Hogan's Heroes]( [URL] was a TV sitcom that dealt with German PoWs 20 years after the war ended. Somehow I can't see the same thing being done about 9/11. Does anyone know when the first WWII game came out?  ||||| The sooner the better - it will only get awesome-er with time. Post-9/11, the War On Terror game is more popular than ever. |||||  Because boardgames have physical components, designers would have to be very careful with the subject matter.   I wouldn't say a topic could never be covered, but sensitivity would need to be observed.  That being said, I've found that pen and paper games are able to cover these things really well, since how deep a topic is covered is ultimately up to the players. I'm specifically thinking about Grey Ranks, which has the players playing child soldiers during the Polish uprising in 1944. It was a fascinating game to play, and because of the narrative aspect of the game, is able to handle what could be a really dark and depressing game really well. I'm sure there are a lot more examples of RPGs that cover sensitive topics.  ||||| Typically, I think it's going to depend far more on the type of event than the timing.  People were very concerned that [Freedom: The Underground Railroad]([URL] was going to be insensitive to the topic, and some people still refuse to play it, due to the subject matter.  Even though you're playing the good guys, the very fact that part of game play involves simulating the actions of the slavers is too much for some.

2735	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	15	I'm an 'amateur producer' and I'm looking to get some monitor speakers, the problem is the room that my computer is in; [seen here]([URL]   I was looking into the Yamaha HS8s they seem incredibly accurate and reliable for their price range, I make electronic music so being able to monitor the low end is really important to me. I'm not sure about the room size for the 8" monitors?  Would I be better of with 5-6" or am I wasting my effort with this room?   I'm really in the dark here but I really want a pair of monitor speakers to improve my music. I've been using exclusively ATM-M50 headphones and nothing I make sounds the same on other sources (cars speakers, earbuds, etc).  Also, what are my the best desk placement / audio treatment options in here? As it stands it's an empty room with a computer desk and chair, thin curtains on my window and old hardwood floors. There's not much reverb in here being a small room, but the odd shape (the closet) I'd assume there would be a lot of problems with bass?  ||||| I'd get some 5 inch monitors for that room size.  ||||| Yeah those yamahas are probably your best bet unless you can somehow find some equator d8/5s around. Anyway id recommend getting some kind of fiberglass panels (diy or not) at least to make your listening space more accurate. As far as placement goes your desk is in the right place, just make sure your speakers are at ear height when you're sitting down. Isolator pads under the monitors would help too and desk stands for the monitors are highly recommended. ||||| My room is slightly bigger than yours and I use the yamaha hs5 monitors with a hs8s sub. They are my first monitor set since using a recreational stereo with a sub to mix. My audio quality has improved a ton and the 5" monitors should be fine for your room. Make sure they are positioned in the "near field," look that up if you need. Also a little treatment goes a long way. I would also say set your room up so the sound signals aren't bouncing off parallel surfaces (set your desk up in a corner, feng shui) it works for me.  ||||| First, make sure that your desk is in the middle of the wall. This will increase accuracy once you get monitors. I would also consider putting your desk against the north wall in order to reduce back window reflections (both visual and audio reflections). I use the JBL LSR305s for my room with a subwoofer. You're going to need a subwoofer with 5 inch monitors. I'm not sure about 8 inch monitors, but if you're doing electronic music, I highly recommend a subwoofer in order to really "feel" your music. ||||| I have just traded in my equator d5s for d8s.

8971	1,3,3	4	The wind bit at my face. It was cold, like a thousand daggers. But the pain was nothing, I felt nothing, and I stood alone. It was quiet. I hated the quiet. It had once been all I wished for, all I dreamt about in those sleepless nights. But the moment they left, I realized I needed them back. I was nothing – a champion with nothing but a title. The voices… They were the champions. Without them I would have been nothing. But here I am, standing as nothing with a title to show for it.  All the pain – the misdirection, the confusion… the agony of their presence. And yet, they still promised me greatness. And greatness is what they gave me. I left as a simple boy, but what they gave me was more than anyone else was capable of. They gave me friends, they gave me achievements, they gave me direction. I felt like I was a part of something. And even the most impossible goals were within reach.  But I was deceived.  The moment I stood in my victory, every voice collectively celebrating their triumph, they left. And I knew right then and there that it was not my victory, but theirs. I was just a toy, a catalyst for their game. They chewed me up, and spat me out without a second thought. And my friends, who I had battled alongside with, overcoming even the greatest of hurdles, looked right through me. I wasn’t their friend. They were Gods, kings, creatures beyond power… And who was I to have such power in my grasp? They knew the answer just as well as I did… I was no one.  So here I stand alone, with Gods and kings at my side. The cold mountain wind chilled me to my core. But I could take it. I had to if I  was ever to be as strong as them.  Because now they were coming. The voices were returning, with yet another pawn in their game. They have come to topple me. I heard them, faint whispers on the wind, they drive him towards me. And I have to be strong now, stronger than I ever was with them. They thought they could just use me.  Well, they thought wrong.  ||||| I love this.

For a comparison, I have now a Dark Terror and it's much harder to deal with the volume knob, even at 7W it's harder to find a good low volume, and it sounds much worse than the Blackstar if not pushed (much richer when pushed tho). ||||| I love my Ibanez TSA15h, can be switched between 5w and 15w. ||||| I have a Fender Champ 600 for a small. I think I paid about 100 dollars for it a couple years ago new, looks like they don't make them any more but you could probably find one used for not a lot. I've had a Marshall 1974 JMP, a 2203 JMP and a 2204 JMP, DSL50, Vibrolux, Deluxe reverb, Dr. Z Maz, old Kalamazoo 12 amongst amps in the past 3 years and the one amp that I've had the whole time is that cheap 600, sounds really cool cranked, does ok as a bedroom amp with a pedal.  Whats wrong with your AC15 for a bedroom amp though? Doesn't it have a master volume? There really aren't any tube amps that sound 'tube' like at bedroom levels...they don't compress and get that punchy touch sensitive thing going until they have some volume going through them. Even those 1w amps they have out have to get pretty loud to start doing their thing. ||||| AC4 and Champ 600 are ideal for that.
9315	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3	11	I used to consider super low end wine like Franzia and Carlo Rossi to be plonk with the dominant characteristics being their low price and their relative inoffensiveness (or lack of personality).  However, more and more on this forum, I'm seeing people use that term to refer to mass marketed medium priced ($8-10) wines like Apothic Red, Yellow Tail, and Menage a Trois. Yes, these are some of the most popular wines in the US by sales volume and are sold in every grocery store and Target/Wal-mart, but is the sales channel and volume what defines plonk or are these genuinely bad wines that have been marketed well?   (For the record, I actually like the Menage a Trois Red Blend quite a bit and used to stock up when it first came out since I could only find it at Costco and a few other places. As for Apothic, it's got a bit too much residual sugar for me but it's not terrible and I get the appeal.) ||||| Plonk for me is any cheap and/or mass produced wines who's main virtue is lacking any personality. Basically wines made for a target demographic first with the grapes, origin and production methods selected as an afterthought.  If the brand is the only important part of the equation, it's plonk. (So by my criteria a Bordeaux first growth avoids the plonk label because the content of the bottle is as important or more so then the brand). ||||| do a tasting note - can you honestly get more than 2 aroma and flavor descriptors? ||||| My memory may be a bit hazy, but I remember Menage a Trois to be akin to sucking on a cherry candy of some sort - far, far, too much sugar and an oddly artificial tinge to the fruit.   My main complaint with wines like these (and yes, I consider them plonk) - they're essentially adult juiceboxes - sugary, fruit-forward messes with no balance or integration of flavors (and I use the plural here generously) whatsoever. They're the wine equivalent of a Michael Bay flick, and much like the same, they all tend to run together in my head - no real distinction between varietals/blends, or even brand-to-brand.   Not to mention you should be able to find some really good wine at the $10 mark.  ||||| All of the $8-10 bottles you mentioned would be perfectly at home in a 1 gallon jug, but their marketing convinces you otherwise.  That said, cheap, plonky wine has it's place. I'm typically not one to turn my nose up at it unless it's truly unpalatable. I don't buy it for myself, it tends to show up on its own.  Further, the quality of really cheap industrial wine is going up, at least in terms of inoffensiveness. The $3-5 bottles I've had in the last few years didn't tickle my brain like good wine does, but it also didn't trigger a gag reflex (for the most part), which is an improvement. ||||| My general definition of plonk is "anything lacking complexity".   I think mass-marketing dovetails with that in the general public prefers "big juice and big sugar" at the expense of nuance and balance.  If all the customer is after is an okay table wine or--even worse--something that will get them the most wasted for the money, why bother?   ||||| Good question. I think plonk can apply to any wine generally made with a limited flavor spectrum, little depth, usually obvious residuals, in whites having either high acid in place of minerality or very low acid & overripe fruit/oak, and in reds a kind of ur-sludgy fruit flavor instead of more defined actual flavors like black cherry or mushroom. Personally I can apply this description as much to Silver Oak Cab as to Apothic Red as I find them both to have a syrupy muddy mouthfeel, a sticky lingering aftertaste instead of a long finish.   What plonk does is guarantee consistency at the price of complexity and variation. So my definition of plonk, while it does generally encompass mass-market wine, can also include a $50 bottle that guarantees a certain flavor profile regardless of vintage.  ||||| For me, Apothic, Yellow Tail and Menage a Trois are plonk.

Our first exercise was the evocation of Michael, which I thought would be a cinch, after having naively dabbled in Enochian magic. It most certainly was not. In fact, it was the most intense meditation I had ever performed, and a little frightening too, as I was receiving images of a skull and felt a very sketchy, untrustworthy presence. Michael is certainly not a handsome, charming man with fluffy angel wings, that much I can definitely say.  It caught me off guard, and I was hesitant in returning after that, as the leader apparently didn't know what she was doing. The lodge died soon after that.

2916	1,3,3,3,3,2	9	Hi bike mechanics. I need advice on how to come about getting a piece of plastic for my grip shift.   The plastic piece that is broken is similar (the same but made of plastic by my inspection) to [this one]([URL] ^to ^bike ^mechanics ^over ^youtube ^too.   My question is: should I buy a whole new grip shifter? Is there a place where I can order just the plastic thingy (I imagine it might be more expensive than buying a used pair of grip shifters in my local market)?   Also, if I decide to buy a replacement shifter, can I pick any kind I want (I mean any kind that goes with MTB)?   If this is relevant, my bike is a 1999 trek.  ||||| The things you need to know to find a replacement shifter are how many gears you have at the back (on the cassette or freewheel), and possibly the brand of the rear derailleur if it's unusual.   You might want to debate whether you actually want a grip-shift, you might find the shifting action on some Shimano rapid-fire shifters to be better.   It would also be able to know the exact model of your current grip shift if you can find it written somewhere.  ||||| If I were in your shoes, I would just buy a [whole new shifter]([URL] as they are pretty cheap. In addition, most will come with a new cable, which is a nice bonus.  You should get one that matches the old one.  If your old one is a six speed, buy a new six speed shifter. ||||| $15 will get you a new shifter with a new cable and probably housing.   ||||| I would try to upgrade to trigger shifters if at all possible (assuming you want that).  It seems like a few people have good solutions for replacing what you have, but if you like trigger shifters, they'd be just as easy to replace (and they're a lot easier to fix to replace cables too and typically have more metal ratchet mechanisms) and aren't much more expensive.   ||||| [sugru?]([URL]

Okay, I actually REALLY like their cleansers but the whole really high pH thing... So I wanted to try the low pH blueberry cleanser but people are saying it's drying.

1606	1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,2,3	15	I decided to give this whole Beginner’s Guide thing a try, as I think there is a severe lack of them on this subreddit and the ones that have been posted are great ways to get into new music. Any band that I would know enough about to be able to write the guide from memory has already been covered, so I figured I would write a guide for the only notable thing to come out my hometown: Miss May I  The suggested songs are intended to be the most representative of the album they are on, but in some cases albums had popular songs that weren’t in line with the rest of the album.  **Apologies Are for the Weak (2009)**  As I mentioned, Miss May I is from my own hometown, a town of around 25000 people north of the Dayton area. Apologies was written was the band while still in high school, so some of the teachers there actually have Apologies Are for the Weak posters. One chemistry teacher was even invited to the vocalist, Levi’s, wedding. As for the music, Apologies was Miss May I’s heaviest release overall with a pretty low emphasis on clean vocals. This being said, there was still plenty of melody and this album is definitely worth listening to in its entirety.  Suggested Tracks: [Forgive and Forget]([URL] [Architect]([URL] [Tides]([URL] [Apologies  Are for the Weak]([URL]  **Monument (2010)**  Monument was Miss May I’s breakout album, and is largely considered their best work to date. This is with good reason, as Monument is the perfect mix of Miss May I’s heavier metal influence with plenty of metal and a more substantial use of clean vocals. The tracks listed below are three of the most popular, but the entirety of Monument is among Miss May I’s best offerings.  Suggested Tracks: [Our Kings]([URL] [Masses of a Dying Breed]([URL] [Relentless Chaos]([URL] [Monument]([URL] and the rest of the album.  **At Heart (2012)**  At Heart gave us what is arguably Miss May I’s biggest hit (Or at least one of their best songs live), Hey Mister. Overall, At Heart pleased the majority of their fans, but left some slightly disappointed at the decrease in melody and complexity when compared to Monument. At Heart is definitely an album that I would recommend, but it just isn’t quite as explosive as Monument was.  Suggested Tracks: [Hey Mister]([URL] [Day by Day]([URL] [Live this Life]([URL] [Ballad of a Broken Man]([URL]  **Rise of the Lion (2014)**  Rise of the Lion is the album that has the largest stigma surrounding it, particularly because it just wasn’t liked by many of Miss May I’s fans. This album’s lack of success is largely responsible for the gap of only one year between this release and Deathless. Rise of the Lion had numerous tracks that sounded both overproduced and low quality at the same time. I would recommend skipping over Rise of the Lion, as Miss May I’s next album is a complete 180.  Suggested Tracks: If you really must, listen to [Hero with no Name]([URL] or [Gone]([URL]  **Deathless (2015)**  Oh god, what a comeback. Deathless is the worthy successor to 2010’s Monument, and brings back Miss May I’s original sound. It’s a very heavy release, with plenty of melody and fantastic sounding vocals. This is overall just a very fun album to listen to, and I highly recommend listening to it in its entirety. Miss May I might be responsible for one of the biggest comebacks in this genre with Deathless more than eclipsing both Rise of the Lion and At Heart.  Suggested Tracks: [I.H.E.]([URL] [Trust My Heart (Never Hope to Die)]([URL] [Deathless]([URL] [Turn Back the Time]([URL]  Admittedly I haven’t listened to Miss May I as much as some of their other fans, as I wasn’t really into metalcore until the last couple of years, so this commentary may differ from what other fans think. However, for what it’s worth I think Miss May I has a terrific discography in spite of some of the lesser areas and I think it’s amazing they were able to put Troy, OH on the map.  Please feel free to leave corrections in the comments, I plan on updating this if necessary and keeping this a relevant beginner’s guide.  Thanks for reading!  Edit: Added Gone to suggested tracks as per comment suggestion. ||||| I would put Gone in with ROTL songs to listen to, but that's just me. But overall very good representation of the band.  ||||| Ballad of a broken man is their best fucking song IMO. ||||| I don't get the hate Rise of the Lion gets.

I truly think his voice grew into something great on Deathless and even hearing him live he is 10x better than when I first saw him.    I must admit though, Monument and Apologies For The Weak are my top 2 albums. 'Rust' and 'Colossal' are probably my most played songs off of Monument along with Masses Of A Dying Breed and Our Kings (tbh you can't go wrong with any of those songs like you said).  ||||| [empty] ||||| Monuments is their best, Deathless second.

6271	1,3,3	14	So Netflix has been trying to get me to watch HighSchool of the Dead for the longest time, and I had some time last weekend and actually just sat down and watched all 12 episodes in season one. I am not really into how fanservice-y it was, but I loved the gore, the realisticness of it, and also the idea of going all martial arts on zombie asses. (I am blackbelt but truth be told in a zombie apocalypse I wouldn't want to put my hands in biting range of them.)

Also does anyone know if the show will be getting a second season ever? And if so how long I have to wait for it to come to the states. Thanks.  ||||| 1. Don't read manga on aggregate sites.  2. The show will not be getting a second season anytime soon. As you have read, there isn't enough manga material to make a whole cour.  3. HOTD is on hiatus. Well, it came back from hiatus for 1 chapter and now it's back on hiatus. The [scanlator's update their sit]([URL] on it's status as each new monthly magazine comes out. ||||| I'm a big fan of the series, the new acts are on a monthly release i think but the next manga volume won't be for a while sadly 
8667	1,3,3,3	4	What are your guy's opinions on the increased amount of music being added to the show?    I personally quite like it. It tends to adds to the emotion of the moment.    Just wondering what y'all think. :) ||||| I like it.  Every song choice seems to carry a certain depth and they've all been obscure enough to not cheapen the whole thing.  I also found out about an amazing artist named Jamie N Commons through the show. He just featured on Eminem's latest album, oddly enough. ||||| I have loved almost every song they've used, which blows my mind. I hate everything, haha. The more music they use, the better. ||||| I love it. I would be worried that they will start to go to the well to often. But as of now, it ads a lot  
4026	1,3,3,3,3,3	11	Sorry this is super long! Just wanted to try to cover everything as it's such a big decision even though it will be a few years down the line when we have our own house.  **What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?**   * A companion for myself and my fiancé, playmate for our current dog, training partner (tricks, obedience, therapy work or anything the dog shows a natural instinct/enjoyment in like agility, scent work etc)  **What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?** Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?  * Me and my fiancé have joint experience taking care of and training a currently 2 year old (adopted around 8 months - 1 year old so no experience of puppy stage) female border collie to Canine Good Citizen Award silver level (UK), use luring and also clicker/marker training for shaping and capturing,  purely positive based training  **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?** If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?   * As above have a 2 year old female border collie who generally likes other dogs with a few exceptions. She is generally leash reactive ( we are working on this to make her more comfortable) but does well off lead and in houses with other dogs. She prefers slightly laid back personalities that are up for a few games of chase but can chill after a bit of play and not constantly bug her (we know if we get a puppy we will be careful to redirect the puppy if it annoys her). She generally doesn't like labs, huskies, german shepherds -  usually any big bouncy excitable dogs. We also have 3 degus which hopefully will still be with us when we are looking for our second dog. We will always have several small furries in our life as we love them but the dog doesn't necessarily need to get on well with them as our current dog fixates on them so we currently separate them anyway. We may in future get some chickens, ducks etc as we will be based in a rural setting.  **Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?**   * We are unsure if we will have children in future but if we do we would either wait until the child is slightly older or get the dog beforehand, train it well and prepare both of the dogs for the baby (desensitize to crying sounds, baby items, strong go to mat & leave it cues, walking with a stroller etc).  We don't have any children visiting our house but we would like to have the option to go to other people's houses who have children - but if we couldn't properly supervise the interactions we would leave them at home.  **Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?** What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?  * We currently rent but will only be looking for our second dog when we own a house. We are looking for a quiet rural house with a large enclosed garden and/or field space around it.  **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**   * I'm a bit all over the place with breeds as I'm the first to admit I like the aesthetics of certain dogs but definitely don't want to get a dog that isn't suited to our lifestyle.  Our border collie is probably on the chiller side and doesn't seem to require as much exercise as most. If we could find another similar border collie that would be a high choice for us (abundance of border collies in rescues around us). We are also interested in Rough Collies as we have only heard lovely things about their temperament although we haven't actually meet one in person and they regularly come up in rescues as well as having a few breeders nearby us, and seem a good fit for our lifestyle. We have also considered Poodles (any size) as they would seem a good fit for doing the training and exercise we would do. I would need to learn to use a shaver so we could keep it in all over close cut for handiness. Shetland sheepdogs appeal to me as well but unsure about their temperament as again haven't met any in person so would love to hear any opinions about them and would want to research it more. I also like cardigan corgi's too but a bit unsure because of potential structure issues. Like I said I like a few based mostly on appearance such as Samoyeds but think they might be too independent for my liking and Red Setters but unsure if it we could provide it enough exercise. I am open to other recommendations as well, although in general I don't like terriers, hounds and sighthounds due to prey issues, not great off leash etc but feel free to bash my stereotypes :)  **Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?** How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?  * Myself and my fiancé, both of us will be responsible. We are both on board with getting a second dog.  **How often do you have visitors to your home?**  * Not often we are fairly quiet people, maybe 2-3 times a month at maximum, usually around special occasions like birthdays and Christmas.  **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?**   * We adopted our current dog from a rehoming centre and as we were quite inexperienced we weren't too sure what we were getting into but as we know what to look out for now we would look to adopt from an rescue centre nearby which is based in a home environment, from a foster home or from a reputable breeder.  **Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?**   * We would either prefer a puppy or an older dog (3-4 years). I feel like we could do a great job socializing the puppy with different people, animals, sounds, environments etc. and making it a really bomb proof dog and it would be great to know its full past as that was something we really struggled with our current dog - we never knew if her fears were from abuse or just under socialization. Alternatively an older dog past its adolescence stage would be good as we would get to see its personality after maturity as that’s generally when issues like dog aggression etc start appearing.  **What size dog are you looking for?** [Here is a size chart for your convenience.]([URL]  * I would prefer something that I could pick up in case it's  injured a paw etc so nothing majorly big/heavy. Prefer small to medium, medium to large dogs. Don’t really like either end of the scale - great dane or chihuahua for example  **How much barking is too much barking?**   * I don't mind alert barking for the door-bell and letterbox or during play sessions but don't want them to bark for attention or every little noise outside.  **How much regular brushing are you willing to do?**  * Can brush as much as needed - probably most once a day, least 2-3 times a week  **How much shedding do you think you can handle?** Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead.  * Our current dog sheds a ton so not particularly bothered  **Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**   * I do all current grooming myself (trim foot pad hair and the "skirt", cut and file nails etc) so would have no issue with that. If required I could go to a groomers regularly but would prefer to learn to do it myself at home.  **How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?**   * Not a huge fan of slobber, don't really mind farts  **How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?**   * Eager to please as I would like to do a lot of bonding through training and play  **What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?**   * Basic and advanced obedience, good off leash, trick training, and anything else they show a natural aptitude to  **Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?**   * That's a difficult one, I'm not sure which behavior I wouldn’t be able to deal with until I had to deal with it I guess lol. We are pretty knowledgeable in dog training and behavior so we don't mind the dog having a few issues from its past but we don't necessarily want a "project" dog that requires a ton of specialized desensitization, socialization and training to be comfortable around people or dogs or severe resource guarding etc.  **How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?**   * I would say it's pretty important as my current dog is great off lead in wooded areas etc and would like for the second dog to enjoy the same freedom without worrying about it bolting or getting a scent and not coming back. We would put a lot of work into this with recall training, reinforcing check-ins and use long lines/flexi leads until we're confident but if the breed is naturally good at sticking close would be a bonus.  **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?**   * Would spend around 30 minutes in the morning either walking, playing chase/exploring in the garden (want to make a sensory garden when we buy our house), fun agility (we have jumps and weaves and want to add more obstacles like the tunnel, a-frame etc) or body awareness using paw-pods, balance boards etc.  On days we work from home we would do another 30 minutes at lunchtime of anything from the above. And after dinner time again would do 30-45 minutes of any of the above activities.  On weekend days we like to go on 1 hr off-lead walks around wooded areas as well as those activities around the house. Occasionally (once  or twice a month) we go to dog parks or the dog hydrotherapy pool for swimming.  **How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?**   * Would spend around 15 minutes in the morning  using their kibble to either trick/obedience train, desensitization work or use puzzle toys like the kong wobbler etc. Another 15 minutes at dinner time again doing the same. Several short play sessions throughout the day playing fetch, tug, flirt pole or whatever the dog enjoys. A frozen kong or raw bone a day and chews and toys always available. I also like to train on walks - waiting at kerbs, touch then go sniff, reinforcing check ins and loose lead etc. If the dog enjoys it we will also do weekly training classes which are a hour on Saturdays, and possibly agility classes weekly. We will also do regular training in new environments like settling in dog friendly cafes etc.  **Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?**   * Initially would be crated until we could trust it to free roam without getting into harm or destroying things and until the two dogs have settled together and can be trusted to be left alone together. Then it will have free roam of the house or have a dog proofed room/rooms. Will sleep in the bedroom with us on its own bed as our current dog does.  **How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?**   * We have recently changed jobs that allow working from home several days a week so ideally it will only be left alone on one work day a week but may be two or three work days a week at busier times but see below as it won't necessarily be left the full day.  **If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?**   * Yes we currently have a reputable dog walker come by several times a week around midday for our current dog so could do the same in future. She also does puppy visits so could use that service if we get a puppy.  **What is the general location in which you live?** You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume you’re somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).  * UK  **What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?** Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.  * 0-5 celsius in winter, 18-25 celsius in summer.  **On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?** What are your plans for your dog in case of a dramatic lifestyle change?  * 8-10 Having our current dog we are well aware of the commitment including the time, cost, effort and training required. We have purposefully changed jobs to ones that allow us to work from home more regularly so that we can spend more time with our dog. We always come home first after work and don't take part in after work activities unless one of us can stay home with our dog as it isn't fair otherwise. Any holidays we plan to go on will involve both dogs or they will stay in our trainer's home where they will be well looked after.  If our jobs change again to involve more office hours we can easily afford the cost of dog walkers etc. If we have children we will fully prepare the dogs and heavily supervise any interactions to ensure both the children's and dogs' safety.  **Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?**   * Fully aware of the costs, our current dog is totally spoilt with new accessories, toys, treats etc We could easily afford the extra food and pet insurance costs a month. We have a credit card for emergency situations but we will get lifetime pet insurance that covers up to £12,000 a year like our current dog so should be well covered.  ||||| Hello fellow person with chill 2yr old female Border!   We're thinking of a Papillon or a Poodle of undecided size for our next dog. I've got experience with the Poodle coat and some with the dogs themselves, and I've heard that Paps are just a mini version of a BC, so I'm currently sitting 50/50 on the choice.   If you're going rural with lots of land,go the larger dog just for its own safety, but as we'll be staying in suburbia, mini Poodle of a Pap is fine here.   Both breeds are super smart and willing to please and many have shown success in dog sports and obedience etc etc.   Don't let the coat of the Poodle turn you off them either. A quality set of electric clippers and a good pair of scissors will set you right. It's relatively fast yo learn yourself if you don't mind the dog looking stupid the first few times.  ||||| I haven't ever though of Papillons so definitely could research them more. I have only ever seen a few in real life and they seemed very much lap dogs in those cases instead of for tricks/agility etc.  I wouldn't be sure of size for poodles as our dog generally gets on better with dogs around her height so the smaller sizes may be better than a standard.  Yea I would quite like to do all the grooming at home and I don't mind if they look a bit silly the first few times as it was a learning curve for our current dog as well. The first few times I used normal scissors instead of the feathering scissors and she came out all blocky looking haha. ||||| According to my (very) limited experience, a Japanese Spitz would be exactly what you're looking for. Look 'em up :) ||||| If you can find a very reputable breeder, I personally love Cavaliers. We have them come into my job all the time, we've never had an ill-tempered one. Great attitude, very willing. Wants to be with you but will go do it's own thing. Can sometimes be a bit noisy, some like to talk, but I've only ever seen them when they aren't home and are quite excited. Only problem is they do tend to have health issues, particularly that some will have a brain too large for their skull and will cause immense pain.  Another breed is Australian Shepherd, I owned these since I was a child and I absolutely love them. Pretty similar to Borders but I think they tend to be a bit more low energy. Extremely smart and easy to train but a bit more hair care than a border. They do come in a mini and a toy size but I do not know about the healths of those two, I've own several standards and the only issue we really had was hip dysplapsia in one but we got from a good breeder.  Poodles are also VERY smart but you need to keep up with the hair and groom often. They tend to follow you around at home. Basically if you own a poodle you will probably turn around and see him there every time haha  We get a lot of poodles come in and they come in every size and there are plenty of rescues for these guys.  Chins and corgis are also fun but I don't know about their training but they are the cutest things! Goldens are also great dogs, lots of hair and not really an "outside of the box" thinker on average but easy to train and tend to have great attitudes  Sorry this is a bit of a lot haha I work at a groomer Also as a hound owner I am not at all offended by the hound comment ;) They are great as long as they don't see or smell anything and then they are just gone haha ||||| If you want a protection dog, I reccomend a Lab and Great Dane mix.  They are large, good with children if you introduce them to it while it's a puppy, smart and social.  They bark very loud and are friendly to people that are introduced to it.  I have one and he is awesome.  He plays with our puppy and protects us.  They bark VERY loud and can defend against an intruder.  They sadly don't live very long, around 8-10 years

8068	1,3,3,3,3,3	13	Sorry if this is a newb question! New subscriber here, just found out about this game yesterday and I havent stopped reading/researching yet :) I'm pretty much a newb when it comes to PC gaming, other than running Skyrim with a fair bit of mods for a while.  Mostly, I game with the wifey on PS4, we've been splitscreening on CoD for over 3 years now, and I finally got her to branch into something new (Diablo 3).  Knowing her love for FPS, and my love for all things interplanetary, I'm hoping to get her on board with Star Citizen. So my question is: will we need two PCs to be able to play this together? Or will something like a dual monitor setup be possible?   We do all our gaming in bed, if that matters. I can easily mount two drop-down monitors on the top of the cubby our bed sits in :) ||||| 2 high end PCs, is what you will need.  ||||| 2 high end PC's you will need  1 years worth of patients  As much time for fun as you can possibly get.

Try with PCI-E as priority and see if it'll boot to OS X.  The 760 is a Kepler card and so *shouldn't* require use of the web driver. Tonymac did, however, in one of his problem-solving guides, suggest that El Capitan may be requiring the web driver to make more of nVidia's GPUs functional (user annecdotes, so who knows).  If enabling/verifying *inject nVidia* doesn't work, try installing the web driver while running on the iGPU, then making the switch. ||||| well if you're not seeing the bios, it has to be hardware related. the OS wouldn't cause the bios to fail unless you used the os to upgrade the bios wrong.

Edit: Do you think the world today would be ready to have contact or see visual evidence of aliens? ||||| I'm not an idiot.  Thus, I don't believe in anything without sufficient evidence to prove it.  I find it *highly theoretically likely* that there are life-forms on other planets, but until we see real, physical signs of them, it's just as silly as believing in anything else without evidence... like unicorns, or god. ||||| I dont ||||| the same reason i don't believe in god. just because someone says its likely or whatever without any fucking proof whatsoever, does not equate to me believing in it. ||||| Oh but I do.

6815	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	31	I have rooted and unlocked my phone and tablet.  From there both have the ROM of my choice, loaded mods, paired up with a sixaxis controller, loaded up emulators and controller friendly Android games, and voila... I connect with an MHL and I am up on the big screen.   I have zero experience with these "Android on a stick" devices, but they look slick and some people who have them swear by them.  I am really tempted to buy one for $60!  Wonder how customizable they are... I am sure it varies from device to device.  The one I used in the example I chose because it DOES have Bluetooth (many earlier ones apparently do not), but the review also mentions that these may not be as "hack-able" as other models.  (e.g. the MK802)  Obviously there is a quad core in the OUYA and only a dual core in the sticks, but there is a pretty big price gap also.  I cannot help but think that someone is going to put a Tegra 3 into one of these sticks soon, throw in a Bluetooth PS3-style controller, and offer it up for under $100.  That being said, what would differentiate the OUYA from this setup I describe?  Is OUYA actually going to port games over to use a controller?   If not, how will they overcome this "designed for touchscreen" issue I run into with most games?  Specs for both device- UG007 Specs: Solution  1.6 GHz Rochip RK 3066, CORTEX-A9 OS   Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean Display  HDMI OUTPUT(TV) RAM   1GB DDR3 Flash   8GB Nand Flash WIFI   802.11B/G/N Bluetooth  Ouya Specs: System-on-chip used Nvidia Tegra 3 (T33) SoC[1][2] CPU           Quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 Storage capacity         8 GB internal flash memory Memory   1 GB RAM Display   HDMI 1080p, 1080i, 720p Graphics          Nvidia ULP GeForce GPU Input           USB 2.0 (one) Controller input         Wireless controller Connectivity  Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth LE 4.0 Ethernet port ||||| Ouya isn't just Android. It's the store, the community, the controller and the part they build on top of Android too. There's added value in a store with guaranteed controller compatibility. ||||| So a little bit regarding specs, the UG007 has a dual-core processor, whereas the OUYA sports a Tegra 3 quad-core. So right off the bat, the OUYA's CPU speed is roughly 2x faster. Also the Tegra 3 chip also has a far more superior GPU built in that will absolutely crush the RK 3066 in every way.   OUYA was built around a strong CPU/GPU combo so it could play games. The UH007 was built for streaming media, so you probably won't get the best gaming experience out of it.  Hope that helps your decision! ||||| All games in the Ouya store are compatible with the controller out of box. ||||| The Ouya will run on Android, but it's gamestore will be separate. The games you will find on the Ouya will be real games, sure there might be angry birds but everything is going to be built with a controller and the Ouya in mind. ||||| The other thing a lot of people forget is that our a is not Meant to be a system for ports. It's not even meant to be thought of as android. Think of the android part only in this light: android developers will find it easy to make games for ouya, and it could be easy for them to port their already made android games. But other gran that, forget that you even heard the word android. This is not the android store any more than the Amazon store is.  ||||| Funny enough, I learned about these sticks just today and asked myself the same thing. My answer is, these sticks are made to be primarily media centers while Ouya is primarily being built as a console. Not the best answer out there I know. ||||| Look perhaps towards the newly announced Steam-Box (or what ever it gets called).  Games can be pointed to the box as a reference, and porting them to edge devices is trivial (In this case, Steam-Box games will work on PC).  Ouya is just a pre-packaged device than Mom and Dad can buy Jimmy for Christmas '13 they don't have to worry about specifications, connecting 3rd party controllers, etc.

938	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	15	I was told by my pre health advisors that a 3.2sGPA will suffice to be viable for dental school. Is this true?  My sGPA is about a ~3.1-3.2 2nd year undergrad . I have a good amount of volunteer hours and currently no shadowing. I plan to volunteer and shadow heavily this summer.  My father is a dental technician so I was exposed to dentistry for basically my whole life. im familiar with ceramic restoration, implants, porcelain, crown & bridges, etc. and know the basic processes for most of the tech work.  How do dental school see exposure to dental tech stuff? I'm going to be more involved as my father is opening his own dental lab soon and he'll need much help from me (e.g. marketing).  I plan to take the DAT sometime this year, most likely end of summer. Is this too early?  Thank you for reading this  ___________________________________________________________  Also forgot to ask... Would it be a good idea to take some mathematics courses to higher GPA? I'm talking like Calculus 3, Differential Equations or Linear Algebra here and not something on the lower end like college algebra or pre calculus ||||| If the DAT goes well you should be able to get in with that GPA. The extra exposure to dentistry will look good, show them that you know what you're getting into, but it won't make up for a poor DAT or GPA.  I took my DAT after my sophomore year too. I don't see any problem with that so long as you've taken bio, gchem and ochem. There's a decent amount of physio in the bio section that I had to study extra for though because I hadn't taken physio yet.   While a 3.2 will likely get you in, I would really focus on trying to get that up to 3.4 in the next year. You don't want to have months of anxiety your senior year hoping you'll get in, and it's always nice to have more choices on where you attend.   ||||| Its viable in the sense thst people with a 3.2 do get in but that is definitely on the lower end of the spectrum. Also realize the people that got in with a low gpa are not weak applicants, they make up for it with a high dat score or did a masters, etc.  ||||| Your exposure to your Dad's work is good and it will help you in dentistry but it isn't as important as GPA, DAT score, and personality.  A lot depends on your residency, personal/financial history, and race.   ||||| As others have said, a 3.2 is good enough to get in but won't help you get in and will mostly likely hurt a little as the average is around 3.5-3.6.  If those math classes will boost your GPA then go for it.  What year are you and when do you plan to apply.  I assume next cycle?  If so, then taking the DAT this early is great if you can do well.    I would say see if you can actually help your dad as a tech assistant instead of marketing type stuff.  That would be better than general exposure.    Overall, get a 20+ on the DAT and you've got a good shot. ||||| Next cycle would mean June of 2016.  If that is the case then you are in great shape for your DAT by taking it this summer.  You will be able to submit all information as soon as the application opens in 2016 (submitting ASAP is helpful, try to do it as soon as it opens).  Also, by that point you will have another year under your belt for your GPA, try and show an upward trend.  Not only will your GPA increase, including your sGPA and bcpGPA since you'll be in more major classes, but it shows growing maturity, etc.  Again, all that said, just do well on your DAT and you're in good shape. ||||| if it's only your second year, you have a time to raise your sgpa. It would only be a good thing to take those math classes if either A they pertain to your major or B you're confident you can get As in all of them. No point in taking the risk to to end up with a B. It would be better if you took more science classes over those math classes especially biochem and anatomy because those would help for the DAT and are classes dental schools are looking for. I personally was a math and bio major and took all those advanced math classes and I honestly think I would have been better off sticking with just a bio major. As for all the dental exposure, it's nice and something good to mention in your personal statement and to talk about on interviews. You should definitely do the volunteer but focus more on improving your gpa and practicing for the DAT since those 2 factors carry the most weight. ||||| First year at a PA dental school here! Took the DAT after my junior year. My impression is that PA schools don't reserve as many of their seats for in-state students as other schools do- for example, WVU interviews/accepts almost no students from other states. My own class is roughly 50% in-state. Having applied to PA schools and having a general knowledge of what my classmates GPAs were like, I would say that applying with a 3.2 in PA is a bit of a longshot, but that you've got a lot of time for improvement- crush junior year. Agree with what others have said- an "upward trend" would look great on your transcript as far as GPA goes. DAT shouldn't be too crazy as long as you're solid in the basic sciences. My opinion is that Math, Reading, and PAT don't require any particular classes to do well on. The math I saw was mostly simple math applied using complex logic- permutations and probabilities and such. PAT, in my opinion, is a really cool topic because you can practice like crazy and add a big number to your DAT sheet. It really is something you can become very good at- and it'll help you to stand out.   Apologies if I went off topic, hope something I said was helpful!

5326	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	I once again saw Gretzky's career number when they were being compared to Jagr's and I was blown away. I started watching hockey at 11 in 2006 (post lock-out) so although I caught a few games of Super Mario (obviously past his prime) I never got to see the great one play.   I have so many questions. What made him so statistically dominant for his time? Was he head and shoulders better than all of his peers? Would he be the best player in the NHL today? Or was he more a product of the era he played in.   Also for fans who were around to see him, is there a quintessential Gretzky game to look up on NHL centre ice's archives? I'd love to hear a few stories. ||||| He was the smartest, so the puck always "found" him, no matter what. As an example, you see his goal that broke Howe's record for career points. He was behind the net, where he always went, and then he said for some reason he just went out front, which he rarely did, and the puck came right to him for a goal.   His passing was insane, he would pass it right through 2-3 people, and it always made it through, and right on the guy's stick. Even at the end of his career he made marginal players good. I think at the end with NY he could have lead the league in scoring if he played with even one good offensive winger.   I think he would still be good today, if you assume he would be into the weight/fitness regimes modern players are into, and of course he would have modern gear. I base this on being only a step lower than players like Jagr, who were young when he was at the end, and then played until near-modern times as good players.   Also, he always rose to the occasion. Example; he had 45 goals, and was near the record for fastest player to 50 goals in a season, and he went out and got 5 goals in his 39th game.  ||||| Two things. First, I'm almost 50, which sucks, but the one good thing about being my age is that I got to watch Gretzky for his whole career.  And secondly, you know when you watch a hockey game and every few games somebody does something that makes you gasp or laugh out loud? Patrick Kane or Stamkos or Ovi or whoever? Gretzky did that almost every game. He was the most mind-boggling hockey player I've ever seen. He did things that shouldn't have been possible. ||||| [deleted] ||||| Above average shot, skating and stickhandling, elite passing, and godlike hockey sense/vision (for that time). Below average physical shape and defense. That's my assessment of The Great One. His dominance was really more about how he played the game compared to everyone else at that time. Hockey of that era was all about moving the puck North/South, dump and chase, and shooting from anywhere. He pretty much did the opposite of that. Hed come in the zone, not dump it(!), stop just inside the blue line, skate across and do all this shit that you weren't taught how to defend. All of a sudden youre out of position and if he didn't burn you for a goal, he'd dish the puck to the wide open guy you completely forgot about who had a tap-in goal.  ||||| He was just ahead of his time. It's hard to explain other than that. He had an Accurate shot and hockey sense. Did he have a hard shot? No. But his shot accuracy exploited goalies like it hadn't been done before. Was he a strong, fast skater? No. But he knew when to come around and get on the offensive to create offence and odd man rushes.  ||||| With Gretzky he just had such a high level of talent in every category and was smarter than everyone he played against. I mean just looking at his stats. To put up  over a point a game in your last year in the league is just unheard of.   What made him amazing to watch was how effortless it all looked. No wasted energy or wasted movement. Never exerting himself more than necessary. He literally was given space by players out of respect, can you imagine that? A player who would get a warning before someone checked him?   It's unfortunate that there are those who will never be able to see him play because good as mcdavid might be, as good as Crosby is and as good as he makes players around him. As pure a shot as ovi, stamkos have and as much skating ability as any player has they won't have the package Gretzky did.  ||||| There is a lot of statistical work that goes into era-adjustment these days.  [For example]([URL] this list shows the leading scorer every year from 1917.  You will note that Gretzky's dominance is at least partially because he was able to play more seasons for more or less the full season much more often than guys like Orr or Lemieux, both of whom strong arguments can be made for best player ever.  For example, Orr scored 154 era-adjusted points in '70-'71, only 13 era-adjusted points less than Gretzky's best of 167 in '85-'86 *as a defenseman*.  Lemieux scored 129 era-adjusted points in '92-'93, but only played 59 games.  That's a 179 point pace for 82 games.  I still rank Gretzky as the greatest offensive player, but the raw statistics only show an overly flattering part of the story. ||||| ITT: skeptics and cynics who forget that "the modern era" is two generations of players and coaches studying and building off the ways that Gretzky thought and played the game.  ||||| Also I am really sorry for butchering the title. Grammar is important. ||||| He was undersized, he wasn't particularly fast, he didn't have the hardest shot.  I think that even today most of us don't quite understand exactly how he did what he did.    As others here have said, he had the best "hockey sense" of anyone, even by today's standards.  He always seemed to be in the right place at the right time.    Of course this was way before the days of Corsi & all the other methods we have to quantify players today, but even people who knew absolutely nothing about hockey could tell you that he was the best player on the ice.  I don't think you could say the same about the stars of today.  If you took somebody who had never seen hockey before to a game featuring Crosby or Stamkos or Ovechkin or whomever, I don't think they would stand out like Gretzky did.  There are two reasons for that.  First, the level of competition now is much higher, so the stars don't shine as bright.  Even if Gretzky himself was in his prime in 2015 it wouldn't be the same.  Second, none of today's stars have Gretzky's talent.  He was just on another level.  Of course, in terms of his raw point totals there are some reasons why his are way way higher than anybody else.  He played during a time when defensive systems were very primitive.  Goalie equipment was tiny compared to today.  The Oilers of the 1980's were probably the greatest dynasty ever - Gretzky himself, Kurri, Messier, Anderson, Coffee, Fuhr, on and on and on.  They were like an all star team who just happened to have their home rink in Edmonton.  I lived in Edmonton in the 1980's and I had the privilege of watching him at Northlands Coliseum many times.   Now that we're 15+ years past the end of his career I really appreciate how blessed I was to be able to watch him play live.   ||||| He had so many assists that even if he had never scored a single goal (of which he has the most all-time) he would still be the highest scoring player in NHL history. ||||| As I've heard he had the most points in every international tournament he was in, which says a heck of a lot I think. ||||| as a little boy watching games on TV or in person, he would have a diagram of the ice and just draw along with a pencil as the puck moved across the ice, so it wound up looking like a continuous scribble. he did that game after game. each time learning where the pucks went most frequently. he learned where to go, where the puck was going to go, how to get there before anyone else.  as a little kid when most kids his age were still learning to skate.  his talent was immense. his hockey intelligence was off the charts ||||| To describe his dominance: Wayne was not allowed to be drafted into most pools. Instead, he was usually split up into his Goals and Assists, you could only get one, someone else got the other.  To explain it: the Oilers struck draft gold in 1979. Grant Fuhr always came up with a big save, even if the final score was 6-5. The rest of the league caught on to what the oilers were doing with speed down the middle and tried to emulate it and out-Oilers the Oilers. They failed. In any other era, Calgary is a dominant team. In the 80s? They needed to catch a break to escape the division final.  I don't think Wayne would have been as statistically dominant now, but he would nonetheless be the best offensive player in the NHL. The reason why teams allowed Gretzky to operate in "his office" from behind the net was because he was at least being somewhat contained. Wayne would still be a 130-150 point guy today IMO.

7483	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3	38	So I recently met a really amazing girl, we hit it off really quickly, and she's one of the few people I enjoy hanging out with (a consequence of where I'm living these days, people who are like me are something of a rarity) and we've been on a handful of dates, but it hasn't been declared anything yet.     Only problem is that I'm not physically attracted to her (she's quite a bit heavier than the normal attractor of my attention). We haven't slept together, but when we fooled around I kind of realized that sex was going to involve me not being turned on by what I was seeing/touching/doing.     So I guess that this is almost more of an as_reddit, but how much have you compromised on physical appearances? It's a shame, because I really like the girl and would date the hell out of her if I didn't have this hanging over me. I don't want to sound like some kind of jock asshole, but I work hard to look good naked, am I a horrible person for wanting the same from my partner? ||||| Sex is a part of a good relationship; if you cannot imagine being attracted to her then this is not a good sign.  It's not a matter of being an asshole, so long as you break it to her gently and probably without mentioning why... ||||| Personally?  I don't know.  My physical tastes always swing to align with my emotions.  I definitely have a "type" though, and women not of that type generally don't attract my attention enough for me to even get to the "fooling around" stage.  But I do have a friend who is now with someone who was not his type.  He can definitely get off, and she's a ton of fun, but I don't know if he would look at her twin and call her "hot."  That is, apparently, not that important to him.  So I guess that the important thing to remember is that "attractiveness" is not objective.  Not only that, but it can be trained (as yours has probably been by the media).  Is this girl actually obese to the level of personal health risks, or just more curvy than most?  Would she be attractive at a different age in history?  If so, then you may realign as the relationship progresses.  It probably also depends a lot on how she treats sex, and how she acts during those times.  Generally the relationship will end if you can't get over that, and it's going to take as much work on your end (resisting porn, for one) as it would on hers to slim down as much as you would like.  I would be wary of expecting her to do that work if you were not willing yourself to retrain your sense of attractiveness. ||||| So you get along really well, and you love hanging out together, but you have no desire to tear off her clothes and hump her all night? Sounds like you've got a really great friend. Stop fooling around before you fuck it up. ||||| I think it's important to note that people change over time. They get old. They get wrinkly. They sag. They lose their hair. And yes, they tend to pack on some weight too.   The problem is when something's just "off" about the person - call it chemistry, if you will. There is science backing it up, but I'm not a scientist so I won't explain it well. For example:  - your partner smells funny to you... our scent tells us whether or not we are a good genetic match with someone  - you lack limbic resonance with the person (google it)...   I would friendzone someone who falls into this category for me, but not someone who simply doesn't fit into a standard definition of beauty, since beauty fades. I have dated and loved men of all types, including many that were objectively unattractive. But we just had that indescribable "chemistry" ... so subjectively, I did find them quite attractive.  ||||| If you don't find her attractive, I wouldn't continue pursuing anything. I know that sounds mean, but sex is a really important part of a relationship. (especially a new relationship) I think being turned on by your partner is essential. If you feel like you're just going through the motions with her, and didn't enjoy getting physical with her, I think you'll ultimately go looking for someone else. Prolonging the situation, maybe hoping things will change, will end up hurting her more in the long run.    I don't think you're coming off as an asshole at all. You take care of yourself, and you're entitled to want someone who does the same. From your post, I think you seem pretty polite.    ||||| See, in my experience, sexual chemistry has little to do with who I find attractive. Finding someone attractive helps, but it isn't the only indicator. Since you guys have made out, and you have identified no sexual chemistry is present, trying to date her with that being absent would be cruel and stupid. ||||| I have compromised on looks more often than not because we clicked so well in other areas. However, it doesn't work. I always ended up feeling sexually unfulfilled because the attraction wasn't there. If it is a weight issue only, remember that weight can disappear. She just has to be willing to work on it. I would suss out her feelings about exercise before pulling the plug on the relationship. Try to get her to workout with you.     Ugh, I feel you so much on this situation. Good luck. ||||| None, but then again I find all sorts of women attractive. I've dated tall, short, thin, fat, beautiful, and the not so beautiful. Personality, is a much bigger aspect of how attracted I feel towards someone than their appearance.  ||||| 20 lbs overweight but a cute face and nice rack and she seemed cool at the time.    Got fatter and bitchier, and I got over that quick. ||||| I always went for slim women.  I dated a few white women over the years, but most of my sexual partners were Korean.  I've never been with a fat woman.  The idea disgusts me. ||||| Physical appearance has never been much of a factor for me but I have a low libido.  So there's my two cents, but I don't think it's much help. ||||| It's not gonna work long term if you dont like what you're seeing, touching, or doing.  I've tried this before, and I've had sex with girls from 100lbs to 250lbs, and I definitely felt I needed to have a happy medium, and have a great physical attraction to that person in order for things to work. ||||| Not at all. ||||| I once accidentally had sex with a woman with more junk in the trunk than I could deal with.  We had a great conversational rapport, similar interests (binge drinking), etc., but I just couldn't stand to see her enormous ass.  It was extremely difficult to extricate myself from that since our personalities were so obviously well-suited.  I just kept vaguely saying "I just don't think we're a good match", which was obvious-to-both-of-us-ly untrue modulo the weight issue, lacking the balls/cruelty to say she was too big. ||||| You can't fuck personality. ||||| "You don't fuck their personalities."  To have a meaningful relationship (at least in my experience) you have to have a strong physical and emotional attraction.  I would definitely have no problem hooking up with a girl who's a stunner but a complete dolt intellectually, but she wouldn't be someone I would pursue a relationship with.   ||||| Also, do you really want to be with someone who doesn't take care of their body in that way? ||||| I agree with fidesratioque, working out together might be a good idea if weight is an issue and that attraction can grow as the relationship grows. If she's intimidated by workouts, suggest starting with a walk every other day or so and progress from there when she's ready. However, if you don't become physically attracted to her in the near future, maybe you should rethink the relationship. It's not fair to her to be with someone who doesn't want to touch her or see her naked and it's not fair to you to settle for someone you're not completely attracted to.        *However*, again, attraction can grow. Give it some time to see if your views of her body change or if you can get her to work out with you.

8062	1,3,2,3,2,3	10	Saitek drivers are bad. Really bad. I had more trouble installing my x52 Pro than I have had installing any kind of hardware since about 1995.   One of the problems with the x52 drivers (or perhaps the hardware itself, I don't know) is that it [doesn't play nicely with xHCI]([URL] and this information is not well documented.  This means that if you have a modern system with USB2 and/or USB3 your motherboard probably supports xHCI and therefore ~~will~~ might cause all sorts of problems when installing an x52. Your symptoms might be things like:  * Windows crashing *  x52 driver installer locking up * your x52 LED indicators not lighting up properly * Windows not shutting down * Windows not booting up * Disrupted internet access (yes, really) * Feelings of intense anger and hatred  If you experience these problems 1) [completely uninstall Saitek software]([URL] 2) go into BIOS and disable xHCI; 3) reboot windows and install the latest Saitek drivers.   Unless you run into any of the other typical problems seen by x52 users, this might solve your problems and save you some of the pains I experienced.  (For the record I run a Windows 7 64 bit machine, I'm not sure how these xHCI problems carry over to other systems or hardware configs)  ||||| /me pets Thrustmaster Warthog.  Thanks for posting this out there.  I noticed USB 3.0 with the x52 pro (which I received as an xmas gift) caused nothing but trouble.  I had REALLY obscure things happen.. Chrome wouldn't close, couldn't kill the process by PID even.  I literally HAD to reboot.  Doing this might have resolved my issue, however I wonder if it also would have resolved my x52 pro issue with the fact in things like BF4 where every map I would lose all my settings..    I'm not sure..  My feeling is there is no perfect joystick right now.. sans maybe modding the Warthog to require a little less friction to actuate.  That's one nice thing about the x52 pro, it actuates very lightly.. but it has a nice little deadzone that sucks and some slop to it.    I might keep it anyway due to really liking the throttle.. or I might take it back and get the x55 instead with the cash.

I had issues with the joystick ever since I changed motherboards, I tried all the ports and found that only the front ones were working properly with the unit. That's when I did some research and found the USB 3.0 problem. So I went and got those items :  * USB 2.0 PCI Card - 4 Ports + 1 internal (15$) * PS2 Cord (5$) * USB Extension Cord (5$)  I installed the USB Card in my tower, replaced the PS2 cable linking the stick to the throttle to get some more length and flexibility and the same for the USB cable... I uninstalled the drivers and the software, unplugged the USB cable launched the driver install software, plugged in the cable when prompted to and then rebooted.  The only issue left is with the display on the throttle unit, but unfortunately we can't do much about it unless someone wants to write an up-to date driver for Windows 7.  All I need to do now is spend 2-3 hours assigning keys to the joystick :P

7474	1,3,3,3,3	7	I broke up with my ex at the end of last year and started dating my gf in  March. It wasn't a sour breakup so we have kept in touch through Facebook messages. We chat about regular stuff that's going on in our lives (she also has a new bf) but about 3 months ago I messaged my ex and said that I missed her (when I'd been drinking).  My gf ended up reading my messages and is not happy with how much I chat to my ex. After seeing the "I miss you" message we had a big fight and it has ended up with me spending Xmas at my parents' house while she is away on a trip with friends that we were both meant to go on. She has told me that she doesn't know whether she can trust me any more and she feels like I have been emotionally cheating on her. I do still "care" about my ex but I don't have any feelings for her now.

2381	1,3,3,3,3,3	6	Hey ATP, first post of a long time lurker. So last night I was playing a PvP vs what I think was a DT rush.  I was going for [this]([URL] build, where the only scout after the probe scout comes with the Hallucinated Phoenix at ~6:00 (unless I missed something in the build)  When the Phoenix finally arrive, I saw the DT expand and plopped down a robo immediatly, but by the time it was done and I started chronoing the Observer, he had 4 of them and sniped my robo.  Was this just a build order loss?  Or is there a time other than the Hallucination that I should be scouting.  [Replay]([URL]  Thanks,  -Rip ||||| Puck does a similar 3 gate blink build. When he scouts DT tech, he blocks the ramp with his two stalkers and also warps in 2 or 3 more sentries to buy time for the Robo to finish.  ||||| When you scout it...  1. build Robo 2. move units back u wont have detection in 2 places at first 3. check base for pylons should be done long before, if you forgot do it after the scout. 4. Check for other proxyplyon postions. 5. Maybe get another sentry.  you could also get a forge and 2 cannons at the front and you would be safe until Warp Prism. Or you FF your ramp until yourobserver finishes. Could expand until you have enugh observers/cannons and then follow it up with 2 base Blink (7gates).  Even attack as fast as possible would have helped since he only had the MSC and you maybe get him to waste warp ins or warp in the first Dt's defensive.  This was no build order loss just not the correct reaction. ||||| Pretty much as radiokopf pointed out. The main reason you lost the game was letting the proxy pylon in your base. However even in that case there is a few things you can consider changing:  * Tighten up/improving the build: Dear chronoboosts his sentry whenever he crossspawns. While not the case here, nimbus is a big map and you might consider it anyway. Executing the build absolutely perfectly would have given you 15 seconds more time, exactly enough time such that the obs would have popped out. Chronoboosting the sentry would give you 10 seconds more.  * When you see his dts, you can protect the robo with a few tricks: You can simcity such that dts have little surface area to attack it. This isn't normally very effective, since they deal tons of damage anyway, but combined with having units (anything from fighting units to probes) hugging the robo, it can give you those precious seconds to get an obs out. Also normally a player won't commit to 4 dts in your base, but in this game it was a gamble that paid off for him. ||||| When you scouted the Dark shrine you should have immediately moved your stalkers so that they blocked the ramp to your main. This combined with a force field should buy enough time for you to get an observer out.   Also hello my FlareG brother ;) ||||| Block the ramp with units...also you can block it with pylons (you'll need 3) or even gateways.

2626	1,3,3,3	13	We met once, we're both a bit shy but have been texting and e-mailing since then. That was a bit more than a week ago. She's working an insane amount at the moment and I wanted to take her mind off things by having a relaxed evening where we cook and watch a movie.  She was about to say yes, and now (a few minutes ago) she was put on call for emergencies too... For this whole week... So now she's completely screwed and will be working pretty much 24hrs a day :(  How do I entertain her or make things easier for her? I was thinking along the lines of having some fun or useful item sent to her every day. I figure something tangilbe would be a lot more personal than just the usual chatter...  Let's make this a collection since others might find this useful too. She's a bit of a techie, good with photography and quite the petrolhead.  I could show up personally and bring her some of that stuff but I'm afraid that would rate rather high on the creeper-scale and I don't want to expose her in any way since we'll probably be seen by coworkers.

1454	1,3,3,2,3	13	So clipping.  You can either have non intersecting parts, aka real world, or you can turn that off and put stuff inside each other for more interesting designs.  I have a third option I would like to float.  "Not-cheating" clipping.  Basically, you can clip like you normally would, however the fuel and mass of the intersection of fuel tank wouldn't stack.  So you can submerge a fuel tank into another fuel tank halfway, but half of the fuel and mass of that part would disappear, becoming a half sized tank.  Since most parts of cylindrical it shouldnt be too hard to implement, and would allow for more creative but still realistic rocket design. ||||| I'd prefer procedural parts and Spore like ingame 3d editor :) ||||| They've already rejected this as too computationally intensive while not offering significant benefits.  ||||| Serious question, who cares and why does this bother you?

4177	1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	31	I quit smoking analogs 11 months ago.  I had no idea where to begin with the ecigs so I started out with an Ego 510 that cost me WAY too much and, needless to say, didn't last long.  I've been struggling through the mud since relying on youtube videos and other internet sources for information (no one I know vapes).  Then I found you!  Reading here I have learned more in just the last few weeks than all the months prior.  Just wanted to say you're the shit and thank you for all of the informative posts, opinions, and gentle hand to those of us not-in-the-know. BTW what do you think of the Kanger Evod?  How easy is it to clean?  How's the vape?  Any idiosyncrasies peculiar to this unit I should be aware of?  I'm not a fiddler.  I'm not into rebuilding.  I want to get in and go, y'know?  I have Ego twist 650 and 1100 Mah batts to pair with it. ||||| EVOD is excellent for a no hassle vape.  Heads are easy to replace and cheap.  Good strong vape, maybe a little airy.  If its to airy for you, cover up one of the 3 airholes.  Its a bottom coil, so the wicks stay wet.  Easy to fill.  If you find yourself running out of juice often, get the Kanger Pro-tank.  Basically the same thing.   ||||| I am a big fan of the EVOD. I have tried a lot of different clearos, from the CE4 to the Mini Vivi, even the T3 and MT3, which are basically the same thing.  I find the EVOD easy to use, long-lasting, and easy to clean, with no burns or dry hits. The only downside might be that it is small, but I dont mind that part. ||||| I have to agree with you on this community being so great.  I found it almost a month ago and it's really nice to have some place to go where you can get input on different items, help with trouble-shooting, and just enjoy all things vape related.   ||||| I don't like the Evod.  I have two and they both leak.  Vivi Novas have been working perfectly for me.    This is just my experience, I've seen others reporting the exact opposite of what I just said.  ||||| I've not used the Evod, but I've got a Protank and a few MT3's.  I've found that 50/50 PG/VG juices work well without tinkering on most of the Kanger stuff I've used. ||||| The sweet thing about Evods and the protank is that the evod heads can and will work for the protank, giving you that tighter draw. I still prefer my protank because of the glass.  Another cool thing is that you can rebuild the atomizers as well, so if you're starting rba or want to get into it you can mess around with those heads and get a bit more life outta them. ||||| I've never used to Evod but it looks similar to the t3 which i love. Gives good taste, good vapor, and never any dry hits. Someone else can comment on the difference between the t3 and evod.   The biggest advantage this has over say a vivi nova (with three parts and long whicks), is the two part bottom coil setup. I can easily change the atomizer without wasting all the juice.   If it floods, i can unscrew the atty and blow through the mouthpiece and the atty.   The whick is also short and saturates fast and doesnt leave a mess when i unscrew it. And since the whick is on the bottom, gravity keeps the juice on it no matter how full the tank is.  ||||| For my money, the EVOD is the best clearo out there. To clean, flush it with hot water (I use a blunt nose needle tip bottle). Replacement atomizers are $1.50, or they can be rebuilt pretty easily. I get a great draw and tons of vapor. Similar to the Protank, and the EVOD heads can be used on the Protank. I rotate between those two depending on where I am, with an occasional iClear 16 thrown in for good measure. ||||| I just picked up like 6 of these. They've become my new favorite clearo. I like them better than the kanger pro tank because it doesn't hurt as much if I accidentally hit my teeth ||||| Love the evod.  ||||| Anyone know where I can get EVODs the cheapest? I'm looking to compare some against my vivi novas ||||| I've been using Vivi Nova's exclusively for about 8 months.. before it was cartos but I wasn't a fan of them.. tired of them being bad from PKG, or me burning the becuase I didn't fill them enough (VWI was the reason usually)   I've had an evod for a few days and I'm pretty much sold on it it and want to pick up more depending on my continued experience.  Flavor is AWESOME compared to my nova.. when ordering ECB stuff I always ordered extra flavor.. I may go back to standard if I keep using the evod.. it really has great flavor.  Vapor is AWESOME compared to my nova.  I get clouds without trying..   Draw: It's easier to bring air through than a nova but I"m over it.. it doesn't make a differenct to me.   Downsides: Filling is a bit messy, when you twist off the bottom to refill you get a bit of juice down the center, maybe hanging upsidedown for a bit may save this.. I havent.  Leak/gurgle. I sometimes get a spot of juice on my contact, and it gurgles just a touch.  I'm on my first head so I'm hoping that it'll get better when I put a new head and make sure it's tight.  From what I understand BCC's are a little more succeptable to a little gurgle or incontinance from time to time.  (Anyone have good tips to stop this)  I still love it and have pretty much been using my EVOD as my go to tank.. my nova is for the ride home after I"ve vaped my EVOD empty.  ||||| I just started vaping and got two evods I stupidly filled one with lemonade and the thing broke in half within a few hours had the thing for a day. Dont use it for citrus flavors. I knew this but I figured I could use it a while without breaking but dont like I said the thing broke in half within a few hours. I got a protank now for those juices but now I got to worry about breaking the glass.   The evod is super easy to clean and the heads change out really easy. Just make sure you pick up like 10 heads so you don't have to worry about them. Also as don't let it get super low I guess they develop leaking if they do.

5671	1,0,2,3	5	Just a thought. Keep 30 man faction cap but make it where you can only ally one faction. Therefore the max alliance could be 60 and it would be rare for all 60 people to be fighting.  I think this would resolve a lot of the shit talking about outnumbering and Mexican alliance's and what not. I mean people could still be "allies" but it wouldn't be as easy to tell and stuff. ||||| If you limit it to 10 players in each faction that wouldn't really be a lot of fun. With my idea you still can have a big faction and a good ally but can't completely just dumpster everyone else with numbers. An removing allies would be great IMO. But it would probably  highly upset some people like solo facs and what not. ||||| And solo facs? ||||| then 10 in each faction = 20  or you know we can just remove allies
5589	1,3,3	7	[deleted] ||||| I hope this isn't too late!  - Make sure you do a little research. Even with retail and customer relations it's all about making sure the interview doesn't leave the impression that you are just in it for yourself. Look into the chain and find out what their value proposition is. Who do they target in terms of demographics? Is it teens? Then guess what? You are great with teens. Is it middle-class moms? Guess what...  - Practice answering standard interview questions. Google them, write down good, solid and appreciative answers and then practice saying them over and over.  - HAVE QUESTIONS! This is crucial. What are they looking for? What personalities work well in the store/on the team? What are their current staffing challenges? What does the model for success look like, or, how does one become the best employee the manager could ask for? What does a typical day look like? What does the store run like when it's really, really busy, like the day after Thanksgiving?  - Even though you didn't do it on the application, you could probably come up with an example of how you provide service if you really thought about it. Have you helped anyone with anything, ever? If so, turn that into an example. Be cheery and glad to answer, and relate that to how you are or would be with customers.  - Relate your skills to the job; you are good under pressure. You are good with down-time; you find ways to stay busy. You don't mind asking questions, and learn quickly and don't have to be told more than once or twice at the most. You like, no, you LOVE the merchandise. If you can, wear some of it to the interview. You are a team player, and have often helped fill undesirable shifts because you like to add value to a team. You like to solve problems, you like to find what it is that a person wants and deliver it. You do this through 1) Building a little rapport with a customer through a compliment or nice comment, and then 2) asking open-ended questions about what they are looking for. You think you would be good at up-selling because you are always getting compliments on your outfits (or something like that, related to the retail chain's merchandise.)  - CLOSE! Ask for the job. Something like "I really appreciate your time and consideration, and would love to know if there's something I could explain better or if there's something I could do to convince you to move me on to the next round.  - Overall, be well-rested, don't eat too much before the interview, maybe a banana or powerbar, don't chew gum, don't forget to smile and make eye contact, be as polite as you've ever been and thank them again before you are done. Also, bring extra copies of your resume along, as well as some paper and a pen for writing down notes, or even taking their contact information down. It also helps to have those questions I mentioned earlier written down so you don't forget to ask them.  - Wear a suit. I don't care what anyone says, the instances of people not getting the job because they are overdressed are either fabricated or so rare they aren't worth mentioning. Unless the manager/recruiter TELLS you not to wear a suit, wear a suit.  - Best of luck! Let us know how it goes! ||||| Take skills you've had in life and apply them to aspects of the job. Like how you work well on a team because you worked with a group for a project in class, etc. Arrive early, 5-10 minutes is good for me, anything more than that and your interviewer will feel rushed into starting the interview. Smile, make eye contact, and shake hands. Do all three while shaking your interviewers hand. If you need time to think, silence works better than "Umm". It also shows your interviewer that you are putting thought into your answer and not saying the first thing that comes to mind. Most importantly, relax! The person interviewing you isn't much different than you or I (:

6355	1,3,3	24	So Solid Snake used this tactic against both Meryl and Akiba successfully. Did they actually leave the safety on? Or was it a trick he played on rookies to make them doubt themselves, giving him an opening for CQC as their attention was drawn away momentarily?  Anyone with some gun knowledge able to see anything on the gun model in MGS4?  EDIT: Based on the gun models in MGS1 and MGS4 it is confirmed that Solid Snake did indeed trick both Meryl and Akiba, their guns did have the safeties off. He sure is sneaky.  ||||| Its been awhile since I played the games, but I'm fairly certain that their is an animation of Snake switching the safety off. I'll have to look again and will try to get back to you.  Edit: Okay, didn't look into Meryl, but I'm fairly certain that Akiba's safety is in fact, off. The motion I was remembering is just Snake racking the bolt to ensure that there was a round in the chamber. On the XM8 the safety is engaged when the fire selector is in the horizontal position, but Akiba's is rotated down to the Auto position.  ||||| Although there was a surprising amount of accuracy concerning the details of firearms throughout MGS4 (such as the sizes of the rounds that guns fired or when Snake removes the magazine from his 1911, loads one round, and drives the bolt forward, the hammer in the back can be seen in the right position to be fired), the series loses any credibility in my opinion as far as firearms when The Boss fires her Patriot rifle at the beginning of Operation Snake Eater and the bullets just tumble out in any direction. Also, there is no reason to hold or fire a rifle sideways. Which bugs me a little bit in the Phantom Pain trailer.  Sorry I can't answer your question which is completely legitimate. Both possibilities have direct implications to Snake's cunning and experience.

6314	1,3,3,3	5	I am really struggling trying to fully grasp questions that have spanning sets included, so I am coming to the reddit community for some help.  The problems that I am having problems with are:  Write the vector (1,1,3) as a linear combination of the vectors (2,-1,4,) and (3,-3,5).  Determine the span{(1,-1,2),(2,-1,3)}.   Determine whether the vector (1,1,-2) lies in the span {(3,1,2),(-2,-1,1)}.  Any help with these problems will help me out so much, thank you! ||||| >Basic math questions and homework questions will get more attention in /r/learnmath or /r/cheatatmathhomework. ||||| To get started with that first question, suppose you already had the answer. Then you'd have (1,1,3) = a(2,-1,4) + b(3,-3,5), that is, 1 = 2a+3b 1 = -a-3b 3 = 4a+5b. You've got three variable in two unknowns. Pick any two & solve them—then you should also check that the third one is solved. ||||| Well the span of a set is any linear combination of its elements by scalers in the field. I am assuming in this case these are the reals. So what you need to do in the first part is find two numbers, a and b, such that a(2,-1,4) + b(3,-3,5) = (1,1,3). If you are new to vector arithmetic, it is most often the case that the arithmetic just goes straightforward in each coordinate for addition and multiplication. So the left side of the equation above is equivalently (2a + 3b, -a - 3b , 4a + 5b). This yields the equivalent system of equations 2a + 3b = 1, -a - 3b = 1, 4a + 5b = 3. There are many ways to solve this system.

The price is roughly the same, and the GTX seems to have much better power consumption (so I might not need to replace my PSU).

6132	1,3,3,3	5	Okay a little backstory. Im 6'3 and the last time I weighed in I was 258, but could probably be near 275 now. I've basically avoided scales. I go through a cycle just about every year where I'll get fed up with my weight(around 275) and lose 25-30lbs, keep it off for a couple months, then slowly gain it back. I want to lose it for good. I want to be 220 or less as soon as possible. I just need some help with how to start, and how to continue this process. ||||| **problem analysis:**  you keep coming back to a point in your life where your desire to weigh less is at odds with your desire to do things that make you fatter, and you choose fattening things. you then **choose** fattening things **every day after that** until the next diet cycle starts, so you get fatter the majority of the year.  those are your priorities in action. you probably think you have different priorities, but you don't. you make fattening choices over weight-loss choices for the majority of your life, and this makes you unhappy.  **solution:**  make different choices. no amount of diet advice or workout planning will help you stick to your commitments. you have to choose to prioritize weight loss over everything else. that has to come from you.  when you commit to permanent change, your diet, exercise plans, successes and failures don't matter. if a diet fails, you wake up the next morning and try something else because you're committed to your goals. you never stop trying, even when you have a bad day and eat your weight in cake. you finish falling apart, learn from your mistakes, and immediately start again with something else that may work. you'll fail over and over again until you find what works for you. and that's all fine.  **an extra (controversial) opinion:**  being content is a choice anybody can make at any time.  nobody really cares if you're fat. you care, clearly, but nobody that matters is going to say "you're a bad person because of you weigh too much." If a healthy lifestyle doesn't make you happy, learn to be happy as you are. it's a perfectly valid way of life. being overweight is, albeit, a shorter life filled with health problems, physical limitations, and negative social consequences, but the unlimited cakes are a really nice perk. if that's your choice, that's fine too. just don't complain about the negatives - you get cake. ||||| Food wise, sneak in as many servings of veggies and fruits as possible. I'll have a huge salad and throw in berries, make wraps with more veggies than anything else, sneak greens into smoothies, etc.   Exercise/motivation wise: you have to want it. I've struggled with motivation my entire life. My motivation happened when I stopped smoking tobacco. I finally stopped and took a look at myself from a different POV. I realized... "You can stop smoking with a snap of your fingers, and quit for good... why can't you keep a work out schedule going? It's cheaper, healthier, and more fun than smoking and you kept that up"  Kinda had one of those "ah-ha!" moments, let myself see how much of a flat out retard I was being, and am forcing myself to get up, get going, and keep moving.  I'm sure that this doesn't really seem like advice, but truth be told, every single person on reddit could post their advice on here just for you, but until you have that moment of clarity, it's just not going to happen.  Now, with that being said, I do wish you luck on your journey, and hope that you find that moment that causes you to realize that you are truly worth it, and pushes you to push yourself. ||||| Put on the song Time by Pink Floyd. Listen and pay attention to the lyrics.  "Sitting around, on a piece of ground in your hometown, waiting for someone or something to show you the way."  This is what motivated me.  I used to make posts like this, and I spent years waiting for something to change or something to make it easier or give me some reason or motivation to lose weight. I didn't think I was doing that, but I was.  Nobody is going to be able to do this for you but yourself. I know you'll say you know that, and I know logically you do, and I'm not telling you that you shouldn't come here or ask for help. Not at all. But what I'm saying is, nobody is going to take that first step for you. You are in absolute and complete control of yourself, and while that can be scary or disheartening at times, it's empowering as well. You have the power to beat this.

4437	1,3,3,3	4	Why is it important? ||||| If you flip a coin, it has about a 50% chance to land on heads, and a 50% chance to land on tails. Of course, if you only flip it once, it comes up either 100% heads or 100% tails, never 50/50 (assuming landing on edge is a do-over). If you flip it twice, there's still a pretty good chance that it will come up heads both times. But if you flip it 10 million times, you can be pretty sure that it will come up heads very close to 50% of the time. This is the law of large numbers: if you take your statistics from a very large sample, they tend to obey mathematical laws much more closely than if you have a small sample.  One reason this is important is because it is literally the basis for everything you see and do. You interact with the universe on what is called a "macroscopic" scale. There are some nice simple laws of physics to describe what happens here; for example a ball will fall to the ground and bounce, and a gas will spread to fill its container. But as it turns out, everything on the macroscopic level is actually made of huge numbers of tiny particles, and these particles all act very differently than regular balls and things. But the law of large numbers says that even if some of the particles act differently than we would expect, because there are so many of them it seems to us that they all act together according to the statistical laws. The part of science that determines what the statistical laws are, by the way, is called thermodynamics. ||||| The Law of Large Numbers simply says that as the number of trials of a particular (independent) probabilistic event increases, the number of each observed result will approach its expected value.  In the coin-flipping example, the probability of heads is 1/2 or 50%.  If I flip a coin N times, the expected value of the number of times it comes up heads is 0.5*N.  If I actually try an experiment and flip the coin 10 times, I probably won't see exactly 5, but I'm 90% likely to see between 4 and 6 (making these numbers up).  If I flip it 1000 times, I'm 90% likely to see between 496 and 504, which is a more precise range relatively speaking.  Basically, it's important because it's an underlying assumption of all of statistics.  It's important to note that getting a long string of heads in a row doesn't make tails any more likely on subsequent (independent) trials.  The coin doesn't magically "correct itself" to balance out to be 50/50.  Sometimes in a dramatic situation like that, we feel that the next one just HAS be tails... but the coin is just the same as it ever was.  This is called the Gambler's Fallacy. ||||| Let's say you flip a coin. Heads or tails, right? It's always going to land on one of two possible outcomes and it has an equal chance of happening either way. The law of large numbers says that the more times you flip that coin and average out the landings, the closer to 50/50 the landing percentage will be.  Dunno why it's important, though. lol I guess as a proof of probability.

7541	1,3,2,2,3	19	20f, SO is 21m. One child together.  We met on the internet, two years ago.. Have had a strong relationship since the birth of our child. We see each other constantly (even before our daughter). We have our own friends (his is on the computer, mostly) and which i try to find time for myself outside of the house from time to time. Or even time for myself. He works 9-5, Mon-Fri. Then comes home and works on something else. He does make time for child. I appreciate what he does for myself and our child.  I try to spend time with him, and such... but it seems like he wont sacrifice time for me. His father has even said something to him a few days ago that he needs to spend time with his family..

2395	1,3,3	6	Does anyone else find Amazon Instant an awful interface? I used to use Lovefilm and switched over to Netflix. Recently downloaded the instant app on the PS4 and finding movies included in the subscription is a grind. It feels like the bulk of the films and shows on there requre further payment. All I wanted to do was watch Hannibal and now I have to pay £20 per season. Looks like I'll be buying the boxset and supporting the local high street stores instead.  Is it just like this on the PS4 or is there a better means of watching the available content I don't have to pay for (other than the subscription)? ||||| On a Roku, the 'free' Prime movies/TV shows have their own section linked off the opening page.  The situation with Hannibal being a rental/purchase item is an issue of licensing. Amazon decides whether to offer Hannibal for free based on 1) whether the media company will license it at all, 2) the cost to license it for free streaming and 3) how popular it will be in a given country.  Moreflicks.com indicates the only pay-once-watch-many services that offer Hannibal are Hulu, and Netflix in Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden.  You have to be careful with Hulu because sometimes TV shows are licensed only for playback on a computer screen and cannot be directly streamed to a TV. ||||| the interface is a little hard to use but what really bothers me is paying a yearly fee for prime video only to be required to pay extra for way to many videos.

6415	1,0,3,1,3,3,2,0	20	I haven't seen any posts on this game, but recently I've been trying out a bunch of MMOs, and I came across this title and thought it was actually a pretty solid game. It's got some cool new features that I was happy to see. The most notable being the removal of traditional quest givers. You still have NPCs/merchants but most of the quests are given to you on the fly as you complete others.  It makes questing feel very streamlined, and removes the tedium of backtracking/finding quest givers. It's also got some pretty fun PVP combat, the graphics and music is very good. I definitely recommend it. [URL] Here's a video. Today's probably not a good day to be posting this as the server will be down on the 2nd - they're officially releasing the game, it's just wrapping up it's open beta phase.  ||||| Graphics look nice but I HATE gender locked games ||||| I'll definitely give it a try after seeing this video. I love the fact that it seems so sleek and stuff is exposed to you correctly.  That's not something I'm used to see in f2p mmorpg's. ||||| I agree, I was playing on the PH servers before the new ones were launched and was having a great time.   In fact, I had been invited into the SW:TOR testing way back in August of last year, and I was actually neglecting it due to Dragona. That's not to say I would recommend it to the average gamer over TOR, but in my particular case I was having enough fun with it that I put TOR on the backburner. Especially when I wanted to just mindlessly grind away without listening to quest text or figuring out where to go.   I think the main thing that attracted me to the game was that the combat was just really fun, better than TOR in my opinion. World bosses were also nicely spaced throughout the questing process, encouraging quick grouping with others to take them down. I was using that little cat girl with all of the traps and the combat was a blast. PvP was fun too, but I had a hard time playing in large groups because I couldn't speak Tagalog, which most of the players used on my server.   I may hop back in now that they are officially launching. Let me know if you have a decent guild to recommend. ||||| Downloading now...seems cool! Thanks for the recommendation.  ||||| This game is decent. It's not amazing, pretty average MMORPG, but it's enjoyable, especially for a FTP game. ||||| Hey OP, Do you know of any class build guides? Trying to find a good solid class and build for pve. Playing a gunner atm but im putting points wherever and feel like I might mess up :P  Cheers! ||||| I can't get over the art.

5266	1,3,2,3,3,3	6	Abathur has been revived his previous glory that was lost after the beta patch. The monstrosity ultimate no longer sucks and is not squishy at all. I have had games won with Abathur today by doing nothing but push. The monstrosity does a lot of dmg as well as can get "TANKY' you heard me right: TANKY. I have been on a win streak today even when i had shit team comps the push that is generated just dominates the opposing team late game.  **If you guys want to know my build:**  1. Survival Instincts : Increases Locust's Health by 30% and duration by 40%.  2. Sustained Carapace : Increases the duration of Symbiote's Carapace by 50% and allows it to persist after Symbiote ends.  3. Networked Carapace : Using Symbiote's Carapace on a Minion or Mercenary also applies Carapace to all nearby allied Minions and Mercenaries.  4. Evolve Monstrosity : Turn an allied Minion or Locust into a Monstrosity for 60 seconds. When enemy Minions near the Monstrosity die, it gains 4% Health and 4% Basic Attack damage, stacking up to 30 times.Using Symbiote on the Monstrosity allows you to control it, in addition to Symbiote's normal benefits.  5. Assault Strain (Trait) : Locust Basic Attacks cleave, and explode on death for 50 damage.  6. Locust Brood : Activate to spawn 3 Locusts at a nearby location.  7.  Locust Nest : Activate to create a nest that periodically spawns Locusts. Only one Locust Nest can be active at a time.  **Thank you blizzard for making Abathur awesome again, I am going to get my lvl 10 today hopefully and definitely buy his master skin.**  Fellow Abathur's Go ahead and try this build out and you will have a lot of fun. Enjoy and P.S. *Abathur Master Race* ||||| I bought Abathur yesterday on sale. But didn't play him yet. Anyway this week is lost ti vikings. But still dying to try abathur out.

490	1,3,3,3,3	8	[empty] ||||| When I was 15, I was staying in a hotel with my family and a friend for New Years (we were attending a wedding). At around 1 AM after the turn of the year, I decide to take the 10 story trip to the lobby to procure some ice cream for my friend, my little brother, and myself (we were sharing a room) to celebrate New Years. I'm wary of all the durnk people staying in the hotel, so I stay away from the elevators and take a long flight of stairs down to the first floor, where I know it's right next to the lobby store.   I get the ice cream, and get back to the door to the flight of stairs, only to find that it's locked - it can only be accessed by one side. I instead have to take the large grand staircase in the lobby up to the 2nd floor, where I can access the flight of stairs from there. I walk quickly and try to remain unnoticed. The door to the flight of stairs is right by a set of benches with (seemingly) under aged teenagers - as I get through the door, one of them slurs "GET BACK HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT!!" and starts after me. I *sprint* up the stairs for a couple flights, but I realize that I can't do that for all 10 stories. He's much slower coming up than I (surprisingly, being drunk makes it difficult to run up stairs), so I deliberately start slowing down so he can catch up.   As he gets close, I turn around and kick him in the face so he falls down 7-8 stairs. It was easy since he had little to no balance. He stopped moving at the bottom, and I waited for a second before running back to my room. He didn't look too good, and to this day I don't know how badly I hurt him.   But I guess that's what you get for trying to beat the shit out of a kid.  ||||| Drunk guy kept asking me if I had "10,13". As in, "you got 10,13? 10,13???"  Then he tried to touch my groin.  ||||| I was walking along when I saw a guy trying to swim down the sidewalk and asked if he was alright. He replied, "Fuck you Jerry!" And kept swimming. ||||| I spent a solid 30 minutes talking with an inebriated former marine.  When he finished his story, I complimented him with how much respect I had for him and the rest of his team.  For some reason, he thought I was being sarcastic and suddenly wanted to fight me.  Fortunately he had a slightly more sober friend who was able to walk him away before it turned physical.
20	1,3,2	6	Hey guys, I'm relatively new to OSRS members (I primarily played f2p rs2) and the member content is really awesome so far, really enjoying most of the skills, minigames, and areas opened up to me. Since bonds exist now, I'm trying to save up money so I can keep buying bonds to upkeep my membership.   My friend told me barrows is good money, so I spammed it a lot, and while I can kill it pretty reliably now it feels like I'm not getting a good number of runs per inventory; I can only get 5-6 trips in before I'm out of food or prayer, doing 14 kill count per chest. My friend said I should be getting 8 trips per inventory with my character's combat skill levels. Here are [my stats]([URL] and [the setup]([URL] I've been running.   What should I change to do barrows more efficiently? Are there specific tricks to killing the brothers that I don't know about, which allows all the people to stay so long without banking?  A lot of the barrows guides I found on the internet said to use items such as the Abyssal Whip, Saradomin Godsword, Toxic Blowpipe, or full Guthan the Infested's set, and while I would love to have them, my bank and melee stats sadly aren't there yet. Are they 100% necessary to barrow efficiently? If so, should I grind out my melee stats and gold until I can obtain and use them?   Thanks in advance for everyone's time, I'd greatly appreciate any tips you veterans could give me.  ||||| You can probably get like 2 chests a trip with those stats and no guthans and the toxic trident is probably making you lose money so I would sell that and work towards guthans/ or mortania legs 3 to teleport after every trip ||||| I assume you use tele to shades of morton? if so then 5-6 chests is enough for tele to recharge so thats a quick bank and you wouldnt really need to do more.  besides that you can scratch basically all potions besides restore and prayer. get good defence armour and bring alot more prayer potions, maybe one stamina if you feel like its needed. safespot all melee brothers to save on prayer pots, just spawn em in tunnels.  I would also say bring melee gear and scratch range gear. normal trident is basically just as effective and more cost efficient so you can spend more on armour and supplies.  sorry for messy writing am doin barrows as I type gl and dont give up. I go 100+ dry often and in the long run it will always balance out.

4890	1,3,3,3	6	I was watching a lets play of the new Need for Speed Most Wanted ([URL] and it frustrated me because all it was is a new burnout game with the Need for Speed name stuck on it! Don't get me wrong I love the burnout series but when I heard they were making Need for Speed Most Wanted I was incredibly excited. Unfortunately its barely a Need for Speed game. The story is non existent, the car customisation is purely performance no visual changes, there is absolutely no sense of earning anything like cars or parts because all you have to do is drive around and get in a car that's sitting by the road and suddenly you have unlocked it! They even have take downs in burnout style and when you crash it's identical to when you crash in a burnout game (except it says crashed instead of wasted.) I mean seriously?   TL;DR I want a decent most wanted remake or sequel not another burnout game. ||||| >not another burnout game  Theres only 1 for PC, I for one am very glad you describe it the way you do since thats exactly what I'm hoping for! ||||| Well, it IS made by Criterion, so I wouldn't really expect much different from Burnout... ||||| Called it as soon as the words appeared at E3.

583	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	11	I am 32 years old and I have never had a dog or any other pet. I grew up close to my grandparents dairy farm in NJ.   My fiancé and I are getting a dog.  She is also hell bent on sneaking hamburgers to every dog she sees. How do I make sure this dog is a good dog.?  ||||| Two things and not everyone is gonna agree with them:  1.  Crate training.  Until your dog gets housebroken, keep him in a crate during nighttime or when you're at work and he's home alone.  A dog will NOT shit in his own crate.  Once he learns, then you can just leave the crate open all the time and he will use it for the rest of his life as a place to sleep and get away from the world.  2.  Shock collar.  They are wonderful training devices for those of us that aren't dog-whisperers.  My dog loved ignoring me once he got off the leash until he realized I had "god powers" and could affect him from a distance.  It literally transformed our relationship.  Read up on several websites on how to do it correctly.  If your dog yips when you shock him, you got it set TOO HIGH. ||||| Give him or her love and hope that they will return it. Thats all you really can do. :) ||||| walk it every day. the walk is the most important thing to your dog, and you walk it, not it walks you. google how to properly walk a dog and get as much info as possible about the breed you want to get, there is no bigger mistake then having the wrong breed for the owner, and also google dog training learn as much about that as possible aswell ||||| pick him up if he doesnt squirm around he's a good one. like if he just lays there like "okayy" haha. that's what i've been told. my dog doesnt, and she's awesome. there's also training. ||||| Do yourself a favor and research breeds before you make a choice. Please make sure that you get a dog appropriate for your living situation and schedules.  Here's a link to key things to keep in mind when picking a dog: [URL]  Of course, hit up the shelters and rescue groups before going to a breeder and please don't buy from a pet store. Their dogs tend to come from puppy mills rather than caring breeders.  ||||| Walks every day, proper training you both need to stick with the same rules. You must show your dog that you are the dominant member, though do this in a loving caring way. Example: If you are going to bed you and your fiance should be the first in the bed and once you are settled in, then invite the dog to join you. Also when you gt home from a walk have your dog sit before you open the door and you walk in before the dog.  We adopted my dog from the pound, we are so loving towards him and he had some bad habits when we first got him, also probably wasn't used to being in a home. He always lays down when I put the leash on him to go for a walk, he waits to come into the house, he knows he has to be invited onto the bed.  ||||| don't let her give it hamburgers ||||| Make sure that everyone in the household will abide by the disciplinary rules that you are going to set forth for the dog.  If one person isn't going along with how the dog is to be treated for it's actions the dog will become confused - everyone needs to be consistent.  EDIT:  This in my opinion is one of the most over looked things when people own a dog.  ||||| Ah, I see what you mean ;)  I remember my ‘first dog’....  There can be a lot of pressure to your first time - that is, ‘owning a dog for the first time’. ‘Owning a dog’ just because you want to ‘own a dog’, or because you think all your friends ‘own a dog’, is something you may regret later. You might feel lots of anxieties, especially the first time your ‘owning a dog’ (often referred to as ‘getting a pet’). You may feel embarrassed about how you look without your clothes on, or worried about your privacy being disturbed. It's natural to worry, but good communication can really help. You should be able to talk to your ‘new dog’ about your concerns and how you feel about having a ‘new dog’ for the first time. Your ‘new dog’ might be worried too, and talking can really ease the tension. If you're too shy, or you're not able to talk about these things with your ‘dog’, then you probably shouldn't be ‘getting a new dog’.  Hope this helps and that you enjoy your ‘new dog’!  ;)
8045	1,3,3,3	7	Any advice on how to use scoped chargers? I seem to do horrible with them and can't snap my snipes as well. Another thing is that it gets very jerky when I'm in scope mode and I still have the lowest sensitivity. ||||| Stack damage ups not to have to go all-in with the scope.  Also, make sure you're sitting on a chair that doesn't move. With chargers, a lot of things in real life will mess up your aim in game. ||||| Never hold in a full charge and scan for people, or even follow them for them to come in range. You need your full range of vision to make sure no one is sneaking up behind you. (I've got a few people off guard like that, I've also been caught off guard.)  The damage up recommendation is a good one so that you can snatch kills as soon as you start to zoom in. ||||| One thing if found very important for using chargers is that anytime you aim it, a laser is visible to the enemy team and your teammates.  This makes you a very visible target to the other team and they will know when you are trying to snipe them if you are not careful.   Good charger users often will hide their laser by aiming down or at something else, then snapping their aim to their target.  It takes some practice!  Chargers are a challenging weapon, but can be great if you put in the time.

Mine was putting my controller down and accidentally shooting Eileen...oops ;-; ||||| [URL]   one.. gunshot away. this one fucked with me for a while ||||| Yesterday, I summoned OH Henriett to help me kill Amelia, I got invaded by a player wearing the Cainhurst armor and using the Chikage. It was a new character that I had started to try an ARC build. Needless to say, he killed me. As I went back to where I was killed (where the sinister bell maiden spawns in Cathederal Ward) to recollect my blood echoes, I notice that the gate is locked (the Wooden Shield gate). So I go around to the circular area with the 2 church giants to use that shortcut, and I see that is locked as well. This son-of-a-bitch locked all my shortcuts and made me go around the entire place just to unlock everything again. Wasn't the worst setback ever, I just thought it was a dick move. Kinda funny though, now, looking back. ||||| Gathering 3 Emb.

Ended up backing into a corner (I thought I had more leeway) and she killed me right as I was in the process of healing.  Posted the vid to Facebook and even friends who've never played the game were giving me all their sympathies. ||||| At Ludwig, 2nd phase, I had summoned someone to help me because I had spent literally hours trying to kill him. The summon had done basically all the work and got him about to very near death. With his health bar low and victory in sight I got the "this might actually happen!" vibe in my head. I immediately ran up trying to act like a badass... and then he does the quick two swipe backdash killing me instantly... :(  My spirit broken, my insight low and my blood vials not refilling I turned the power off pretty quickly. ||||| Same as every souls game: rushing back to a boss room and falling down the elevator shaft because i forget to call the lift back down... bye bye souls ||||| The other day I was summoned to help someone in the first area of the DLC.

I was getting so nervous and healing and when I got close to her, she slammed down and killed me. I was so pissed off. ||||| As a cooperator in the Forbidden Woods, I was waiting for the host to finish looting the little town area, and shot the cannon just as he was rounding a corner to the blast zone. ||||| Sort of a Success/Failure at the same time.  I'm a new player, and I must've tried to kill that goddamn hunter in the tower with the Gatling Gun 15-20 times. Leveled up to 50 or so and went back to fight him.  I was dodging better than I ever was before, but he'd still counter with that fucking blunderbuss. The fight was neck and neck, but I managed to get him to the edge and KNOCK HIS ASS OFF... before executing an additional, unnecessary R2 with Ludwig's Holy Sword... and fell to my death along with him.  It didn't even feel like a victory after that. I had won, but at the cost of my pride. ||||| My best fail is pretty fresh... Couple of days ago I was helping ppl with Mico boss fight when suddenly my cousin that works in another country just walks in saying hi like it was no big deal. Of course I want to go hug her and have a chat, I had no idea she was visiting! Problem is, I was in the middle of the fight and leaving after your beckoner has already started and can't get another summon is a giant dick move, so I tell her that I'd be right there just give me a minute, and I try to rush the battle.  Micolash clearly gets wind of this and does his best to be a contrary bitch, running away in all directions BUT where he's supposed to. We finally get to second phase, I run to that point where you can jump on him from above, but instead of turning to that small side room where you can do so, I walk straight off where the bridge pops after the battle and die istantly.  I should've saved the clip, it was SO DUMB. ||||| I should post the video once I upload it... I don't ever record video, but I decided it might be fun to do a video of a 3 on one vs. the Queen.  I have fought the Queen at least 15-20 times now helping various people... I have never died.   Start recording as we approach the door, enter, run up to the queen and get bound... she spews blood (most of my life gone) and then does the little explosion thing (rest of my life gone)... first death on the Queen and it was my first attempt at recording the fight...  So much fail :(

7537	1,3,3,3	4	I’ve been with my boyfriend Alex for nearly 2 years now. We had a rocky few months a while back that led to us breaking up, but we have gotten back together and tried to fix our issues and I think we have come a long way. This isn’t necessarily relevant to the question I’m asking, but I’m just providing it by way of background.  Alex is an extrovert and he has a large, really active group of friends. They’re nice people. They really like to party, but they’re loyal and good to one another. They’re just kind of closed off––they’re never rude to outsiders, but like any group of friends they have a lot of inside jokes, have been travelling together, have their own dynamic, etc. I’m an introvert, and I have a smaller group of friends. Around my friends, I’m known as the funny, sarcastic one; I'm not socially awkward and I feel confident and comfortable. While Alex occasionally asks me to tag along to group activities our groups of friends are really separate, and have been since we started dating. For some reason, I just get extremely socially awkward when I’m around them and I can’t explain why. I’m nervous, my jokes come out wrong, I seem standoffish and rude. They’re nice to me but I sometimes feel awkward because they’re such a close group.   Alex also is quite independent and when we go out in groups he’s not glued to my side or anything; oftentimes he’ll spend the whole night chatting up various friends. I’m fine with this, but I sometimes feel this makes me act even more awkwardly. We’re in college now, and back in high school I was 20 pounds overweight, didn’t take care of myself, was fiercely standoffish, and never really ‘got’ how to be social. I’ve since overcome most of that, and I’m much more secure in myself now. But Alex’s friends remind me of the sort of people who would ignore me in high school; even though they really are very nice to me, I think I regress some when I spend time with them and become that socially awkward teenager again. I think this is exacerbated by the fact that his friends are a mixed group of mostly attractive girls (he didn’t choose them like this, they all basically lived in the same dorm freshman year). It makes me really dislike spending time with Alex when he’s around his friends, since he seems so at ease and so included and I’m not. I don’t expect to be part of their group, but I just wish I didn’t feel so painfully different. I do wish he acknowledged me more in the group or was more affectionate to me around other people, but that’s just not him.  I don’t spend a lot of time with Alex’s friends, but I need to figure out how to stop seeming so bitchy. It just seems like we all don’t vibe on the same wavelength. They’re really nice to me, but I still am an outsider, and I don’t know how to get comfortable. Over the summer I easily integrated into my older brother Joe’s group of friends and got really comfortable around them even though they were strangers, I just can’t figure out why I can’t do this with Alex even after two years. I get hyper-aware of everything I say around them and my body movements, which makes me seem even weirder and more unnatural.  **TL;DR: I act super awkward around my boyfriend’s friends and I want to stop.** ||||| I think part of the problem is you're tackling these people as part of a larger, pre-established group.    You say that you interact with these people when your BF invites you to group outings.   It sounds like you're trying to eat a steak in one bite.  All these people at once.  And you're obviously choking on it.  I suggest a "divide and conquer" strategy.  Start hanging out with these people in trio situations: You, your BF, and one of them at a time.  Organize activities that involve just those combinations.  Get comfortable with them on an individual level and my guess is you'll start feeling better in the larger group outings. ||||| Okay I think you should try and tackle people in this group one by one. Who has been the nicest and most open to you? Start with that person. A sure in is COMPLIMENTING THEM. this is an easy and effective way of connecting and starting conversation. "Oh I love your shoes... Where'd you get them?" if they mention a travel place, ask them questions about it! Basically ask questions and let them ramble on to you. Maybe do this at a bar or something and gather some of that liquid courage. Suggest future fun things to do. Share funny stories that happened to you recently.   I am also an introvert and socially awkward. I recently moved to a new city and had to make all new friends in a new grad program and at work.   I MADE myself smile and laugh and ask questions and suggest outings. And by god it worked. I even infiltrated a friend group. You can do it!  ||||| Organize an event. Maybe a game night or a movie night or something. At the end of the night, give a big soppy speech about how much you like hanging out with everyone and how sometimes you get nervous because everyone is so cool. 
6064	1,3,3,2	4	I don't really know how I feel about my situation, I feel like I should've been born female but it's not like I'm overly girly or anything. I tried women's clothes when I was younger and I loved how they felt but as I got older I grew a lot of body hair and my shoulders became very broad.  I'm not really comfortable coming out to people but I want to become more confident. Basically is there anyone who could give me some advice on how to feminize myself? I don't really want to start hormones until I'm comfortable with myself. ||||| Maybe start waxing then cross dressing a bit?

812	1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	34	(Was just suggested to post here for input, as well.  Thanks in advance for any input!)  My wife and I are looking for some advice or opinions on a situation we are having with my father-in-law, who lives in Beijing. We thought this would be a good place to get some thoughts, and any feedback would be greatly appreciated!  **Background:** I'm Caucasian, and my wife is Chinese, born in Beijing. She came to the U.S. at the age of 13 to live with her mother. There was a lull of about 10 years for my wife having any communication with her father, but that has been re-established and I would say that since then it has been great, and very healthy, up till the last 10 months. Often, it is has been a much better relationship than with her mother, but that is a different story. They talk on the phone every few weeks, and her and I have been back to visit five times. I proposed to my wife in Beijing, after getting permission from her father. One time my entire family (parents, two brothers, and a sister-in-law) went and everyone was treated amazingly well. Her father has ALWAYS been kind to me, and I have nothing bad to say about him, other than he is too generous! He has often said that once he will come visit and help take care of his grandchildren, cook, and travel.  Her father has remarried and has another daughter, now 17. I would say that our relationship with my wife's step-mother and step-sister is not the best, but it is not terrible or bad. They treat us well when we are there, but they are definitely cut from a different cloth than my wife or her father.  When we announced the pregnancy of our daughter (1st kid), her dad and step-mother were really supportive, her step-mom was nicer than expected. We went back to visit during her pregnancy, and one bump that occurred (no pun intended) was my wife throwing out the idea of our daughter (and future child) visiting them during the summer break when they are older for upwards of a month to spend time in China, and gain exposure to the culture and language. This really freaked out the step-mother (who has health complications) and wanted nothing to do with caring for our kid(s), and became a little hostile / angry about the idea. After we returned back to the US, we felt a noticeable drop-off in frequency of phone calls and interest and involvement in our future-daughter.  **Issue:** In June of this year our daughter was born. We called immediately to inform her family in China, and they gave their congratulations. After that, we received zero follow-up calls. In Chinese culture, the first 30 days are viewed very critical for both babies and mothers and becomes an important milestone once reached. It hurt my wife's feelings but we finally called to let them know how things were going a month after the baby was born, and were told that they hadn't called because they figured we'd be busy. We accepted that, even though it felt weird. During this, our other parents including her Chinese mother called regularly checking on us. The trend has continued through and it almost feels like we are in a cold war. We send photos and videos via e-mail, and receive zero replies of any kind: E-mail or phone calls. We do call, ask if they had seen the photos, and are told "yes, we received them." There is no feedback or comment about the photos, other than one sarcastic joke from the step-sister asking where the blond hair and blue eyes are. (I have brown hair and brown eyes.) We aren't fishing for compliments but feel a real lacking in that there are no thoughts about our child. This is her father's first grandchild, after all. We ask "What do you think, or why didn't you reply?" and are told "She looks pretty good so we don't have any concerns to express. You guys are good parents." Her father does occasionally call, and did so recently asking if we were affected by the recent bad weather. We live in the mid-west and used to be 30 minutes from Washington, IL, where we have family nearby still.  I personally feel that the step-mom is pulling some strings here. We speculate my father-in-law may speak more freely to my wife when he isn't in her presence. He doesn't totally backup some of what the step-mother has told my wife. i.e. "Don't come back till your daughter is 5 or 6, she's too young and may get sick!" Her dad tries to smooth over the message and just says that the step-mom is concerned about health. I do not feel this is the true story. Personally, I think she doesn’t want to deal with our daughter. We question if my father-in-law smooth over these messages because he doesn't like confrontation (with us) or trying to hint he wants to see us (without upsetting the step mother).  We have just booked tickets to go to Beijing next late September through early October, and even extended the trip by a few days, as her dad seemed to be disappointed we were only staying for 10 days initially. We sent more photos, and called last night to tell him we were extending the visit by a couple days . His response was "ok, do what you think is best." And regarding the new photos, we again had to ask if he received them, and we were told "yes, we have seen them."  Now, we are really second guessing the entire trip. This will not be an easy trip (dealing with baby jet lag and risking that our daughter may get sick) and will be financially significant for cost visas, plane tickets, hotel stay, etc. If we are not welcomed to, we may just not go. We have tried to ask if there is an issue, but we are always placated, and told that nothing is wrong. We cannot get over this gnawing feeling that things have changed, they are somehow discouraging of our daughter, and that they see us coming as a bother.  **Question:** We are wondering if her father's reaction is perhaps something more typical in Chinese culture where positive feedback is not really given. Are their reactions normal, and are we overanalyzing the situation? Maybe only negative feedback and areas of improvement are topics of discussion? Just looking for feedback, and if our expectations are too high. What is your read on the situation?  **tl;dr;** We want to bring our new daughter to China to visit her family (and especially maternal Grandfather there) for the first time, but they don't seem to care at all, or have any emotional connection in our attempts to share photos and video. What is the deal?  **Bonus!** One of the photos in question of my two favorite people: [URL]  ||||| Do you speak to your father in law and that whole family in Chinese or English? Do they talk to you in English or Chinese? I feel like what they're saying to you in English seems kind of cold and stand-off ish, but in comparison, saying the exact same stuff in Chinese... doesn't really appear to be out of the norm. This is kind of the exact same kind of conversation I have with my dad, my stepmom, or my grandparents in Chinese. "Hey, I sent you an email with things." "Ok I got it and I saw it, ok". "Hey I'm coming home for the holidays." "Ok let me know when you get here." "Hey I'm making dumplings, advice?" "Put some vegetables in it, I know how you are." It seems really awkward now that I translate it to English, but in Chinese it's actually pretty damn normal. I tell my girlfriend the things my dad say and she thinks he's totally mean, but... well, not really, I just don't really know how to translate something and keep the same connotations and emotions and tone without going overboard with explanatory citations.  And also, I'm not so sure that it's so much a "Chinese culture" difference but more of a perceived gap between you guys and the family. Some families share their stuff more than others, some families are more enthusiastic than others. My mom's side of the family is infinitely more enthusiastic about things than my dad's side, that's just how they are. When I talk to my dad's side of the family the phone calls are like 5-10 minutes long, my mom's side will keep me on the phone for an hour, that's just how it is. I wouldn't attribute it exactly to "Chinese culture at odds with American culture" per se but more to the variation in people's behavior even within a culture.  Also, even if they don't tell you straight up what they're feeling, they'd probably tell your wife what they are, or at least it's more direct. My parents wouldn't tell anyone else anything but they lay it to me straight all the time. What does your wife say think her dad and stepmom are doing?  Then again, I feel like my family is more progressive than most Chinese families I know and they tend to be more hands-off with a lot of things that my aunts and uncles and whatnot would be more involved in, so it could have skewed my view. You should at least get on the same page in the same language and then work your way from there though. ||||| > "She looks pretty good so we don't have any concerns to express. You guys are good parents."  I told my wife this (who is also from Beijing) and she said this was a pretty big compliment for Chinese. Listen to snackburros, he should know, and I'll also back him up and say that giving out too many compliments can be seen as potentially building up too much "false" confidence in a person which might reduce their drive for success.  > "Don't come back till your daughter is 5 or 6, she's too young and may get sick!"  We just had a case where an 8 year old girl got lung cancer and many parents are becoming quite worried. This could be it or, as you said, it could be something else and they're only giving you the half of it. This can also be part of the communication here though; decisions will seemingly be made for you and then you will be told why those decisions are good for you, so it's hard to judge the intention of this sentence. My wife seems to think the step-mom doesn't want to be bothered however. That may not be cultural though. That may just be human survival instinct. The step-mother has to ensure the survival of her own daughter and she may perceive your wife and daughter to be a threat to her and her own daughter.   Also, quick question: Is your wife's half sister going to school in China or abroad? Compare your wife with her half sister. Who would you say is more successful? Chinese tend to be extremely competitive and this may figure into any reasons of hesitation. ||||| I don't know. Doesn't sound as bad as my wife's dad. He's ultra nong,, a real farmer who barely finished 6th grade. He doesn't know anything about children, doesn't know how to approach/talk to/play with our 2 year old, drinks baijiu every day, smokes 2 packs and basically is the poster boy for nongminism. He's got the thickest local accent and dialect so I don't understand a word he says. After 3 years I'm still to find a single thing we have in common.  ||||| Could be a fight happening over inheritance. Step-mom wants to ensure she isn't left off the will (especially if she is younger than grandpa), and thinks that the grand-daughter isn't being used as a bargaining chip.   Is there an older generation involved, as well? ||||| It seems fairly crude yet obvious to say this, but have you ever considered the possibility that maybe their lack of interest in your child is due to the fact that she is a girl? ||||| I don't understand your problem here, the "step grandma" doesn't want to take care your girl, big deal.  ||||| >"Don't come back till your daughter is 5 or 6, she's too young and may get sick!"  It's actually somewhat true. Kids born in america frequently lack the immune system for the beefed up chinese super germs. So, word of advice is, let her go back when she is 5 or 6 and have a relatively better immune system, keep a close eye on her. And in the event that she does catch something, dose her with as much amoxicillin you can find.  >"She looks pretty good so we don't have any concerns to express. You guys are good parents."  I'd agree that it is showing that they obviously do no like your daughter more than perhaps their own daughter. This is coming from a guy whose grand parents hated him so much, they forced him to watch his cousins play with his toys. :(  I'd say they certainly aren't giving enough care right now. Who knows, your father-in-law may feel a change of heart. ||||| DAE hate how the meaning of 'disinterested' has become corrupted to mean 'uninterested'?

7512	1,3,3	13	I don’t know what to do about my relationship. My boyfriend is lazy and whatever the opposite of diligent, pro-active, determined and disciplined is. We’re both in school right now. I have my career figured out and I have a good start so that’s taken care of, but we have no idea what he’s going to do after he graduates and he doesn’t seem too eager to figure it out. I want to give him some time, because maybe he’s just a late bloomer, but I’ve been dating him for a year and I haven’t seen much progress. I don’t need him to be rich or anything, but I don’t want to have to provide for him. Plus he has much more expensive tastes than I do, which doesn’t suit his career prospects very well. I’m not sure I can live with the burden of being a main provider, or even the likelihood of becoming the main provider.   I just wish he could be self-sufficient. He has never worked full-time so I don’t know if he can hold a job. Well, he had a full-time internship once but he quit after a month because he said he would go insane if he stayed there. Then he took some time off and went back to school for another degree, and a few years later, here he is. He had to change his major because his grades weren’t good enough and then went through a few options that didn’t work out because they were either too much work or not interesting enough or something of that sort. Last spring, he said he wanted to find a part time job for the coming term. After a few weeks, he finally got started on his resume but never finished it until the end of the year (two terms later) because I made him finish it. I also talked to him about how he needs to get things done and how it worries me about our future. He agreed that he should get things done because he doesn’t like being lazy and he wants our relationship to work out.   I don’t want to nag him and I don’t want to try to change him, ever. That never goes well. I often remind him at times when it seems like he’s slacking too much but I don’t want to have to do that. I want him to do something because he decides to do it. The problem is if things (without a school deadline) were left up to him they never get done. It’s not like he’s super busy. He spends so much time watching shows and playing games, or just browsing. And it’s not like he’s stupid. He’s had teachers comment on how much more he could achieve if only he put some effort into it. I feel so hopeless. He wants to have a good career obviously, but doesn’t have the discipline or work ethics to do what it takes. It doesn’t help that most of his friends are rich kids who go out and have fun all the time. He doesn’t have the luxury to live like them. Right now he’s just living on student debt and whatever his parents give him. I wouldn’t suggest abandoning his friends or anything, they’re nice people. I just hope he really understands what it means to not be able to just inherit a source of income but have to build one for himself.   I think I made it pretty clear that I’m not ok with him being a slacker when I talked to him a month ago about his habits. According to him, he’s more hard-working now. He finally applied for a few part time jobs, which is great. He hasn’t heard anything back yet, and when I said he should apply for more, he agreed, but I fear as usual that most of his spare time is going to be spent watching shows and playing games. There’s nothing wrong with watching shows and playing games. It just bothers me because it keeps him from doing the things he needs to do.    Sometimes I get depressed thinking about this relationship. Did I work so hard to set up my own life so that someone else can mooch off of me later? Am I selfish for thinking that? I've always worked hard and will probably always work hard given the career I've chosen, so it's hard to watch someone be so lazy and think about making a life with him. Maybe I just don’t love him enough. Maybe if I loved him more, I wouldn’t mind the likelihood of having to provide for him.   I guess I’m in a waiting phase right now. I’ve just talked to him a month ago about this issue and he has taken some action. How long is too long to wait? What kind of outcome should I be looking for anyway? I’m sure lots of people don’t have their life figured out, which is perfectly fine, but I wish he would try a little harder. I wish he cared a little more. We could be so happy and so comfortable together but his laziness really dulls my outlook on this relationship.  Has anyone been in or know of a similar situation? How did it turn out? What kind of compromises had to be made?   TL;DR: My boyfriend’s laziness is killing me.    ||||| You mention nothing about what he brings to the relationship. Honestly, it sounds like you're ready for an adult relationship and he's not and that's a perfectly good reason to move on.  ||||| Don't carry this boy on your back. He will be a burden to you, and he won't change until he has to, to survive. Some people are just lazy, and it's good that you don't want to change him, because you can't.   He isn't like you... Clearly you have ambition and a good work ethic, look for someone who shares those qualities, and say goodbye to this boy.

Seems to be well known. Gives the feeling of an American metropolis in the 50-70s or something, Chicago or NY etc. I think the NBA commercials focused on the Bulls so it might have to do with Chicago.

Yesterday I saw some old street performer playing it with a local traditional brass instrument, after contemplating how much I should give not to look like an idiot, I gave him 3 euros and asked "nice song what's it called", and he was like "I don't know, I only know hot to play it".  ||||| [George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue?]([URL] ||||| Could it have been [Boogie Stop Shuffle]([URL] by Mingus?

I'd love some recommendations for food/locations I can visit within my short stay.  Thus far, I've considered going to the BMW Museum, [this]([URL] restaurant, and Viktualienmarkt. ||||| Munich is a great place to go in 12 hours because many good attractions are in the same area.  I would advise you to go to Marienplatz and Augustiner-Keller at least. Marienplatz is accessible directly from the subway (which also goes to the airport). And from there you can easily see Max-joseph-platz, Marienhof, Frauenkirche, and Peterskirche within a couple hours.  I wasn't very impressed by the BMW museum, and I wouldn't go there if I had 12 hours. I don't really care about cars though. ||||| Similar to the first comment on this, I recommend you to take the S-Bahn (thats the german name for this, and you will find the station in terminal 1 of the airport) to Marienplatz. (ca. 10-12 € and 45 min) Alternatively you could take a taxi (25 min and 50-60 €), or - if you are a member - a car sharing program. The latter is my favorite, as it offers the best cost benefit ratio (25 min 20-25 €).  There you will already find some of the most important attractions, and Viktualienmarkt is just 50 meters aways, as well es the biggest shopping streets in Munich if you would like to buy anything. Furthermore (and depending on the weather) I would recommend you to go to the Englischer Garten, which is just a 10 minute walk from Marienplatz, and a very nice place to spend your day (beer gardens, lakes, rivers, nature).  The BMW museum is great if you like cars, but if not, you will probably prefer other places first. 
3132	1,3,3,3	4	Hi all!   I have been EBF my 5 month old now for the past two months (prior to that we mix fed but we finally got there with the boob milk!), I am going back to work in September (he'll be 8 months old then) and I'm wondering realistically how much I should be expressing to build up a stash to give to his nursery when he starts there. I've not started weaning him yet so I know he'll be getting calories from food but he'll also need milk too and I have no clue how much he'll be on a day?  Currently I express only in the evening after I've put babasaur to bed and can get anywhere between 1 and 3.5 uk fl oz. The past few nights it's consistently been 3+. Should I be doing another pumping session too?   Fingers crossed it's only going to be for two months as I'm thinking of giving up work altogether to be with him until he's a bit older but the way my maternity pay works, I will owe them money if I don't go back for Sept/Oct.   I have more questions but brain splurge!  ||||| Here's the way I did it.  Before he started daycare, I pumped once a day, and built up a stash for 2 days. (My little guy usually eats 9 oz at his 9 hours at daycare.)  Once I went back to work, I pump at least enough at work to feed him the next day at daycare.  On Fridays, I put the pumped milk in the freezer, and on Monday, I pull the oldest milk out to send to daycare.  Luckily, I usually pump about 3oz more than he eats, so I'm slowly building up a stash so dad and I can go away for our anniversary.  (Although the stomach bug I had caused me to use up some of my freezer stash...) ||||| You are doing great! All of those 3 oz will add up quickly.

Anyway, if you don't get it, when you want to translate "just" use "acabo de" and the verb in infinitive. For example:  I just read a piece of news. Acabo de leer una noticia.  I just bought a pizza. Acabo de comprar una pizza. ||||| Acabo de ver tu mensaje. ||||| *Acabar* literally means 'to finish', so *acabar de* is used to talk about a past action that has just concluded. ||||| Of course "acabar de" is the most regular way to say it, but your attempt isn't wrong at all and it will be understdood by almost anyone in Latin America. Spaniards don't use the "justo" as in "acabar de".   If only, maybe the "yo", as it's usual in Spanish, is redundant and should be omitted. ||||| Would  Ahora vi tu mensaje   also work?

Now it's time to settle the subject of everyone's favorite repost - which shoes reign supreme.   Also we're doing this by brand because there are clearly too goddamn many different shoes for me to even come close to getting them all. So you can debate the individual shoes in the comments.  VOTE OR DIE MOTHA FUCKA: [URL] ||||| Merrell hiking shoes with Vibram Soles. Lightweight, comfy, and durable.  ||||| I wear Red Wing [4414's]([URL] they're heavy as fuck but I wear them at work so I'm used to it. ||||| The New Balance Clouds are great.  Though, I have to take what I can get with my Sasquatch feet.  ||||| Vibram five toes. I always get a ton of questions about them on the course. Yes, they're awesome and I've owned them for 4 years.       My motto has always been:          They're amazing as long as you're alright with looking like an asshole.  ||||| I love my Adidas Swifts. The goretex is awesome unless you have to go wading, then it takes forever to dry out, but I've had killer customer service through amazon. Got two pairs for the price of one when a stitch came out a day after my return was up. ||||| On muddy new england days i just wear my waterproof work boots they work amazing for everything except for off of the tee ||||| Shut up, none of you chuckleheads play barefoot. ||||| I voted for Nike because I prefer to wear Nike Frees. I tried a couple pairs of hiking shoes after wearing Frees for years and they only gave me problems with my feet and legs. The only problem I really have with Frees is they're not very cushioned, but the low sole is what gives me stability and confidence on my drives.  ||||| I currently use Montrails, but my last pair was Merrell, so I guess I'll vote that one? ||||| Voted Vibram since my North face are holding up really nice this year. ||||| Let it be known that you can return Merrells back to academy. I didn't believe it until a friend said "just walk up in there and ask for a new pair, you just need your drivers license."  Sure enough, I walked in holding my nasty ass worn out disc golf shoes and left with a brand new pair. No questions. He is on his 12th pair.   This is incredible if you have bad feet like me ||||| I wore some North Face Hedgehogs hiking shoes for a few years and they were perfect.  ||||| The Adidas Swift GTX are bad ass! ||||| I voted Merrell, but the real answer is "Whichever hiking shoes got destroyed last year by actual hiking." Right now it's a pair of Oboz Sawtooths that are missing half of the lugs on each foot. ||||| I wear Hi-Teks with Vibram soles. They have held up quite well in almost a year of use. ||||| Used to have Merrells. Recently upgraded to lat 64 t links.    Never going back!  ||||| Ive been playing in some Inov8 something or others lately and theyre working really well. Not waterproof, but theyre really comfortable and holding up well. ||||| Has anyone had the Adidas AX2 for 3+ months? I'm considering getting them but I was curious about their durability. ||||| I really like the Columbia Conspiracy III. They have out dry,  so super waterproof, and have a pretty firm sole. Great hiking shoes too. I've had them 2 years and just now are the soles falling apart.  Edit: Ventfreaks are good too ||||| Saucony TR9 Excursion.   For dry and hot weather, which is most of the year here.  ||||| I voted turd sandwich. ||||| Waterproof keen hiking boots are just the best. ||||| I wear Keen when it's soggy and Salient when it's nice out.
4623	1,3	5	So I did u dumbest thing. I deleted XBMC with Adbfire while KTV Launcher was frozen. Now I can't get pass the splash screen.  I did read up on how to Factory reset with keyboard but does this revert me back to the way the FTV came from the box or will it give me an updated unrootable firmware?  Also, any other suggestions for unbricking? Ideally I would like to keep all my apps and mods. ||||| If you can get it to reset with keyboard trick it should default to defaults of latest installed firmware, like you reset it.  If adb still works you could probably unfreeze or reflash your firmware using that rather than the keyboard recovery trick.   Next install rbox's recovery and use his xposed plugin so you never get yourself in this situation again.
6110	1,3,3	5	Hey guys, I was referred over here from /r/Frugal. I'm looking for a microphone for about $10 that can clearly record my voice. My budget is slightly flexible, so it doesn't have to be strictly $10. I would prefer something from Amazon because I have an Amazon Prime trial and a gift card there. Any recommendations would be awesome. ||||| You might honestly just want to use your phone at that point. Maybe pick something cheap off amazon.

8556	1,3,3,3	4	Hey /r/teenagers   We went away on tour last week, and in that time one of my mate's girlfriend got very coupley with another person on tour, as in spending the final 4 days consantly in each other's company. They were cuddling and flirting and she was wearing his hoodies.   I just don't know what to do about it. Do I tell him? I didn't see them do anything, but at one point they went into her room and the didn't have much on when they went in there and when we went in the were cuddling quite closely so who knows. Do I just leave it? I fear he'll be really angry if they break up and she tells everyone and I just really want advice what to do. ||||| see how she acts around him and then act accordingly is what I would do.   if she acts all super weird then tell him for sure. but if it goes back to the way it was and she'll never ever see this other dude again, then maybe just keep it on the dl.   I don't know her or your m8 so I have no idea what's the best course of action tbh  ||||| Well, if it was you in your mates shoes, would you want him to tell you? If someone is okay with pushing their loved ones out of their mind for another and then go back to how things were, it's not a good relationship to be in. Speaking from experience, if you're okay cheating on your significant other, you need to end the relationship. Maybe you should confront her before saying anything to him. Ask her if something happened, if she intends to tell him. ||||| they probably fucked

7652	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	10	[deleted] ||||| I think so. It probably won't be any worse than your current shoes if it does cause a problem. ||||| Personally, I'd rather get a bit of wear on them. Even if it's just walking around in them today, that'd make me happier going into a race. That said, I ran my last HM in shoes that I'd only run in once and wound up with a strong PR. I think you're better off with new shoes than beat up shoes. ||||| >But would I be alright running in brand new shoes, given that I've used the exact same style of shoe before?  "Maybe" is really the only answer anyone will be able to give you. ||||| New shoes can introduce new problems ranging from a raised seam to the difference in cushioning levels changing your impact. I'd stick with your old shoes. ||||| 550 km is not a lot of distance. My last pair of shoe lasted 4 months, or 1200 km. Basically, the upper part tore off partially and I had to use needle and thread to temporarily repair them until I had the time to buy new ones.  My advice is to use needle and thread to fill the holes in your old shoes, and run in those. Next time buy new shoes before wear and tear makes them look fugly. Running in brand new shoes often leads to injuries, especially on longer distances, like the half marathon. ||||| I forgot my shoes before a half marathon and had to buy a new pair the day before, same brand/model as the ones i trained in. I had one blister after the race but no other complaints. Maybe walk/jog a few miles in them beforehand, but you should be okay with a new pair. ||||| If its the same shoes you will probably be fine.  I had about 650km on my pair before my marathon I think my worn down shoes, longer distance than I should have run as well as possibly work boots led to getting plantar fasciitis.  I have read shoes can wear out any where between 300-400 miles, I am guilty of wearing shoes longer then I should (700-800+km)and usually my knee starts acting up or something when I wear them that much.    I think 600km I should have changed them actually in retrospect even earlier. There was a huge difference in the new shoe and the worn shoe when I changed them.  Most of my shoes look pretty new even with hundreds of km on them especially running in the winter so even if I am not busting out of them noticed the difference with the support immediately.  Another thing I read is that new shoes don't really need to be broken, I think it maybe preferred to have a few runs to conform the insole to your foot but it would be better to have a shoe with 50km or less on them than 550km was what one person said.       ||||| I'd avoid running long distance in new shoes.  ||||| I think you could probably pull it off. I don't think there is such a thing as breaking in shoes. I think it's the legs that need to adjust to the shoe. For example, your legs and feet are used to landing the same way on every step with these beaten shoes so new shoes your feet will land slightly differently and your legs will respond slightly different. It's kind of late for this time, but I think doing ankle stretches and lunges and whatnot and rotating shoes and surfaces can help keep legs more (I don't know the right word) diverse, adaptable, and multi-dimensional instead of just being good at running one way.

7195	1,3,3	3	Any help choosing team members and how I should go about making a good competitive team would be greatly appreciated. ||||| I definitely recommend using pokemonshowdown.com to build and test your team.   (Just in case you didn't know about it.)   Look up videos of competitive battling  (from people like shofu and verilisify) and look at their techniques. Smogon University also has recommended builds for pokemon (which you should take with a grain of salt, you don't HAVE to stay within the formula, most battlers certainly don't).    ||||| Well, a good team needs to be balanced, and needs to have answers to common threats if it wants to be successful. A good starting point could be choosing a Pokémon or two you want to use and building around them to cover weaknesses and provide support, or you could start with a core. A core is basically 2 or 3 mons that compliment each other by covering weaknesses and having good synergy. There are two kinds; defensive cores and offensive cores.  Defensive cores are composed of bulky Pokémon with support and defense in mind. It's best to have Pokémon with high defense and others with high Special defense. An example of a defensive would be Skarmory and Blissey- Skarmory takes the physical hits and Blissey sponges the special hits. This is also good because Blissey can heal the team's status problems with Aromatherapy and Skarmory can phase out setup sweepers with Whirlwind and lay Spikes, and both can heal themselves with Softboiled and Roost, respectively. So they're both ery good Pokémon on their own. This may be a very generic example because of the extremely lopsided nature of both Pokémon, but it's a good starting point.  An offensive core is focused on keeping momentum in your favor and breaking trough the enemy's counters. A good example is Gyarados and Jolteon. Jolteon switches in to take the electric type attacks aimed at Gyarados, and gets 25% of its health back with Volt Absorb. Alternatively, Gyarados can switch in on ground type attacks aimed at Jolteon, and is immune to them because it's a part flying type. These two compliment each other well, since Jolteon has high special attack and Gyarados has high attack.  The rest of the team can be used to offer support, such as a Ferrothorn laying Spikes or Stealth Rocks, or spreading status with Thunder Wave and Leech Seed. Maybe you want a mixed attacker, such as Infernape or Hydreigon, to break down walls. Maybe Talonflame poses a big threat to your team, so you use a Rotom-Wash to counter it. Maybe you want a lategame cleaner, so you pick up a Shell Smash Cloyster. Rapid Spin is important, so you might want an Excadrill or a Tentacruel.  It's really all about trying a team, making adjustments, seeing what works, and getting a feel for how the metagame works. You can look up individual analysis entries for each Pokémon on Smogon, as well as tier lists, ban lists, etc. At the beginning, it might not hurt to use their recommended sets, but as time goes on you can use your own sets. I wish you good luck and hope you have fun playing Pokémon; it's really a great community, and I know it can be intimidating, but everyone has to be a beginner at some point. If you were looking for some other info, I'd be willing to help in whatever way I can.
3367	1,3,2,3,2	22	I'm being kicked out on Jan 1st (can't be kicked out on a holiday, so maybe he 2nd, laws and shit) and I can't fucking find a place. It's either weird people, too much, or too far.

8838	1,3,3,3	9	Hi everyone, I'm running a Cleric and I'm currently Cleric 2, Priest 1.  I'm aiming for a gvg support Cleric and I think that it won't differ much from a pve support Cleric.   I have 6 questions:   1) What do I max between Heal and Safety Zone? I'd go with Safety zone because I think it's more useful in a gvg scenario.   2) Is Krivis skill Daino actually useful? Is it worth maxing it?   3) Here's my current build: [URL] How would you continue it? I came up with this build but I'd like your opinions: [URL]   4) Is Sacrament counterable? I played ragnarok and there you could enchant your armor with holy property. Is there something similiar? From what I know it's not possible but I'm not sure.   5) Fumigate description says: "Applies a maximum of N times". Does it removes N status alignment from each target?   6) Is Bloodletting worth maxing? I think that the HP reduction isn't noticeable at higher levels but I might be wrong.  Thank you in advance :) ||||| 2) Yes it's very useful. Some classes have 5 buff slots limit, some 7 buff slots limit. +1 for token, +1 for rank 5. And whopping +6 for Daino. You can use scrolls for daino, but it will cost you around 50k silver per hour.  3) Well it's nice support build, but i think it's impossible to level up solo with it.  Here's mine, for solo / group play : [URL]  4) Holy property is the only property in game that has no resistance on mobs. Players can get holy resistance as an enchant on hair items though.   5) Rank 1 is enough.  6) No, rank 1 is enough too.  ||||| [deleted] ||||| 1. Max heal and Safety Zone. Its the best spell for support until end-game.  2. Daino is worth to max due to how Buff Limit works.  3. So far its good. Max Heal since number of tiles spawns equals to skill level. You don't need to Fumigate that much. Level 1 is fine really.  Only known Rank 3 debuff is Incineration which is only for PvP by far.  4.No, Sacrament adds additional hit count and additional damage, and its Magic-based damage. In this game, Magic cant miss/blocked. There is no such thing as "Enchant armor with x property" yet as far as I know.  5. I'm yet to test how Fumigate "Applies x times" works. Its most likely how many debuffs it can remove on target/area.  6. Maxed Bloodletting can have 100% uptime when paired with Divine Might. This goes the same with Healing Factor. So its up to you.

6245	1,3	4	I suddenly started to have a great interest in Steampunk culture and want to dress more formal, like shirts, vests, suits and maybe ties. But still I don't want to look like a butler or a businessman also I don't want to melt with a vest and shirt in summer.  As an example, I found this vest, it is cheap, 30 bucks, and looks really great. Black: [URL] Blue: [URL]  Also plan to buy colorful shirts like this (Of course with shorter sleeves if it is too hot): [URL]  Also I have a hat like this and I really like it and I want to spice my style with hats like this: [URL]  What do you suggest? I will also wear some Steampunk accesories like a cog necklace or bracelet and stuff like that. ||||| You honestly feel like a troll, bt against by best judgement I'll try to help.   1: [This guy]([URL] seems to have the look you're after, and it's terrible. Do you really want to look like that? If yes, then continue your plans, and only buy cheap as shit clothing until you grow out of it. If not, then continue.   2: Vests are tacky. The vests you linked are even more tacky then normal vests. They look like cardigans but with the sleeves chopped off. The shirts you linked are even worse. Bright shiny red shirts with a black tacky vest will not look good. It will also not look steam punk. It will also look as far away from formal as you could possibly get. A vest with a short sleve shirt will look so bad i'd think people will take photos of you to post to /r/cringe. The hat is also so very away from "classy." I don't really think there is a classy fashinable hat anymore, that isn't hugely expensive.   3: So, what should you do? Well, steampunk inspired (never go full steampunk) isn't very summer friendly. Maybe pick up some solid black leather dessert or chukka boots, some dark colored chinos (olive, black, dark navy or maybe brown) and some plain solid colored OCBD'S, with either long sleeved rolled up, or short sleeves. This look is not 100% formal, but would be acepted as in most places/ businesses. To keep it more steam punk inspired, the colours of the shirts could be more out there if you really wish. Stay far away from vests. Maybe a light leather, or leather look jacket would make it more steam punky, but you'd be hot. Also get a dark pea coat for winter. They are quite steampunkesq, and look sweet. Hopefully that helps.

7862	1,3,3,3	12	Especialy with my voice, it sounds very 'uncomfortable' and thick. Oh btw I'm a guy and I'm 20 years old, identified as 'low'  baritone but I try to ignore my range limits.  [URL] Yes that's me but I cant seem to get my tone very smooth. It stays in this thick way troughout my whole range.  ||||| Volume control is merely how much air you push through.   What do you mean by thick? As in the character of your voice? It's sound pretty light to me.  It's sounds pretty uncomfortable because it's edging on using falsetto co-ordination (Breathy) and sounds like you haven't got enough support.  I'm a low baritone such as yourself, but you're lightening your voice too early I'd think, which puts things out of whack. You have to make sure that your larynx doesn't shoot up to reach higher notes otherwise you'll strain.   Here is me trying you emulate your recording: [URL]  And here is how'd I try to sing it: [URL]  Can you hear the tonal differences in both recordings? I'm hitting the same notes by keeping an open palate (back of my mouth), placing my voice at the roof of my mouth, and keeping the larynx controlled, you can hit the notes with ease.  Is there anything else you need to ask? ||||| Your voice sounds quite light actually. ||||| You're not singing too thickly. The main problem I hear from you is that you aren't familiar with the center of your voice - the volume and tone it works most efficiently in - and that's throwing your entire voice off. You need to be able to sing at a medium loud volume with a clear tone first - you have to be intimately familiar with that "center" volume and tone of your voice, before you can control and vary it effectively. In this file you're only singing at a medium soft volume and it's too breathy. You are already "off center" in two areas so if this is your default singing voice everything will be hard to control.  I'm a baritone and here's a example of roughly how my voice sounds when I'm singing in the "center" of it. The verses are pretty dead on in the center here, the choruses are fairly close too. [URL] That kind of intensity and clarity and balanced tone is the same voice you would start doing vocal exercises in, building your fundamentals etc.  Most pro singers hang around the the center of their voice too, though a great many don't (usually by choice not by weakness), so you have to be careful who you imitate.  If you're really interested in sorting your struggles out once and for all I'd be happy to give you a free skype lesson to guide you through all of this so you're not just reading words but directly experiencing positive changes in your voice and learning how to control your volume very well

3464	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	12	I am particularly nervous for the Fall semester; I want to do everything I can in my power to prepare early for classes in fall. I am asking this now because I know had a poor work ethic in my junior year of highschool (when everything went to hell for me, I still can't quite recall what happened...very simply I lost momentum) so I'd like to mentally prepare myself for the classes so I don't get any surprises.   I took Honors Chemistry in high school and made a low B (the class average was a B since the teacher was particularly challenging--she made up her own tests and loved chemistry and was a chem major) and I was wondering if this would prepare me for college chem? I have some of the notes/worksheets that I was given in the class. Also, I have been hearing a lot of College Freshman wishing that they took Intro to Chem before going head first into Chem during their transfer program so this made me really nervous.   I don't love chemistry enough to get a degree in it, but I liked balancing the equations in class. The in-class labs were also fun (we had plenty of those so it helped me to understand some topics in other sciences, i.e. photosynthesis and cellular respiration). However given the reputation that the classes have had I would relaly like to prepare as much as I can for the upcoming Fall and subsequent semesters.   What has helped you the most in studying for these classes?  Any tips/hints/tricks?  If I studied day and night with no breaks and no fun time would I have a better chance?  What are your ideas about flashcards?   Thank you for taking the time to read and answer. :) ||||| General chemistry and organic chemistry are complete opposites. General chemistry is often called physical chemistry on training wheels. I found organic very challenging initially. I worked my ass off, and one day it just clicked for me, and I couldn't get enough of it. I realized that, unlike gen chem, one could not rely on memorization. It's all about pattern recognition--which is only developed by working problem after problem after problem. I loved the fact that you could be given a problem you have never seen before, and yet, by following a few rules, and relying on your intuition, you could arrive at the answer.   The moral of the story is this: just because you didn't like gen chem, or didn't excel in gen chem will not influence how well you will do in organic.   Just be willing to work hard, and NEVER get behind.  ||||| After my first year at University doing Chemistry, I found that ideally you shouldn't need to memorise anything really, if you understand WHY a chemical behaves how it does then exam answers will come easily to you. I would agree that writing out notes  in full for topics is important, and physics/physical chemistry understanding is vital to success, especially with regards to molecular orbital theory. YouTube, in fact, has some great explanations about the topics and I couldn't recommend the channel readysetorgo too! ||||| Get you head around what a electrophile is and what a nucleophile is... Organic chemistry is just knowning where your electrons are and where they're likely to go when a molcule interacts with another or parts of itself. ||||| It depends what kind of person you are. Organic Chemistry is certainly going to be a lot different from the chemistry you've learned in high school. Organic 1 is mostly learning reaction mechanics (how a reaction between two species actually follows through) and properties of reagents (relative size, pH, solubility, polarity, etc) that will determine which kinds of reactions they can be used for. You should also be prepared to memorize some famous reactions (the reactants, solvent, catalysts, and products).  Study Tips: Complete the book's problem sets. and notecards. tons and tons of notecards. ||||| The class "inorganic chemistry" is really quite easy compared to general chemistry, I found. It's basically just going more in depth in a few topics covered in general chemistry. So long as you complete problem sets and ask the professor about anything you don't understand, you should be fine! ||||| Inorganic was like a physics class for me.  There were quite a few formulas we had to learn to prove and concepts that applied to chemistry (Coulomb's Law for example).  Organic was easy for me but still a bit of work.  The application of molecular orbital theory and quantum mechanics was a bit difficult but learning reactions is relatively easy to pick up on if you learn to figure out the patterns and not do the pre-med method of studying:  simply memorizing.  Organic was finding the relative charges and learning what molecule goes to what.  Find the nucleophile, find the electrophile, and find any sort of resonance that might happen. (Once you learn your first mechanism  Physics is what made me study better because of the difficult nature.  The concepts were easy, but the problem solving was difficult to me and I had the drive to learn. Figuring I had a stronger chemistry background because of high school, the concepts were already understood but problems and learning new things became a challenge. What made me learn better was active learning.  Don't read the book like a novel.  It's slow, boring, and a waste. Browse through the section and try to understand what the entire goal of the section is.  After that, break each section down and write/type the section down to your own understanding.  If there's a large paragraph, break it down to delete any unnecessary words.  While doing this, it wouldn't hurt to ask some of your own questions (why? when? where? what? Any exceptions to this?)  After each section, do some practice problems.    Teach someone else.  I wish I would've done more of this in my earlier years.  I do this in O Chem by helping out people because I understand the concepts better (but yet I still get shittier grades than them) and it helps reinforce my learning.  This is all a learning process.  I'm a late bloomer in learning HOW to learn because I'm smart and I have very bad study habits so I thought I'd pass this on to you.  I would say it's a combination of working smart and hard.  Mostly hard, because if you work smart, it will drive you to work hard. ||||| I go to a CCC as well (Cabrillo) and inorganic chemistry (1A) is not as hard as people make it out to be. Sure if you you're lazy then it could be quite challenging but if you put a good amount of effort in the class then you will be pleasantly surprised by the results.  The best way to succeed is to not focus on memorization and instead try and understand the underlying principles on how chemistry works. Don't worry about the grade, just be as curious as possible and do every practice problem and the grade will come naturally. Good luck!

2896	1,3,3,3	10	Hello /r/bicycling.  Just joined a few weeks back after purchasing my new ride.  I am just curious if the more gearhead oriented in the pack can point me in the right direction of learning to take care of my bicycle after a ride, and maybe some light maintenance instructions.  Having invested the money, I really really want to keep her in top shape. Best purchase EVER, I might add. ||||| Welcome.  [Here you go.]([URL]  That site belongs to the late, great Sheldon Brown, who will teach you just about everything you could ever want to know about maintaining your bike. ||||| Buy a bottle of good chain lube (NOT 3-in-one oil or WD-40, get a bicycle-specific chain lube). Get in the good habit of keeping that chain tip-top. If it is making any kind of noise you've waited far too long. Soak (not literally, I guess. but you get the idea) the chain and wipe every single last drop that you possible can off of the chain. I dedicate an old T-shirt for this. Anywhere the t-shirt can touch does not need lube and will just attract grit.  Tire pressure is a big one, too. Your tires will last longer and you can go faster if you keep them pumped up near the upper limit (especially on tarmac. If in the mtns, make sure its appropriate for the trail).    You can save yourself a lot of money and, more importantly, time if you learn to make the little brake and derailleur adjustments yourself. Make sure to double check your safety items (hell, double check everything and triple check the safety items) like brakes, skewers, tires. Actually, on a bike pretty much everything is a safety item.    Ride it all the time. Let the paint get scratched. A good indicator of a well kept bike is one that doesn't make a peep while being ridden. Make sure your wheels stay true and (especially if its a mtn bike) periodically check the spoke tension. If the bike is brand spankin new, check them now so you have a good idea of what a good tension is. The bike shop will help you with this one too.  You're about to be even more stoked than you are today  ||||| If you want it to stay in tip-top shame, let the pros handle the big stuff. You're goal should be to keep the tires inflated, and keep the bike clean and lubricated. If it stops shifting correctly, or the wheels get to bad out of true, take it to the shop and let them handle it. Don't go out of your way attempting to fix things if you're uncomfortable doing it. Sure there are plenty of guides online on how to do these things, but again let the pros handle it. 
8828	1,3	5	Hey.  Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this.  Basically, I'm contemplating buying a Groupon travel to Australia, but see precious few reviews on the agency organizing it.  So I wondered if Reddit may know and guessed that there's probably an /r/travel.  I looked on the side bar and this may qualify as an ad (?), so let me know if this is out of place.  Basically, I'm looking at [URL] and was wondering if anyone had any experience with Down Under Answers as a travel agency.  I'd really like to go to Australia and this seems like a really cheap way to stay in some really nice places while there.  Thanks. ||||| Well I'm a travel agent here in Aus and I've never heard of them... Must be a foreign only agency? Considering their testimonials page links to their FAQ and the fact that their website looks a bit dodgy anyway I'd have to say I wouldn't trust them with large sums of money. They also don't appear to be IATA registered and that's a fairly huge red flag for a travel agency.

9400	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	20	The highest card i can get is a Legendary, is this the same for people in SR tier? if so, shouldnt there be some sort of adjustment for people in different tiers? getting an Epic and Leg just for logging in at that level seems a bit unfair  ||||| It's a way for people who haven't been playing from the start to advance quicker so they don't lose interest in the game.  For the game to survive, it doesn't just need returning players, it needs new players to grow.   Who cares if new players get a Legendary in 24 days? It has zero effect on most of us.  And hey, free fusion food. ||||| As far as Im aware, its the same for everyone.   I do agree it should be somewhat tier based, as you said someone starting new can quite easily get a Leg with little effort ||||| It took me 4 months to get a legendary card (what was a freebie) and people can log in for 24 days and get a good Legendary card. It's stupid . it should be tier based if  you are in epic tier , **you should only be able to get a epic card**. You will have people who have only played 100 matches with a legendary card. :/ ||||| Im in WM tier and its a Legendary Bryan .. the rewards are good fusion fodder .. as for just getting a Legendary for just signing in i feel its fair.. i want people to have it easier to start so they arnt discouraged .. Most games now make it easier to get new players in.. What was hard for you doesnt need to stay that way . you still have an advantage over new players. between all the events and the free credits you have revived . I just wish the reward went up to WM but make it  so you have to sign in every day for 3 months .     ||||| Yeah for your question, but let's be honest, it isn't really hard for new people to get to legendary in less than 20 days due to fusions mainly. ||||| People complain about people being able to 'do nothing' for 24 days and get  a legendary?  So what? It's gonna take them 5 months to get a full legendary deck...which will only get then to Leg++  And before that the leg is going to make their deck so unbalanced it will be detrimental for them to use it. ||||| Meh, the only good a Legendary Card is for me is fusion food or training.

8278	1,3,3,3,2,3	7	So now with everyone having Lapis, I was wondering what would be better for TOA? I just 5 starred a Tyron, but having basic attack AOE despair on Lapis is pretty nice. Any thoughts on which I should work on first? ||||| Build that Tyron of yours. He is not just for ToA. And that blue tomboy might get a nerf for that AoE despair every turn, "might".  That 100% chance to freeze pre-accuracy/resistance check is still 100000% more reliable than that slow lady's every turn AoE despair. ||||| It's still pretty soon to talk about Lapis but let's compare their skills from an AoE, stun, base dmg and cd perspective for ToA:    1. Lapis has 1 less cd on 3rd and 2nd skill. His second skill AoE disturbs hp recovery but it's not 100% and it's random, while tyron it's full AoE. For ToA floor where I need HP disturb I would rather use briand.  2. When talking about despair procs and stuns I think tyron might be better (unless you have crazy speed on lapis), since both of his AoE full area and his third skill is a 100% freeze (before resistnce), from my experience, using tyron+baretta+vero is almost 2-3 or even 4 stunned turns on 3-4 man or full enemie team. 3. Better multipliers on lapis but overall more utility on tyron. If you want a DD you might better consider sigmarus (who even has AoE and can freeze in att build) or another one, lapis att base is pretty low.  4. Tyron leader skill is awesome everywhere, and in general, you can still farm with tyron with his despair/focus build. Yes, 24% att boost from lapis is ok, but not that much when you need healers/veromos/baretta/rezzers on high floors of ToA.  I feel lapis cries for despair set, but he don't have as much utility as tyron may give you. But again, I'm only theoryzing, too soon to judge a 1 day born mons.      ||||| Tyron ffs. I want him badly :( ||||| so for those of us without tyron, lapis a good poor mans sub?   Im running Baretta, Lapis/okenos, Shannon, bernard, chasun/ahman right now. (have julien also, but lineup already feels wind heavy)  making changes when needed for elements and adding in kona when i need to clear de-buffs or bombs (vero close to completion)  I max out around floor 70 right now, but i think thats more of a rune issue ||||| Tyron for sure. You guys are overestimating Lapis and the rune effect Despair. (Despair is only 25% and it's not per hit, you only stun enemy 25% even if u hit him 5 times.) Lapis do ok damage, but her skills are useless. (second skill does 4 hits on low hp target, damage wise it's ok, unrecoverable debuff is ok) (Third skill only heal herself, there's no harmful effects on enemy)  Tyron has 2 aoe. Third skill freeze for 100%. For her second skill, do not underestimate glacing hit, it is just as good as atk debuff (glacing hit also prevent harmful effects from activating, so it's even better than atk debuff). and her first skill can put out amazing damage.
2044	1,1,0,0,0	20	Add slow back to ultimate ||||| I'd be fine with this. For the most part though it wont make him any more relevant in competitive play. He is still the single best Assault god and decent in Joust (though the old Joust map was way better for him) ||||| I want to support this. But I don't think that's necessarily the buff he needs. At least not to the point where it was (where it continually stacked per wraith, that was bonkers). Especially since you can buy Gem of Isolation to outright give the ultimate a slow again. If anything should happen to his ultimate, it's that it shouldn't go away when he dies. That was probably the absolute dumbest nerf I've ever heard. ||||| You guys just don't understand that all the gods without movement abilities, Kuku, Anubis, Ah Puch, He Bo, are NEVER going to be relevant (without buffing them past the breaking point) because they're squishy mages who can't run away.   The only way to make them "relevant" is to add movement to their kit because movement abilities are king in this game.  ||||| Ah Puch is fine as is. He is doing decent atm.  He is about A tier, that is where gods belong. A tier gods are not the problem.  Stop trying to buff shit because you like the god. Certain gods are just better in the meta than others, thats how the game works, not every god needs a buff just because they arent in the meta.  
4021	1,2,3,3,3,2,2,3	23	Howdy folks! I didn't know where else to turn to ask a question like this because it's not so much a question as it is needing advice.   For the past couple of weeks my 9 y/o Wheaten Terrier Scooby has been acting strange but only at night. And only sometimes.   He's always thought he was a lap dog but this is a whole new level of clingy and sitting on us.   I will be lying in bed and he will jump up on the bed and stand over me for a minute and then lay down right next to me, almost on top of me. Not the "a[URL] buddy" kind of lying down, no this is annoying because he's pushing me while lying next to me.   And then he will lay on top of me. In an uncomfortable manner. Almost like he's scared of something. Then to top it all off he will randomly bolt upright. Just all of a sudden will be sitting up looking towards the door when there is nothing there.   I'll take him off the bed and he won't get down, and when he does he will kind of stand there with his tail down. He pants really heavily during most of this. And sometimes we will repeat the cycle because he will jump right back up.    Can anyone help me out here? Do I need to see a dog psychiatrist? Do those exist?   I love my furry friend and I'm worried.  Edit: something I forgot to mention is that this has been going on occasionally for about two weeks and he was panting heavily before this at night so I don't think the panting is relevant.   Edit 2: I'm not home yet to try any of your tips but I just wanted to thank you all for your concern and care and great suggestions. Scooby has an appointment for the vet on Friday.   Also here he is in case anyone was curious! [URL] [URL] [URL]  Edit: 2 years later edit in case anyone stumbles on this. He's fine now, we think there was something wrong with the AC/heat that was freaking him out. A noise or something. We're still not entirely sure but it's never happened again.  ||||| When was the last time he was at the vet? Have you gotten his hearing/eyesight checked?  Doesn't really sound like a breed specific problem, it just sounds like maybe something is developing or changing on the health front that may make him feel more comfortable aggressively pushing against you. It is not unusual for aging dogs to do that. ||||| I would suggest a vet, he could well have a medical issue that's causing anxiety.  ||||| There are dog behaviorists, but I want you to try something--check the batteries in your smoke detectors, or replace them all.  I had a similar issue with my dog and I was crying one night bc I couldn't figure it out and thought he must be really sick or have something wrong.   The problem? A smoke detector beeping occasionally. He'd shake and pant and have his tail between his legs. I'd seen him like that when one went off, but didn't make the connection because I couldn't hear the intermittent beeping. I think he could hear it more at night too, bc other day sounds weren't drowning it out. I replaced a battery and he was fine. Worth a shot.  Edit/addition: If you're in an apartment building, it could also be a neighbor's smoke detector or one in a vacant apt., or even something else that makes high pitched sounds that aren't as obvious to human ears.  ||||| My parent's wheaten has been an anxious, clingy little bugger her whole life.  Her more spastic episodes generally come with quite a bit of panting.  [Getting her a thundershirt]([URL] helped quite a bit for situations we know she gets worked up about--travel, visitors, squirrels in her line of vision, squirrels outside of her line of vision, that sort of stuff.  Hopefully it's nothing serious.  But, following up with the vet definitely sounds prudent.     ||||| Are you having strange weather? My dog is likely part Wheaton, and he gets very anxious at night when we're about to get a snowstorm or thunderstorm. I have a feeling he can somehow since the change in barometric pressure. ||||| Is he having a vision problem?

Upvote your favorites! ||||| Here's a nice tutorial: [URL]  I did a poop ton of curves for a Desert Bus quilt [click!]([URL] The biggest thing is to just make sure you go slowly, and don't be afraid to make the pieces slightly oversized to allow you to trim back your mistakes. Also, make sure you use a middle-weight fabric, and don't starch it before you sew. This is one of those times you definitely want to make sure that you can fiddle with the stretch of the fabric. ||||| This is a good one using the Curve Master foot:  [URL] ||||| Just a general note on curves seeing how the last quilt I did was TWELVE CIRCLES OF HELL:   Pin. pin pin pin pin pin. Pin more. Pin a ton more. Stick those pins all over the place.   At least to start with, that is. Easing seams can be interesting when you're not used to it. Having the fabric stay put when you start lets you get the hang of it, the feel of it, as you sew. By the time I was done I got really fast at sewing them but man, ugh, I'm done for a bit.   On the plus side, once you've done a bunch of curves drunkard's path is dream :)  ||||| [URL]  I used a compass fitted with the disappearing fabric ink pen and drew my quarter circle instead of using a template because I wanted a larger block.

2375	1,3,3	4	**Artist:** Television   **Album:** Marquee Moon   **Genre:** Punk rock   **Length:** 45 minutes   **Release Date:** 8 February, 1977   -----------------------------------------------------------------   Leading figures in the New York music scene, Television is the quintessential “way-before-it’s-time” band. Garnering notoriety for their unconventional take on punk rock – which, at the time, was incredibly popular thanks to The Clash and Sex Pistols, to name a few artists – they released their debut album **Marquee Moon** in 1977 to a widely positive response. Critics acclaimed it for its ambition and peculiar style; a style which would eventually influence bands such as The Strokes, R.E.M., Joy Division, and U2, to name just a handful.  The majority of the tracks on here are fairly short, guitar-driven songs that rely on catchy hooks to draw the listener in immediately. The title track, however, is longer and more jam-oriented. Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd supply the album’s guitars, the rhythms and melodies of which wonderfully interplay throughout, fitting together akin to a jigsaw puzzle.   Lyrically, there’s not much I really got out of **Marquee Moon** in my first listen. That’s not to say there’s nothing to get, and after going back through the album and focusing more on them – something I inadvertently eschewed in favor of my transfixion with the tight, intricate guitar work – I’ve realized just how neat they really are. From *Marquee Moon* (the title track): “I remember how the darkness doubled/I recall, lightning struck itself/I was listening, listening to the rain/I was hearing, hearing something else.” This lyrics resonated with me a lot for some reason, I’m really not sure why but I know I like it. My suggestion to first-time listeners – or even returning listeners who haven’t focused too primarily on the album’s lyrics – listen to them. They may inspire and amaze you as much as the rest of the music most likely has.   Without a doubt, **Marquee Moon** is a musical revolution. Its brand of punk rock – one which may not raise too many eyebrows in 2013 – is absolutely astonishing considering the fact that, at the time of its release, there was nothing out there similar to it. While the influence of the Velvet Underground is notable, the avant-garde and blues touches featured in their music are completely stripped away and instead, we’re left with a very raw, tense, and emotive garage rock album that has changed rock music forever.    ------------------------------------------------------------------   [Additional review]([URL]   [Youtube video]([URL] - See No Evil   [Grooveshark playlist]([URL] )   [Album download (physical and digital)]([URL] ||||| Alan Cross gives some great insight to this band and their relation to CBGB on his radio program [The Ongoing History of New Music]([URL] (Warning: I didn't test that torrent so be careful).

2736	1,3,3	23	Hello guys! I'm currently new at mixing and editing vocals and my problem is that I don't know which is the best way to add effects to your vocal track.  I have Pro Tools, but I'm currently using Mixcraft because it's a lot easier in my opinion, for beginners. When adding effects, I just use the 'effects rack' on the track settings and add effects there. But sometimes, my vocals would become to 'bulky' or like its really loud and it doesn't sound that natural enough... I heard that professional audio producers uses plugin chain in pro tools like sending/buses and stuffs like-creating separate aux tracks, putting the effects there, and sending your vocal track to that aux track... which is kind of difficult for me.  What do you guys suggest? Which would sound better?  BTW I'm using eq, compression, de-esser, etc... basic effects and all... Thanks! ||||| As a rule, dynamic processors, like compressors and expanders, go on the inserts on the tracks (you want your entire signal to pass through them, which is what the inserts are basically for). Same with equalizers.  Effects, like reverb, chorus, flanger, that you want to basically blend together with the dry signal, go on auxiliary tracks, and you use sends on your individual tracks to send audio from the tracks to the effect auxes.  Using effects auxes is much more flexible, resource-friendly, and maintainable than slapping *everything* on the inserts. However, if you're only using EQ and dynamics processing, putting them on the inserts on the tracks themselves, is fine.  Edit: added some words ||||| Different engineers will have different preferences to the order of eq/dynamics but I think everyone would agree that melodyne should go first. That way you any processing after is to the properly pitched signal. I sometimes like to use two EQs, one pre compression for cuts and one after for boosts. So I would say a good chain would be Melodyne->EQ->Compression . You're delays and reverbs can live on separate aux tracks that you send to from your vocal audio track. These auxes will most likely be receiving the signal after the compression.  
587	1,3,3,3,3,3	12	Other than the ordinarily brushing my teeth, flossing regularly, and using mouthwash. Are there any tips and tricks that any redditor can do in order to help get that pearly white smile? ||||| Wear yellow shirts! ||||| Semen. ||||| Orthodontic resident here, and Founder of MorethanSmiles.org  There are numerous means of whitening your teeth, but your goal should be to whiten your teeth in a sustainable fashion. To do this, there are a couple key principles you'll want to follow (I'll get into some treatment options for you down the page):  - **Limit the frequency you whiten your teeth**. Frequent whitening strips your enamel of the protective protein skin called the pellicle, which helps make your teeth more resistant to acids. Ironically, although this layer is protective this is the predominant area where stains like to embed. All bleaching procedures will affect the pellicle and you want to allow your teeth to recover between treatments instead of constantly eliminating your body's natural protective mechanisms  - **Choose whitening treatments that provide the best Color Stability**. This goes hand in hand with our first principle. The longer the whitening remains the less often you need to whiten. This means that you want a procedure that produces the most dramatic whitening in a short period of time (you are further from your baseline color), and one that is also produces very stable color changes. This usually means using a treatment offered through your dentist (i.e. tray whitening, in-office treatments), although Crest White Strips can produce decent color stability as well.  - **Avoid at all costs whitening therapies that are erosive or abrasive to your teeth**. This means absolutely no whitening rinses and no whitening toothpastes. Whitening rinses contain citric acids/citrates which are very erosive (because citric acid chelates calcium) to try and peal back the pellicle and also some of your enamel as well. The hydrogen peroxide you get at the store are also very acidic because it increases shelf life, so using this is a bad idea. Whitening toothpastes rely on heavy abrasives to abrade off your enamel pellicle, and this usually does more harm than good to your teeth when used as a daily toothpaste.  - **Modifying your diet to limit acids during active whitening periods**. If you do a one step in-office whitening this really only applies to the first day or two after whitening, but this is more important if you are in the middle of two weeks of using Crest White Strips. Bleaching therapies of all kinds lift the pellicle off your teeth, so you need to recognize they will be more vulnerable to acids during this time.  **Here are in my opinion your best options for whitening according to the above principles**:  1. **In-Office Dental Whitenings**. Best Color Stability, One Treatment, and your dentist can help you manage negative side effects to your teeth.  2. **Tray Whitening**. These offer great color stability (up to 18months in many cases), Reduced Treatment Window. It works best when the whitening agent is alkaline (Rembrandt usually is alkaline), but it is tough with the slew of new products to know which ones are the most alkaline or pH balanced, so do not exceed the recommended treatment time. Go with one that doesn't require overnight wear (most of the whitening agent is no longer active after 30 min anyway).  3. **Crest White Strips**. Decent Color Stability (roughly 2-6 months), No Abrasion, Only mildly acidic (~5.6 pH) and no citric acid. Make sure you take at least 1-2 months off between treatment cycles (14 days). Do not brush your teeth after whitening for a minimum of 30 minutes afterwards - Abrasion following acidic events is not good. Ideally, you should brush right before whitening. Use a pH re-balancing rinse (recipe - [URL] or a fairly pH balanced fluoride rinse like ACT Restore immediately following whitening treatments.  Side Notes:  - Rinsing with water after consuming staining foods/drinks like coffee or tea has not been shown to make a significant difference in stain reduction, although it definitely can't hurt if it makes you feel good. The thought behind doing this would be to flush out staining products from areas with lower salivary clearance such as the visibile surfaces of your front teeth. If you are going to do this, I would do it immediately after any sip of coffee, but this can be a huge pain.   - Do not go and start brushing your teeth immediately following consumption of foods/drinks that might stain your teeth thinking you are preventing stains. Right after eating (especially right after highly acidic drinks or food) your teeth are at their softest because of acids produced from sugars by bacteria and sometimes from acids in the foods themselves. Combining acids and abrasion (from brushing) will damage your teeth. Normal oral hygiene, will do plenty of good against staining so there is no need to get compulsive and brush immediately following meals.  - Smoking has a synergistic effect on staining from foods and drinks.  - If you love coffee as much as I do, you'll get a lot of staining. I put together a really cool series of posts on coffee and tooth stains that everyone might find cool. I don't sell crap on my blog and I have no affiliations with any companies; I am just sick of content farms propagating misinformation so this is why I share so I hope you don't get offended by my link.

If anyone has questions or ways for me to be more clear with my answer leave a comment and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. ||||| Not a dentist, but I fairly have white teeth. I honestly hate using Colgate toothpaste because it does nothing, but give a bad breath. What I do use is Oral B toothbrush (about $4) with Crest whitening deep clean tooth paste (about $3-5). I brush for 4-6 minutes to get that fresh breath and white teeth.   If that doesn't give you the right results, I'd recommend using crest whitening strips. They will be a bit pricey, about $50 but it will work. Your teeth might get sensitive to it.  ||||| My cousin is a dentist, and she said she recommends the Rembrandt 2-hour kit thingie.

3167	1,3	6	Could have Joss Whedon called her Cordelia in order to evoke some sort of King Lear aspect?  Perhaps that Cordelia, in King Lear, in the beginning seems to be the opposite of Cordelia in Buffy.  Or maybe Cordelia always says what is on people's minds, but unlike Cordelia in King Lear, she doesn't say anything in the beginning? ||||| In Buffy I wouldn't say there is too much comparison. Cordelia in King Lear is not self centered and is kind and loving. True, they share the same outspokenness and brutal honesty, but she is sweet and devoted. She doesn't say the brutal honesty to be cruel, but because it's right. Cordi sometimes does in Buffy, but most of the time it's motivated from just pure self righteousness and being mean.   In Angel however, I would agree that there are parallels. Both share much compassion and you could kind of see the similarities between Kind Lear and Cordelia, and Angel and Cordelia. Although Angelus tried to kill her and not banish her (In Buffy, not Angel). Cordelia forgave him and in some respects, she pays for price for Angel/Angelus's mistakes in a way. Kind of taking the punishment as it were.   TLDR; Cordelia in Buffy, not so much. Cordelia in Angel, I think there are comparisons. Good observation :). And to be fair, I haven't read that play for a long, long time. 
4354	1,3,3,3	4	I understand its how many "pictures" you can see each second but how do you achieve it? How do animators (Anime, etc...) get to 60 FPS on their cartoons or shows, do they have to draw the same picture many times in very similar ways?  From my understanding, most are shot at 24 FPS but what would I have to do if I wanted to have it running at 60?  Thanks. ||||| Animation is done by a team of artists, not a single one.  The process isn't one guy sitting in a room and drawing a cartoon from front to back.  You've got people that design and draw the characters.  Scenes are originally set up on storyboards where they sketch out the where things are and where characters move.  When it comes time to actually draw a scene, you'd have a lead artist draw the 'key' frames of the animation and let junior artists fill out the details for the frames between them.  Often, these days, much of this is done by computers. ||||| Motion picture content (not just animation) is almost all at 24fps.  For 60Hz countries "3:2 pull-down" is used, i.e., every second film frame is displayed on TV/Video 3 times and every other frame is displayed 2 times.  The average is 2.5 frames and 24 * 2.5 = 60.  In 50Hz countries they speed the film up to 25fps (so films run a little shorter) and then display every frame 2 times to get to 50fps.  3:2 pull-down has the disadvantage that frames are not all displayed for the same time so things like slow, smooth pans have a juddery look on TV.  It turns out that even in cinemas they show film at 48fps with each film frame displayed 2 times on the screen.  Staying with 24fps makes the cinema experience too flickery.  Of course these days the change-over to purely digital projectors is well advanced bringing changes, including films like "The Hobbit" being shot at higher rates. ||||| In the old days they actually would draw the same picture 24 times in very similar ways, etc.  Nowadays it's all done by computer. You set up the motion in software and tell it how many frames you want to spit out and it spits out.  If you have something recorded at 24fps and want to play it at 60fps, you have to either show the same frame multiple times, or do what's called "interpolation" and make up new frames that are in-between shots of the existing frames.  Software can actually do this in basic cases; my TV actually does it by default, it raises a 24fps broadcast to display of 48fps (I think).

I currently play Najdorf, Nimzo and Queen's indian if that helps with any recommendation. Cheers in advance :)  ||||| To my understanding, the Modern Benoni is much more sharp tactically in most lines than the Czech, which usually results in a more closed position.  ||||| Czech Benoni is closed and strategical while the Modern Benoni is more risky and tactical to keep it somewhat simple. ||||| If you like the style of the modern Benoni, or the old Benoni, I'd highly suggest learning the Benko (or volga) gambit.  There are a ton of positions where benko-like gambits can be played and it will greatly increase your ability within the modern benoni.    Both the Czech and the modern benoni are strong.  If you want to play a very calm game with concrete ideas, and not a ton of opening preparation, the Czech is the way to go.  Positions are typically closed and long strategical midgames are to be expected.  It isn't the most active game, but a slow grind.  If that is your style, the Czech is for you.  The modern benoni is a very tactical opening that encourages positional exchange sacrifices, and often active and exciting midgames.  Both sides have play; white in the centre and black on the queenside.  Played wrong, you will lose quickly.  However, it is the stronger of the two openings; it gives you active play and ideas.  If you want rich midgames, and imbalanced endgames, this is the opening to play. ||||| Are you prepared to [fianchetto your knight]([URL] ||||| not my playing style, but my friend recently published this book on the cb. definitely worth checking out.

4404	1,3,3,3	4	I always see commercials where they advertise their food being homemade or made "fresh". Is that not false advertising? ||||| Homemade doesn't mean it was made at home. And fresh just means it's prepared when you order it, not premade and kept under heat lamps for hours.  ||||| Usually fast food commercials will say "homemade recipes", I'm not sure if they exactly refer to the food itself as "homemade" but the times they do I think they either refer to the food being cooked in that "homemade recipe" - like "homemade chicken" meaning "chicken of that homemade recipe" - or "giving a homemade experience".   "Homemade recipes" is not considered false advertising as it only implies that the "recipe" is homemade - which really says nothing except having a nice ring to it. In effect I could cook something and call it a "homemade recipe" despite having no culinary experience.   As to "fresh": fresh is kinda arbitrary. They do restock their supplies every morning so they can argue that the items are "fresh". Now the stuff they give you might or might not have been processed by a factory a few days ago, but as far as they're concerned if the product's not fresh, that's the suppliers' faults and not their advertising being false - they did receive the ingredients "freshly in the morning".  As for "freshly made", the fries they give you were not a moment ago sitting in the oil. The patties they put in your burger were put on the pans as orders are filled (precooked but freshly seared).  It's all so morally grey that there's no way to claim that they're falsely advertising their product without some way to refute that claim, and even if you find proof, they can always claim to be the unaware and shove all the responsibility onto the suppliers. ||||| They're probably using "homemade" to reference where the recipe is from. They're saying, "this is the same recipe that 'grandma' used to make her homemade biscuits 30 years ago." Darkchyylde already explained how they get away with saying "fresh."

Anyhow, most of the national ideas are just variants of a few basic themes in the end. Bonuses to morale or discipline, combat ability, missionary strength, trade efficiency, etc. But there are a few nations have truly unique ones that aren't shared in any form with other countries. Spain for example has that NI that allows them to claim any overseas province in the WORLD, regardless of whether they have any territory near it or not. There's no accounting for how useful that is. France has that idea that reduces native attacks and makes them likelier to assimilate, which is awesome for colonizing.   The national idea that gives a +.5 bonus to republican tradition is also really sweet, I think Novgorod and Ireland share it. ||||| Papal States, enjoy never having revolts and having everyone love you. ||||| Trade: The Hansa  Ground War: Prussia  Empire Building: Italy (not the Italian minors, actual Italy)  Monarch Point Stockpile: Milan  Bonus: Milan forming Italy.

This is not so for Najd.  ||||| France and Japan both have some pretty well rounded ones. ||||| I LOVE the Lithuanian ideas. ||||| The South Indian OPMs have damn good ideas, not the best in the game obviously, seeing as Prussia is a thing, but 15% production and 33% religious unity from traditions is dope and every single idea is actually useful, which i find is rare for national ideas.

Once you've got it running you could probably make it look pretty good, visually, given that DF can just sit on an otherwise unused CPU core, leaving a whole computer to work with. ||||| [URL] ||||| Going to say no.  this is not cool, it wouldn't be cool and if you really think it would be cool and want it done, go do it, then come back and then you'll probably agree with me.  
1347	1,3,3	7	Say the Fabregas transfer goes through for 40 million pounds.  Say the Clichy deal goes through for another 7 million.  Let's hope for the moment that Nasri stays.  Arsenal already has an [estimated 50 million]([URL] available in transfer funds.  That puts the transfer funds at almost 100 million pounds.  Chelsea showed that it's possible to spend half that on a single player when they bought Torres, but they also showed how bad a deal that can be.  Liverpool also showed that you can blow through transfer funds by buying untested players for enormous funds.  Time will tell if any of these transfers prove to be worth the money -- so far it doesn't look good.  Do you think there is a responsible way to spend that money to improve the squad for the upcoming season?  If not, would you be upset if Wenger took his time and tried to find players for the winter transfer window, or even the 2012-2013 season instead of trying to spend as much as possible before the end of August?  ||||| I still can't believe that Nasri or Fabregas is going to go. If Clichy goes, pick up Enrique or Baines, just to have a solid experienced player at LB, instead of forcing it on Gibbs when I don't think he's quite ready. We then pick up Gervinho, Samba, and Cahill for about 30m. So now we've got about 20m left, which happens to be Hazards estimated transfer price. I know they said he's not up for sale, but I think the idea of pocketing 30m from Arsenal is too much to pass up. Other than that, who knows? I desperately want to see Wenger splash the cash, but I do agree with his mentality of waiting for the right player and price. I have faith in the man. ||||| [deleted]
786	1,0,3,3	11	This post is made under the presumption that we could have a remaster each year, this is in no way confirmed and is very much likely to be dependent on the reception of and money we spend on MW Remastered. In addition, there is uncertainty for the direction of consoles so COD 4 remastered could make an appearance on PS4 and then later on PS5 (if consoles continue to be released, streaming services seem to be the new way to play video games, but it's impossible to tell yet)  It is also possible that remaster orders will mess up depending on what the studio working on the new COD are doing, for example if Treyarch make another WWII COD, there would definitely be second thoughts on a World at War Remake.  So this post is just for fun and a look at what we could possibly expect.  Year |Studio Making New Game|Possible Remastered Game/Bonus Release :--|:--|:-- 2016|Infinity Ward|Modern Warfare 2017|Sledge Hammer|COD Online (The China exclusive, there's been loads of speculation for this to become a global release, plus Raven worked on this) 2018|Treyarch|World at War 2019|Infinity Ward|Modern Warfare 2 2020|Sledgehammer|War Chest Collection - COD 1, COD 2, COD 3 (It's very hard to think of remasters SHG could do because they have little history, when they had a MP remaster of a map, they used one from MW2 - I feel that they highly relate to IW games over 3arc's. Although COD 3 was made by 3arc) 2021|Treyarch|Black Ops 2022|Infinity Ward|Modern Warfare 3 2023|Sledgehammer|Black Ops 2 2024|Treyarch|Black Ops 3 (The reception of the other CODs wont make them look favourable for a remaster)  And that's probably enough before it gets way too speculative, but inevitably we will have a release of a new game, then a remaster from around about a decade ago - so, if we like Infinite Warfare, we could see it back as a remaster in ~2025 (although they may choose 2025 as the year to remaster Black Ops 2 as it is set in that year). We may even get a full remaster of all the zombies maps in a game too, so that could fill the slot for another year.  Any thoughts on which games we'll have remastered and which would you most like to be remastered?   -Ducky ||||| Honestly I think none of this is going to happen. There's been such a high demand for a CoD4 remaster for so long now that it was bound to happen eventually. Sure, there are people who want to see other games back, with MW2 and BO2 at the forefront of that, but with the exception of MW2, I doubt any other games are going to get remastered, unless they release some sort of grand collection.  ||||| I could see MW2 and Black Ops 1 getting remastered. I dunno about the rest. ||||| lol what in 2024 black ops 3 again? no BO3 sucks dick tbh

1861	1,3,3,3	5	I would love to see some sources on this, and in particular sources from the recent year or two since as from my POV the polarization of US politics has only increased. ||||| I dislike people who claim to be independents yet don't have a single political belief that isn't Democrat or Republican. Especially people like Rachel Maddow.   Nothing wrong with identifying as a Democrat or Republican .  It doesn't make you anymore intelligent if you vote third party or identify as a independent. It's bad when you refuse to challenge your own beliefs.  ||||| Since the Bush years tarnished the GOP brand independent identification has grown rapidly in tandem with Republican identification falling. It's probably safe to assume they're mostly going to vote the same way, but interestingly will be absent from primaries. Presumably it's the moderates who've mostly left, but I'm not sure of that particular.

7034	1,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2	40	I have a serious shopping problem. I can spend $200 in one day, no sweat, on shopping alone. This is in addition to groceries and necessities. I have tried making a budget, Mint, You Need a Budget, LearnVest, envelopes, Dave Ramsey, journaling and waiting a week to buy things, only using cash, but nothing works. I keep impulse buying.  In February alone, I spent $71 on clothes and $954 on shopping (minus toiletries, school supplies, and printer ink).  Help!!! I am way out of control and it needs to stop. I need to be saving for school loans and a future apartment. What do I do?  PS: I think my issue with spending on clothes may have a lot to do with my disability. I've dealt with chronic pain in my right foot for years. I couldn't wear normal shoes, sometimes no shoes at all. I was always in pants and a tee. Thanks to a surgery, I can walk now and I'm wearing one pair of shoes that actually feels great and looks good with dressy attire. Maybe I'm trying to make up for all the time I lost before? ||||| (This is also a good question for /r/getdisciplined. Crosspost there for more answers.)  Edit: also forgot to mention Debtor's Anonymous. ||||| Ditch credit cards, set up your direct deposit to have a portion of your pay check go to a second bank. Ideally that would be a credit union that is never open on weekends and you can't get your money out of unless you really work at it. Keep your debit card out of your pocket unless you are going grocery shopping.  And as others have said work on your self control. That is the only way to really control spending, every time you want to impulse buy think if the item is a need or want, think about how many of said item you already own, and think if it something you will actually use.  Edit: you can also write down every cent you spend and what you spend it on. Do it every day don't skip it put it off. It could be a therapeutic way to watch your money dissappear day after day and maybe cut your impulse buying.  ||||| See a professional who specializes in this sort of thing. Perhaps a therapist of some sort? ||||| For me, when I give a store my money I have this feeling that they "won" and I lost. They got my money away from me with their tricky manipulative advertising. You need to look at the store as the enemy, out to take what yours and fuck up your life. I feel the best when I can buy something off of craigslist for 1/10th what I would pay in a store.  The only time I don't feel bad about spending money is food. I love good food and well, I need food to live! ||||| How do you spend, do you do a lot of online shopping? I have a decent amount of self control but at first it was hard to ignore the email subscriptions I signed up for. You should unsubscribe from those so you don't get tempted when they arrive. Aside from that, I also got in the habit of auto-deleting the ones I didn't want to remove for the time being and after a while, it becomes a habit. You really start to realize what you NEED instead of what you WANT and from that point on I think you'll have better self-control.  ||||| Most of my spending occurs at Target. I actually spent $71 on clothing last month. My grand total of shopping for February was $954. Should I just not go there anymore? ||||| Sounds like a serious issue even beyond just financial. As others have mentioned here, look into therapists and methods of overall discipline. You have or are getting an addiction. You need to treat it like you would any other addiction and get help. Budgets and such only work if you can overcome the addiction and maintain discipline. ||||| Also, it may help to go back and look at that massive spending bill in Feb and think to yourself: How much *joy* did I **really** get out of all that shit? ||||| Maybe shopping is a symptom of a bigger problem. I would talk to a therapist. ||||| Treat saving like a video game. Try to come up with new techniques to save money and get a higher score. Start hoarding money instead of hoarding all that crap you buy. ||||| I was an impulsive buyer awhile ago. I think the impulsiveness is a symptom of much deeper issues, for me I was spending impulsively due to low self confidence and being somewhat depressed with no clear idea of how my future would turn out. I would get a rush after blindly grabbing and buying things and would immediately regret it. The spending stopped maybe 2 years ago after I graduated school, worked on my self confidence, and generally started accomplishing things. I still once in awhile buy something I don't need but it's entirely manageable. ||||| You could always try bringing a friend or family member with you, when you go to places like Target, to discourage you from buying things you don't need. Someone who is financially secure and in a good place to be helping you decipher between necessities and extras. If you have someone to talk to, as opposed to just looking at stuff in the isles, that could really help. Also, make a list of things you need and do not stray from that list!  ||||| Ultimately it just comes down to self control. There's no method or trick that can help if you have no self control. Have you tried automatic deposits into your savings account? Freeze your credit cards and leave your debit card at home. Only carry $X with you at a time. ||||| [URL]  Or if it's really serious, you may need to seek help from a professional therapist of some sort.  There might be a chemical imbalance going on that isn't allowing you to have normal self control. ||||| Give every dollar a job. It makes it SO EASY. Every time I get paid, every single dollar of it is already assigned to something:   Example (assuming I have two paychecks a month)  $500 to rent   $110 to utilities   $300 to retirement accounts   $175 to food   $100 for long term expenses (gym membership, car insurance, etc) $86 for car repairs ($1032 total last year)   $50 for clothes   $80 for travel fund   $50 for gas ___________________ After all that is done, I only **HAVE** $100 left over for random shit. So how on earth could I spend more than that? Do I want to not be able to eat next month? Not be able to pay rent or fill up my gas tank?  ||||| I've been there before. Half the time, I just wanted to get out of my house. So I'd go drive for 10 minutes then go back home. Or get a water from a drive through.   Look back on your purchases, do you even like any of them? Keep one item, and return the rest. That may put into perspective what you truly like. I used to buy things as a way to see that I actually was paid for work. Or actually earned something. I wanted a reward every week or so, for being bored. Something to look forward to in a sense.   You don't have a goal besides needing money for an apartment. Why not save to $2k, don't shop for a month, sell some items before purchasing some.    ||||| Look back at the purchases you made.  Are they still impacting your life positively?  Or are they gathering dust in the closet, or even in the trash?  You spend a lot at target?  Nearly everything they sell is crap.  Stop.    Realize how long it takes you to earn every single dollar.  Is it worth trading that much time for some crap from target?  Look at some of your older purchases.  Find something you spent $50 on.  If someone offered you $50 or that thing, what would you rather have?  Money is freedom.  You're headed in a dangerous direction, full of debt and stress.  Every dollar you save will send you in the opposite direction, less stress, less worry, I could afford nearly anything I want right now, but I don't need it and it feels great. ||||| Just to echo /u/welliamwallace, you need a written budget. Every dollar has a name, a purpose, and a mission. It's your job to make sure each dollar completes its mission. Completely get rid of your credit cards. Destroy them. Don't swipe your debit card as a credit card if you know you're spending money that isn't accounted for. ||||| Are you buying these things in stores or online?  Stop going to stores other than the grocery store and block all of your favorite shopping sites.  Make any store emails you get automatically go to trash.  Avoid watching tv with commercials and don't read magazines that encourage shopping.  Find ways to occupy your time that distract you. ||||| I just joined You Need a Budget, /r/YNAB is a very inspirational place! ||||| You say $954 on shopping.  Break that down.

6449	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	24	What is the best and most useful multitool to have on you while on the bike? I have a birthday coming up and would like to get a few ideas?   Obviously leatherman/gerber/victorinox/sog come to mind, but which tool specifically? One with a 1/4" driver would make sense if that is an option.   Cheers! ||||| The most useful and versatile tool I've carried on every bike has been my phone. Runner up to my credit card.   The combination of those two can solve any problem. ||||| Wouldn't spend much on a multitool. Just add a couple of items to your bikes tool kit. Hex keys and a small long nose vice grips etc. ||||| IMO, majority of bikes come with a basic tool kit that does everything you'd want, and then some, on the side of the rode.  That said, any multi tool to add that should be more than enough.      All you really need in life are, vice grips, ducktape, a multi tip screwdriver, needle nose pliers, and a solid knife. ||||| A desert eagle. ||||| I carry this in my tank bag: [URL]  I also carry a couple of survival cards just in case I end up being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no cell signal: [URL]  You should go through your bike's tool set to look for things that you are missing. You should also carry zip ties,  and maybe a bolt to use as a peg or shifter if they break off in a crash. ||||| Zip ties and duck tape. ||||| I'm a dedicated Leatherman-man, myself. My daily tool is  a Rebar; the basic tool set but a bit smaller than the Supertool. The best tool is the one you have with you and it's small enough to always be on my belt.  The one feature that might be better suited to motorcycle riding would be a bit driver but the crosshead driver on my Rebar is actually a great bit.  Anddd now I'm shopping Leathermen. Great. ||||| A multitool is basically a knife and emergency tools if you're really without anything better.   I'm a Leatherman guy also, but I could also be a SOG guy if I were shopping now - something like the PX1001N which has a centered 1/4 driver up front when the pliers are folded in would make it less useless than most. :)  [URL] ||||| I love my Leatherman Skeletool CX, carry it everyday. Keep the bit kit in my tailbag. It's got the most basic tools, pliers, screwdrivers (and allens with the bit kit) and easily accessible knife. I used to carry a SOG knife everyday and the Skeletool is the the same size and way more useful.  ||||| A multi-tool probably won't do much for you as far as motorcycle related things go. Personally I carry a Leatherman Sidekick everywhere, however I also keep a small tool roll under my seat - crescent wrench, Phillips driver, flathead driver, and a metric multi-hex tool. Some electrical tape too. Every one of these items has helped me out in some way. I've never found myself wishing I carried 'x tool.' ||||| Carry a spare piece of stainless lock wire. In all my years, it was the only thing I needed. Tools can be found almost anywhere.   I was in the middle of nowhere. No cell service. Few people around. I broke a throttle cable and this guy rolls by in a group of 3. Stops and asks if he can help. Pops his seat off and had some wire. I was heading home in 5 minutes.   That being said, a Swiss Army knife with a Philips on it, quality mini pliers and a stubby 10mm go a long way.  ||||| I always carry my Leatherman Skeletool wether on or off the bike. It has all the features I usually need for life. In addition I have a Cruz Tools Outback'r M14 that I keep under the seat next to my BikeMaster Tire & Tube Flat Repair Kit. With these three I feel good when riding. My daily commute is an hour or so each way. I need to be prepared. I also have the stock toolkit on the bike.  ||||| I like the leatherman MUT but for a bike I have a tool roll.  ||||| Leatherman THREAD  [URL]

5654	1,3,2,3,3	7	With a little over a week to go, the Kickstarter campaign for my comic book, Sidekicks, is 187% funded.  I've been working with my artist for about a year to get this campaign going.  He did the pencils, inks, colors and letters for the 4-page preview.  The plan was to have him to continue to do all the artwork for the entire issue (and, yes, I am paying him a page rate).  The issue is, his comic penciling career has really taken off since he went under contract.  He's been getting a lot of work from a major publisher and it's been severely limiting the amount of time he has to work on my comic.  We're still on schedule, and I've created an incentive plan to try to keep it that way, but my fear is that delays will be inevitable.  I know I can keep him on as penciler and get the work done on schedule, but then I would need to hire a new inker, colorist and letterer.  Do you think Backers of this project would be upset if after the campaign ends I announce new additions to the art team?  Or should I just forge ahead and hope the incentives I put in place keep my artist on schedule.  Side note: I'm almost 100% certain my artist would be willing to scale back his involvement to just pencils.  As I said, he's been getting quite a bit of work.  Thanks for your thoughts.  Link to my Kickstarter: [URL] ||||| They will probably be more upset if you take forever to produce the book. ||||| can you get a written agreement stating a completion date it needs to be done by? With perhaps a bonus if he reaches it early? ||||| I don't think that your typical comic consumer is going to consider a change in inker, colorist, and letter to be a "change in staff."  The actual penciling is the "art" part of the "art" that your backers care about.  As long as your new help keeps up to the demonstrated standards I would expect literally zero negative response. ||||| Just make sure its good. Good is always good. Dont make it bad.

1643	1,3,3,3	8	After having a fairly long exchange with the extremely kind and helpful seller of DP2710s on ebay (dream-seller), he informed me that the price is currently at a high because units are limited and they are getting very few quality units from the factory (many are needing to go back due to quality issues). He says he believes this is due to a shortage of good Samsung panels.  He recommended that I wait until the price goes back to $279, as that will be indicative of stock being back to regular quantity/quality.  Just giving everyone a heads up, if you're thinking of purchashing now at the $325 price, please wait if you can. Once they are at $279 again, go ahead and bite. ||||| I think Samsung is realizing that they can still use the lower quality displays that they give to dreamseller in their own Samsung models to cut costs. Why bother selling products to private-label companies that are undercutting Samsung's main business? Why not lower their own products price, lower the quality grade slightly, and reduce competition all at the same time? Seems like a good idea to me. ||||| So, I found this monitor on ebay yesterday for $335 because of this thread.  I kept the ebay tab open to refresh and watch the price and today its up to $374.  So far, not looking good. D: ||||| I ordered one on the 11th, at $279. I messaged them a few days later and they told me pretty much the same thing. In the response, I was told they were getting a shipment on Thursday, and they will check them well before they ship. Here's hoping I get a good one :)
1820	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	15	I'm going to launch something big at my players soon, and I just know that one of the player will try and rodeo that enemy. That is, climb up on its back and strike at its neck. And I certainly don't wish to say no, even if its not supported by the rules in a good way. How would /r/Pathfinder_RPG handle this? ||||| It could easily be flavored as part of a grapple, except the enemy has to be at least large and doesn't gain the grappled condition and the roll to maintain it is a move action.  If the enemy attempts to remove him as a standard action, he can make a climb check versus the Enemy's CMD +5 to hold on. If the enemy instead opts to attack him, it takes a -4 on its attack roll and if it misses, that same roll is tested against its own armor class. If it fumbles, it hits itself.  Whenever he is hit, he has to make a climb check with a DC equal to the damage dealt to stay on.  The mechanical benefit for doing so, would probably be something along the lines of the enemy being denied his dexterity to his armor class against the climber, and possibly a reduction of its armor bonus by half (but not natural armor).  EDIT: The size of the enemy and the character's climb speed would probably actually be relevant, or the fact that if the character is a monk or ninja that can jump really high, they could skip a good deal of climbing. Large creatures are up to 15 Ft tall, which would take two climb movement actions to ascend all the way at normal (30 ft) movement speed. While mechanically they'd move as part of maintaining their 'grapple', keeping track is mostly fluff, but relevant for how far they fall if knocked off. If knocked off I'd also count the fall as one dice step further, but still entitle them to an acrobatics check to reduce a d6 to nonlethal damage, due to them expecting heavy resistance. ||||| Look at the "fighting on monsters" rules here. Written for 3.5, still works fine in Pathfinder:   [URL] ||||| Grapple. Equipment Trick feat. Find a way to Grapple opponents larger than yourself. (Easier.)  Proceed to hogtie a dragon. ||||| I would talk to the player about it, if the character is good at grapple, let him grapple his way there. If he's good at climb, let him climb there, and if he's adept at rodeo already (which typically should be the ride skill) let him use that. If the monster is huge or larger, figure out its height, and make him do at least a climb check as part of getting to the top. Engage by grappling (monster this size does not get grappled condition), there should typically be a lot of handholds, but a lot of turbulence, so give him a climb move action to try to reach the top during his turn. In its turn, the monster can try a grapple or escape artist to get rid of him, against his CMD, I guess. Otherwise, he needs to deal with the monster moving vigorously, make him take a climb, ride or acrobatics check (as appropriate for where on the monster he ended his last turn) to keep on. If he's just using a light weapon or unarmed, he doesn't need this check, as he's still grappling, but if he's in movement or trying to get a really hard shot at the monster's neck, that is, not using both hands to keep on, make him roll for balance. Finally, when he reaches the proper height and is ready to use his action to hit the monster, let him do so, and if the way there was properly strenous, lower the monster's AC or double his crit chance or something (if the neck is a weak spot), let him hit, and make sure it's difficult for him to keep staying by the neck. Good luck! ||||| If you don't want to mess around with the grapple rules, you could give them a climb check vs the monster's CMD, similar to the Tumbling rules. ||||| Technically this would be resolved with a grapple check. There's no restriction to the size of creature you can grapple, but it's going to be VERY hard to pull off as the creature will most likely have a very large CMD as opposed to your player's CMB. Not to mention that he'll most likely have a -4 to his CMB for not having both hands free if he attempts to attack with anything other than a natural weapon or unarmed strike (or armor spikes).  If you want to make it easier for him, you could allow him to make a climb check instead, but if he chooses this option, the creature is not considered grappled. (Of course, this is only 'easier' if he has put max ranks in climb and has a few extra boosts to it, otherwise his CMB and Climb will be close if not the same).

I also have half inch risers to give me more control and range on turns since my feet still stick out over the edge pretty far.   ||||| Larger guy here myself (6 foot, 190 lbs, size 12 boot - all over rider, trail and a little park) - i dont have any experience with the gear you mentioned, but sizing wise you should be good on a 161. I ride a 162 wide (board was a gift, but you learn to use what you have) and love it. especially the wider board. A smaller and less wide board may be easier to use in the park, but you get used to what is under your feet and it really doesn't make too big of a difference.  I have union force bindings i picked up this season. they are way lighter than years past and have been amazing. id recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat - either park or trails. ||||| huge skunk ape proponent here, although im 6'6", size 15. Also - I dont recommend flow bindings (or any rear-entry binding). They always feel wrong to me. My suggestion would be to try-before-you-buy with any rear entry binding, if possible.  ||||| I wear a size 14 in boot and I had some trouble with flow bindings. I wanted to like them but they just didn't fit my feet. They left my toes hanging out in the front and got annoying real quick. I use cartels because the front strap holds my toes in well.  I just couldn't recommend the flows ||||| Although I can't say I know much about skunk-apes or flow bindings, check eBay for these boards. I did a quick search and saw a skunk ape board available for $250-350, brand new.   I bought a $500 board, with $150 bindings in brand new (used once) condition for $350 a few months ago off eBay. Should be even easier to find something cheap now that the season is over.  ||||| [deleted] ||||| I used flow bindings for a half season and was not a fan. Maybe I didn't get them set up right but I did not feel very secure in my riding. After a few days on them I swapped them out for my old two strap k2 bindings and immediately knew what was affecting my riding.  ||||| Are you wanting to spend $800- $900 on a snowboard? Cause you can buy just about any new board from a board shop for $400- $500.   Never Summer SL or Heritage is also pretty good for the big guys, is 'rocker' though so far from ideal for Ice-coast. LibTech, Rossignol and a couple others offer cambered boards with Magnetraction, your best bet for the place you ride.  Forget about Flow bindings. Rear entry sucks, you must strap in standing up, great on the bunny slope, pretty shitty on anything else; and the fit you get is not very good either. Just get a regular pair of bindings, in the long run you will be infinitely grateful.  ||||| Flow bindings work great,  especially for the East Coast.   Mainly because you don't have to worry about them getting clogged with tons of powder.   They do need to be properly adjusted first to provide a proper fit.   ||||| I love flow bindings (I also have a flow board - not intentional). You may get a lot of flack for Flow bindings, but they are great. The only time I don't like them, is on a pow day - when snow gets in there, sometimes it takes some readjusting!   I don't do much park, but I jump little kickers and rails sometimes. I have never had a problem with them, although I have heard stories.    **TL;DR: I recommend flow bindings!**   Feel free to ask more - I notice most people denounce Flows. ||||| 6'2" 270  size 13 nike boot Arbor roundhouse midwide 157  Previously used flows and then moved on to GNU mutant bigfoots. I've used my friends traditional bindings and I could never imagine going on rear entry.  ||||| I'm 6'4, around 220, size 15 boots. I ride a 168w rossy krypto with cartels, I think the total cost was around 600, not including boots. Boots are the hardest part ||||| The skunk ape is an amazing board! Anything from Mervin mfg is great for that matter. A size 13 boot definitely puts you at a wide board, but you only need that long of a board (161) for pow days. I'm 6' and about 195lbs and the smallest board that I've ridden is a 154 which was just a little too small. I currently rock a GNU metal guru 155cm for park days, a Lib Tech T. Rice 157 for light pow and all mountain days and a (hand made by me) Smokin Snowboards custom Superpark 159 wide for deeper pow days. A longer board is only really necessary for super deep back country pow, so if you're mainly riding at resorts, stick to something a little shorter with lower spin weight and easier to throw around.           I also have rocked Flow bindings from day one. I have used and don't hate traditional 2 strap bindings, but Flows are the easiest binding to use and are super comfortable and solid. The newer ratchets they have now make a world of difference in ease of use and speed of adjustment. When I ride with my friends, I'm the first one headwind down the mountain because I don't have to sit down to strap in. I haven't had too much experience with their new Nasty technology, but I have my eye on the Fuse bindings... (Edit to add content)
7648	1,3,3,3	4	I'm beginning my preparation for track season once again, but I feel pretty down about my times. I am a JV female runner, and my mile time of 6:52 makes me the slowest runner on the team. How do you stay optimistic about an upcoming season or race? ||||| Look forward to improving. It is a lot of fun to start off one of the slower runners on a team and work your way up. ||||| You may be the slowest person on the team (for now at least), but you're still a whole lot faster than most people at your school!  And as xenonscreams said, you have a lot of potential for improvement! ||||| The fastest times don't make the best runner. The mile race is a challenging bit, and is arguably the largest race in track these days. Just remember that your time doesn't make up you as a runner. Focus on what you want rather than what your team does. Set goals for yourself and stay focused on achieving those. You need to make **you** happy, that's all that matters. Have fun and good luck!
2677	1,0,0,3,3,2,3	18	  I have lived in Astoria for over 30 years , and seen restaurants come an go. i've worked in the food industry and have seen all types of customers who are extremely rude, and nasty, I also have seen shitty and rude service, and the Sandwich Bar was def a good example. I arrived at 9pm and was quickly given a table. at 9:05 my waitress took my order which consisted of a Roasted Chicken Sandwich, Burger and sweet potato tater tots as an appetizer. 20 minutes go by , no appetizers , my waitress is chatting with a friend, 30 minutes go by my waitress tries not to make eye contact, nor updates us about our order. During this time the couple who was a party of 2 , and another group got their appetizers before us. 45 minutes go bye and our waitress who had a stank attitude and did not apologize came to us and said " Your order got mixed up it will be here in a few minutes". Now hungry as hell I got up and left and said "This place sucks" and walked out without getting any food , nor even getting complementary drinks due to their fault. Even worse was our waitress waiting 45 minutes to tell us without checking in our table and taking what ever free time she had to talk to her friend who was possibly eating free. In the end we went to the Pizzeria on Ditmars and got some kick ass panninis and great service. I understand that food takes a long time to cook ,but we are talking about comfort food and not a cuisine. Stay away from this place, Rude and shitty service. ||||| [empty] ||||| Sounds like you had a bad experience with one waitress. Having worked in the food industry you should know that a single employee doesn't represent the entire establishment.  ||||| The food is unremarkable for the price, I found. ||||| This place is totally hit-or-miss. I've gone at least four different times, and twice had a wonderful experience, and twice a TERRIBLE experience. The thing is, the hit isn't enough anymore to outweigh the misses. The food is decent (sometimes really good, sometimes not so great), and the prices aren't bad. The atmosphere is nice, but the wait staff can sometimes be a bit forgetful and rude.  ||||| Poor service, but did you try and flag her down? Did you ask another waitperson to check on your food? Did you say anything to anyone before leaving? ||||| I've been to this place many times and never had any issues with food coming out late or slow service.   Maybe you should speak to management about your experience instead of reddit.

7387	1,3,3,3	6	My favorite thing about Reason is how truly expressive it is from user-to-user. I love seeing / reading other peoples' little tricks they discovered when experimenting within the rack.   I'd love to hear some of yours! Nothing is too trivial since Reason 8 is completely new to me (I've been using Reason for over 15 years but Rack Extensions alone are enough to keep me busy for months). ||||| I can't wait to upgrade. I want that parallel processing/ channel grouping feature. Gotta upgrade my computer first though  ||||| Ok I'm going to violate both your requests (sorry). You can create a side chained reverb patch in 6.5 and you could possibly find this trick on youtube, however, it is awesome with the parallel channels.   1. Create a parallel channel and split the signal with a spider audio merger/splitter.  2. Rout one signal to a RV7000 and adjust it to your liking (possibly eq away some low and high end and remove initial delay) 3. Add some Saturation Knob distortion for flavor  4. Create a compressor with low attack and high compression ratio 5. Rout a dry signal from the splitter to the side chain input of the compressor  Voila, you now have a super nice parallel side chained reverb that you than can eq with the graphic eq! Don't forget to save the patch. ||||| Reason 8 is good in that instead of adding some new radical feature, they took what was good about reason so far and updated the UI to work so much simpler.   I still find myself doing things out of old habit that the new browser window handles twice as fast.  They are making it easier for you to make the music you want to make faster. There's a bit of a learning curve to Reason's deeper features but it's a pretty intuitive program once you know your way around it.
5689	1,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3	16	We've been running the ad lately trying to get people interested in a commercial that we are planning on shooting, right now we are actively looking for written testimonials from people as well that we can use to implement into the commercial as well. If you would like to share your story with us about how Kratom has helped you out in your life to spread awareness of the product and get rid of the "Legal High" stigma that it currently has. If you would like to submit a story please send it to kratomhelps@gmail.com and we'll be in contact with you and let you know if and how we intend to use it. Hope to hear from some of you soon.  ||||| I was hooked on oxycodone started taking kratom, and don't even think about oxy anymore. I take kratom like twice a week as opposed to 3 doses of oxy a day ||||| I had taken painkillers many times and didn't like them.  They were prescribed for minor operations/etc.  I simple didn't get it.  I thought painkillers were for losers.  I mean, I felt a little nicer than usual.  That's about it. My thoughts on painkillers when I was about age 20 were:  - Why do people get addicted to this?  Speed, cocaine, ecstacy, heck, even marijuana gets me higher than any opiates.   - I am an individual with self control, I would never get addicted to painkillers.  - I would never spend the money to get addicted to painkillers.  I enjoy saving and want to live financially responsible.    Around age 25, I had easy access to oxycontin.  I tried it, it was OK.. maybe pretty fun sometimes, never really a problem.  About a year later I tried Oxymorphone.  Whoah.  That shit?  WOW.. really, really, high.  Slowly but surely, I earned more money, so buying a little more wasn't less of an issue.  After taking oxymorphone for a few days, I would get withdrawals very rapidly.  So, I would fight those withdrawals with a lortab.  Maybe a tramadol.  Taper off, feel better.  Repeat.   Around ~27 my opinions changed: - This stuff (all opiates) really help chronic pain - I enjoy the increased energy & sociability  - I am very likely developing a minor physical dependence - Self control must be used to limit negative effects - I'll never be an addict.    After a year or so of the really high, fight minor withdrawals, taper off, I sought a new solution that happened to be easily available and WAY cheaper.  New addiction: - Methadone One 'done in the morning, and you're set for 18 hours.  Great!  They are cheap!  No up/down, hooray.  Methadone dependence.  Methadone addiction.  Lost source.  WD's VERY bad.  New addiction: - Lortab A few lortabs stopped the methadone withdrawal. Lortab addiction for a year. Became expensive because the high is short lived. Found a cheaper alternative.  Subutex.  New addiction: - Subutex.  Subutex addiction for ~ 2 years.  Lost source.  Tapered down subutex, experienced earth-shattering withdrawals.  Subutex addiction was terrible.  My blood pressure was high, I had no regard for others in my life.  I felt like a turbo zombie with nothing to lose.  Sleep deprived, poor nutrition, some damaged relationships.  Family & friends suspected something.  Looked like shit, felt I wasn't healthy, but subutex masked all of that.  Not a single fuck was given - other than how/when I would do more sub'.   - Death of a friend in late 2015 was a wake up call.   - Death of a distant friend a month later was a wake-up call reminder.  Their deaths weren't related, but only in that they overdosed.  Young, white, upper middle class.  Hey, that's me! Maybe I could not wake up one morning after partying? Maybe I could break the hearts of those that loved me so much.  Maybe my dirty secret would only be revealed in my death?  - Back to lortabs - can't take off work to withdrawal for weeks.  Extreme pressure to preform at work.  - Back to anything - anything to fight the withdrawals. Oxy/Lortab/heroin.   - Friend suggest kratom.  I call bullshit.  Some plant can't help me.    - Reluctantly tried kratom.   Kratom seemed to help the terrible subutex withdrawals.  Never felt "high" on kratom.  I felt NORMAL again.  For the first time in almost 5 years, I wasn't seeking drugs, spending money, sniffing crushed pills or heroin into my sinus cavity.  After about 2 months I noticed:  - Appetite returns - Blood pressure returns to healthy range - Felt "emotions" for the first time in a few years - Junk food cravings significantly reduced - Nicotine cravings significantly reduced - Sleeping more - Back pain is better  A terrible cycle has come to an end.  I am new to kratom, only using for about 4 months however it feels like I have hope for a longer, happier life.  Slowly, but surely, I can feel my body adjusting to not being addicted to potent FDA approved pharmaceuticals.  People say I look healthier.  I feel healthier.  I plan to slowly taper off kratom, and finally be completely normal again.  Happy to answer any questions. Hope this story helps!    - TL:DR.  A long cycle of opiate abuse has been stopped with the help of Kratom.  Pharmaceutical free & happy for the longest time in ~5 years.   ||||| Keep up the good work! ||||| Is it OK to post your story here?  I wouldn't mind sharing my story, but I am more comfortable with the anonymity here.   ||||| I heard kratom helped with social anxiety and increased motivation to get things done. I can say that from experience it does both of these things to a great extent! ||||| Kratom has helped me in the area of mental health only, before Kratom I couldn't hold a job or leave the house nor ever drive a car without having severe anxiety attacks that would scare the crap out of me and make me think I'm dying constantly, going to bed at night was horrible and didn't get much sleep either due to my racing thoughts that would keep me up.    Kratom hasn't fixed me, totally but it helps me sleep finally which is natural because I don't like taking sleeping medicine or anything of that.   It also has helped so so much with my racing thoughts and so much more. ||||| A bit redundant that I've emailed this to you firstly but I figured it's worth posting here too:  Kratom has been a blessing. Rarely is there a legally available alternative to treating real pain while retaining functionality, and motivation. There are narcotic-like effects: this kills pain and gives motivation. But what's different about kratom is that it demands respect, and teaches you discipline. Want to get high off of kratom? Expect to be puking, or stuck feeling sick for a long period, usually something the user won't repeat often. Unlike traditional painkillers, where a high dose will kill you, and cause horrible mental and physical side effects, kratom will send you hurling. What better way to learn the hard way than to be given a second chance?  I've suffered from chronic pain for most of my life, as well as severe depression. When I use kratom I'm able to be in a mindset that allows me to analyze why I was depressed, and to effectively re-associate things I had been seeing only in a negative light. These lessons were retained after using kratom. They've saved me from horrible cycles of depressive triggers, over and over, knowing to be vigilant and aware of my body and what it wants and doesn't want. What does it want sometimes? Kratom. But here's the kicker: I'm able to learn because kratom can't be abused the same way painkillers generally are. I know not to use it too frequently (because it stops working) and too much (because I become immediately sick), so I have to learn to deal with compulsions. It's no different from any other compulsive thing, like wanting junk food. Dealing with that compulsion is relatively simple: healthy food is better in the long run, save yourself the quick reward system zap and live longer because you aren't living from point A to point B, dopamine response 1 to dopamine response 2.  I've extensively analyzed why I enjoy doing things when I'm on kratom. Again, this is something I can retain. It's taught me to enjoy aspects of my job I didn't even think to analyze certain aspects of my job that were rewarding, which left me feeling ever more depressed beforehand.  As for pain, I've got problems no regular medication can fix, only extensive surgery which I'm not ready to commit to yet. Kratom is simply a great functional painkilling substance, with the benefit of being natural and with the extra quality of teaching me fair and reasonable life lessons, responsibility and the like.  Without kratom existing I'd be a hundred times more depressed, and thereby in far less better health than I am, I'd be out of a job, I'd be out of life force. I haven't used kratom for weeks, because I don't find it addictive after learning to respect what it is and knowing what it can, and what it can't do for me. People need to learn these crucial life lessons first hand, not just be told "don't take drugs". Instead of nurturing devious behaviour, how about we educate people about how to be responsible.  Ban the tree, do what you like, but you can't take what I've learned away from me. All you can do is leave me and millions of others in pain, or stuck dependent on pharmaceuticals. Bless this earth and it's ability to produce medicine of this sort for it's inhabitants. I'll vouch for kratom's viability as a useful plant any day, for the rest of my life. ||||| I found kratom originally as a way to get high when I could't due to drug tests due to trouble with the law because of getting caught smoking. I loved it, I could take it in a social setting that would normally give me so much anxiety I would often bail on friends to the point I was becoming a recluse and sabotaging my relationships with friends and family. The only time I was being social was when I was drinking heavily. So I started taking kratom instead of drinking one time and I had no social anxiety, no thinking that others were judging me, no nervousness, conversation flowed. I did this for a few months and then I wanted it all the time and I had to re evaluate my usage and remember that kratom is very much a drug. depending on the person more so than alcohol and marijuana. I still use kratom in social settings and prefer to use it that way now. It's one of the best antidepressents ever, someone smart should look into this as a treatment. Like a very low dose extended release thing.
7813	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	28	If I recall correctly in the previous episode, before Andrew turned into Lash, he told May to "use Lash". Does anyone else think we might see a battle between Lash and H.I.V.E? ||||| I am assuming he is there to fight hive.   Lincoln said that the inhumans powers were picked to balance things.  ||||| deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9494  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?]([URL] ||||| I've been saying since before the show said it:   He is a predator type Inhuman designed to maintain the equilibrium (as Lincoln put it) within the Inhuman "species". Mack said he was like a shark and I think this is correct. The Kree knew how potentially dangerous the Inhumans would be and if their numbers increased too much they could easily destroy a planet ... not to mention likely be able to rebel against their "masters".   Inhumans like Lash were designed to keep the Inhuman population manageable.  Thus Lash will be the "secret weapon" used to help defeat Hive. ||||| To rek SquidWard. ||||| oh yes. very yes. ||||| With all this "Inhuman powers fill a need", I'd say Lash's purpose is to thin the number of Inhumans now that there's an outbreak. ||||| Lash came into being out of Andrew's anger at Inhumans for the events that happened in Bahrain. In his mind they are responsible for the failure of his marriage to May and even though Andrew was a kind, well-adjusted person on the surface he had a ton of anger in his subconscious mind. Terrigenesis gave him a way to express that anger and while Lash is not what anyone would call a positive transformation Andrew needed it. ||||| I've posted this theory around here before, here I go again.   Lash isn't so much designed to kill Hive as he is designed to be the solution to Hive. We haven't seen how yet, but Hive is able to control or otherwise sway Inhumans to his cause. He's pretty powerful on his own but I'm guessing his real power is in his ability to control multiple Inhumans and integrate them as part of his Hivemind. Hive's pretty strong but Hive+hundreds of Inhumans with all sorts of interesting abilities all controlled by him is...terrifying. I posit that it's not *all* Inhumans he's able to control, and that Daisy is one of them. That's why Lash didn't kill her when he had the chance or otherwise show any desire to kill her. Daisy is "worthy" because she's an Inhuman that isn't susceptible to Hive's control.   So Lash's instinct is to destroy the "unworthy" Inhumans so that they cannot be used by Hive. Let's also not forget that if every Inhuman fills a void, that Hive has a purpose and a reason too. I hope that will be explored a bit when we see more of his backstory/origins.  ||||| I don't think it's a might, I think it's a when.  ||||| I see that happening as well.  The question I come to is whether or not Lash will survive the encounter.  I don't think he will. ||||| Lash is around to die stopping Hive. ||||| Cull the herd.  Lots of new Inhumans = New Inhuman that needs to kill Inhumans. Population control.  ||||| Fight Hive, also prevent any Inhumans from falling under his sway - even if it involves killing them. ||||| That was my thought once he ran into that cube.  They will unleash Lash vs. Hive, since Hive can't harm Inhumans (if I understood correctly).    Also, Hive must have watched Matrix Reloaded a lot, because he's dressing like he's The One. ||||| If Hive Dies will this be the end of Brett Dalton since his original character Grant Ward is already dead? ||||| Pretty much what everyone here (and on other forums) think; Lash's sole purpose is to fight and/or kill Hive. Which is predictable, sort of like how I am certain that Fitz and Simmons will be eventually paired together (then it will end in one or both of their deaths. Because Whedons). I mean that has been telegraphed since Season 1- it's obvious to everyone, just like how people were able to predict that Andrew is Lash. It's all too obvious and it's as subtle as being hit with a hammer over the head.     ||||| [I wrote this a while ago saying he had a purpose and I got alot of hate]([URL]

Not enough Hank this episode. Way to many secrets going on. Also I really wish Nick would simply talk to Renard and Adalind instead of letting Eve control him because it is without a doubt going to back fire on him.  ||||| How much do you want to bet the law firm is working for Black Claw? ||||| That baby is so damn cute.  He looks like my nephew.  And he's all happy to see wesen.  Definitely a Grimm-ling. ||||| If Black Claw has Diana, does this mean that Black Claw is a (splinter) group within the Resistance?

Kokkuri-san]([URL]  > Folklore has it that Inugami can be conjured through a complex and cruel ceremony: A common pet dog must be buried up to its neck where only the head remains free. Then, a bowl with food or water must be placed close, but in unreachable distance, before the dog. After several days have passed as the dog is about to succumb, its head must be severed and buried beneath a busy street. After some time, its head and body are to be placed in a well-prepared shrine. Thus, an Inugami is evoked.  [According to the Grimm wiki]([URL] Jin Akagi and his family (and his lawyer) were all [Kitsune]([URL] though the episode doesn't really suggest that they have any of the qualities traditionally attributed to the mythical beings.  Anyway, that was a pretty interesting episode. It did a good job of weaving a new Wesen type into the episodic plot while continuing to advance the season-long plot about Renard and Adalind. The return of Diana (aka super-baby) is certainly a game-changer. I'm curious as to how that will affect things next week. ||||| I always like it when they incorporate things from other cultures like this. ||||| that's definitely not the diana from last season.  interesting to see where the character will go, though.  and i know rachel was not lying next to renard implying he should propose to adalind? *sigh*  leave sean and the littlest hexenbiest where they are; they are both much better as allies to the grimmy gang.  eh, maybe these new obstacles will help them to become better people in the long run, but this whole flip flopping back and forth nonsense is irritating.  and bring back teresa.  too much away on assignment.  there's always room in the cast for teresa. ||||| Love Bitsie Tulloch.

If you now install wheezy then you will want to upgrade it few months later when jessie hits stable anyway, I wouldn't even bother even though the upgrades are relatively painless. ||||| You could take a look at the [Librem]([URL] or [System76]([URL] HP, Dell and Lenovo also manage to sell laptops to enterprises that want to run Linux (like Google, no Windows allowed) ||||| You can basically install jessie now, as it's frozen. No need to do wheezy anymore on new installs. Jessie works out of the box with GPT-partitioned disks and UEFI mainboards. For hardware compatibility, check the support of the default shipped kernel 3.16.7. ||||| Google for people who have successfully ran stable on the specific model you're looking at.    As a general rule though, driver compatibility only improves with versions.  You're likely to have better results with the newer versions rather than older.    In the end though, there's no getting away from just asking around.  Unless the manafacturer explicitly releases it as 'working with debian X' then you basically have to find people who've successfully done it to be sure. ||||| The one thing i would be paying close attention compatibility wise would be the WiFi & Bluetooth card's of the laptop. Those are the two components which would always give me trouble, make sure you check which ones are in the laptop you are buying and that they **work well with the kernel version** that is currently in Debian (my 3 years old laptop still wont recognize Bluetooth due to a kernel bug, the bug was fixed quite a while ago but Debian still hasn't caught up ...). The camera might be another component you wanna have a look at. As others mentioned unless you are buying some laptop which was 'just released' they are probably others who already tried so Googling will most likely give you all the info you need for any specific model. ||||| How about a laptop from ZaReason. built for Linux? I have a desktop from them and I'm very happy with it and will buy my next PC from them.      See [Chimera 2]([URL] from the specs:   > 4th Generation Intel Core Processor       Bright, anti-glare 17.3" LED backlit display @ 1920x1080 pixels       Nvidia GTX Graphics           Nvidia GTX 970M dedicated graphics with 6GB video memory           Nvidia GTX 980M dedicated graphics with 8GB video memory (optional)       Blue Backlit Keyboard with on/off switch + brightness control       Two SATA 2.5" drive bays       Up to 32gb of memory (4x SO-DIMM slots)       Output up to three simultaneous displays between HDMI/VGA/LCD       High-Definition Audio Stereo Speakers+Subwoofer and Microphone       WiFi included       Bluetooth included       SD/MMC Card reader       Combo CD-RW and dual-layer DVD-RW drive included       3.0 megapixel HD webcam       Dedicated number pad      Or were you looking for something even more badass? ||||| Is a recent kernel in backports allowed? I run jessie which will be stable soon on a Samsung np900 with no problems although I had to set up keys for some Samsung specific features.  Also see [URL] ||||| Stable (Wheezy) will probably work unless your laptop has a current-generation Maxwell-based Nvidia GPU. I think AMD will probably be OK since they haven't made any big changes to their architecture lately.  That said, don't be scared of Testing. I've been running it on my PCs for years without problems. I only use Stable on my servers because I can't risk anything going wrong, and if it does I might have to make a trip to the data center. But for a laptop, I consider it more important to have up-to-date software. ||||| The new dell 15 inch that was showcased at CES this year will have a developer edition which means full compatibility with Ubuntu. Presumably this will mean that Debian would work just as well.   ||||| Why has nobody mentioned thinkpenguin.com yet? ||||| Not to boast or anything. But I have yet to find a laptop that I couldn't run linux on, eventually. Maybe there were some inital issues at first, but nothing a bit of googling wouldn't fix.  Then again, I work as Linux Sysadmin, so your mileage may vary.  That being said, the classic issue with laptops is usually network connectivity. Wifi chips can be finnicky, and on occasion even some LAN chips were so new, they threw older kernels for a loop.  It's been rare that I found a piece of "necessary" Hardware on a laptop, that just was impossible to run under linux. Most often its the case, are the drivers already supported by the kernel, or easily installable via the package repositories? Else, grab some source code and start compiling.   You can never be 100% certain beforehand, since actual installed chips may vary, even if it doesn't say so in the specs. But nonetheless, a little research beforehand can go a long way.  ||||| Stable+backports should run on most.  What model are you interested in?  I've got a Lenovo T430s that is good, no issues.  I hear the T440s should also work. ||||| Michael of Phoronix just got his new [Broadwell Thinkpad]([URL] running Ubuntu 14.04. That laptop should be pretty good for Debian Jessie. ||||| I picked up an Asus Republic of Gaming 17".

317	1,3,3,3,3,3	8	[empty] ||||| The tattoo that I got is a cloud with a lighting bolt underneath. I decided to get this tattoo because it means the world to me. I was about to die on a hiking trip and I remember when I was saved seeing a perfect could and lighting bolt underneath, and I felt an enormous peace in my heart. After that I could not stop thinking about it so I decided to get my tattoo. People think its childish when they see but I don't care I didn't do it to please them, I did it for me and to remind my self of that day. ||||| 4 tattoos here. Every tattoo i have with the exception of one, has a deep significance to me. I’ve only gotten one tattoo that was strictly for good looks. ||||| 3 tattoos. All have some sort of meaning.   1) I have two of my Irish family crests on my left arm. I know each crest doesn't typically represent a family but more of a person or head of the family, but it still means a lot.   2) On the back of my right leg I have a keystone with a tree in the middle and my area code and zip code around it. I am from Pennsylvania which is knows as the keystone state and Pennsylvania is "Penn's woods"   3) My biggest and personal favorite is my TMNT sleeve on my right arm. All 4 turtles and Master Splinter. Obviously I am a big fan but it also reminds me to always be myself regardless of what it is and to always be a kid at heart.  ||||| Some have meaning, some I just liked. For meaningful ones, I have my daughter's footprint, a tattoo for my mom who passed away, a quote and three birds for my sisters and I, a momma and baby owl for my daughter and I. Then I have flowers, song lyrics, a sugar skull and stars.   My next ones are all meaningful...I want to get my real mom, my adoptive mom and my grandma's birth flowers, and one of my daughter's drawings.  ||||| I got it because I finally feel I have recovered from my past and am whole and wanted a permanent personal reminder of all I've overcome.   It's a turtle with a puzzle piece in the shell, if you want to see what it looks like I posted a picture of it in /r/tattoos and you can see it in my profile. 
2691	1,0,3,3,3,0,3,0,2,3,3,0,2,3	16	We have an over-population problem. And most people's strategy is to be apathetic. When you ask somebody "What job will your kid have?" they will not say "I''l provide him with a job.", they say "The government will make some reforms and give them something.". That's because they are religious, they think that, just because God is imprinted on money, the money comes from God.  I have news: the government does not get money from God. It gets its money from richer people. And we have 2 problems here. When you have kids, you unjustifiably take money from rich people. The second is that there are only so many rich people before you run out of money. To be short, the money is limited and it belongs to somebody else.  That's why capitalism makes sense to me. If you have it, you have it. If you don't, you don't. I'm not being an asshole here. Of course, we should help the kids. But never the parents, nothing to the parents, parents get shit. No tax breaks for parents, no nothing!  Did I say we should help the kids? I meant *some* kids. No public education should exist. We should only give free education to smart poor people. They should be really smart, tested beforehand. And they should be poor, we don't want a rich and greedy cunt to falsify the results of her stupid rich brat. The rich should still pay, even if they're smart.  The rest of them? Fuck them!  Oh, and we should have lots of police. That's because we know how education really works. As George Carlin said "education is one thing, but if you lack the IQ, it's all meaningless" (paraphrase). If people want to go to college despite being stupid, that's fine. They go in there, they learn poetry and useless "creative" crap. But what happens when they get out? They realize how empty their "education" was and it becomes out problem. And they turn to crime and boring generalized disobedience (like refusing cakes to gays, because they are mediocre bakers). That;s when we need the police.  Also, bonus question: how schizophrenic do you have to be in order to be both a Christian and a conservative? Jesus was a pacifist socialist ("turn the other cheek", "sell everything and give it to the poor"). I think that we atheists would be way better conservatives than Christians are.  ||||| Holy fuck that was a nonsensical rant. I'm not a far left leaning person like most around here but this random bullshit you spew isn't even logically consistent and is straight up facist in parts.   ||||| Societies that provide social assistance to all citizens are demonstrably healthier than those that do not.  ||||| Obvious troll is obvious, but at least they shitposted on a Sunday. ||||| All of the 20th and 21st Centuries have been spent, politically, trying to find the ideal balance of capitalism and socialism. If there are not enough restrictions on free trade, people (labor/poor) die by the boatload. If there are not enough incentives to compete then the economy (and society) becomes stagnant.   Saying all that, I think you will find the issue in the US isn't AN issue but a two-fold problem; there is too much socialism when we need capitalism AND vice versa. For example, the solution to our economic instability? More socialism at the Wall Street level (stop electronic front running) and more capitalism at the small business level (eliminate the payroll tax).   It is ignorance to assume one side has all the solutions and the other side caused all the problems. But to further the cause of making you feel persecuted (cause I know American Conservatives get off on that), conservatism is generally a desire to return to a previous situation or at minimum maintain our current situation. Either of those is truly madness if you think there is a problem with our current political landscape and consider our prior one. I for one would hate a return to a lack of civil rights consider I am a member of an easily targeted minority (atheism). ||||| You certainly seem stupid enough to be a conservative! ||||| Well, it is Sunday. ||||| That's one of the dumbest things I've ever read. You're not doing conservatives any favours. ||||| This relates to atheism how? ||||| Turns out, even as an atheist, you can still be batshit crazy. If what you said was true about rich people being the only ones who are forced to distribute their money to the middle class and the poor, the bank bailouts would never happen.    ||||| No, you're not the only atheist conservative, but we might be the only two. ||||| Those were almost sentences. ||||| A weird nonsensical possibly meant to be satirical rant,  right? ?

8254	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	9	It seems like I always have pretty average teammates, sometimes they're good and sometimes they're bad etc... But as soon as I enter a promo series, I swear I get the people who are so bad, that you're not sure if they're trolling or trying.  Is the system like this on purpose? Am I just really unlucky? Because only in promos do I get the ADC who dies 9 times before level 6.  P.S. This isn't a rage post/rant, I'm genuinely asking. ||||| You actually get those sorts of people all the time, it's just that you remember them more vividly since it's your promos and it matters a lot more.  These people are also sometimes in your game but on the enemy team, just have the mindset that if you have a terrible team one game it's possible that type of player might be on the enemy team in the future. ||||| I like to (roughly) quote Imaqtpie on soloQ teams. "If you start a sentence with 'my team,' then you deserve the elo you're at." ||||| Eh. Just feels like it for you honestly, because your promos feel more important so they're more memorable.  I've gotten AFKs for my promos repeatedly and only in my promos. I've also had the guys that feed and rage. But...  I was 'that guy...er girl' in my promos once, going 0/10 in probably the worst Jayce game I've ever had. I've gotten carried hard, pretty much just farming and not dying and going along with my team.  It pretty much evens out when you look at things over time I think. ||||| Yup. I have no problem getting to promos its winning them thats the problem. However i wouldn't always say its because of "Those people" that we lose. I think its because the mindset that we HAVE to win the promos.  puts more pressure on you so when somoene fucks up sometimes you will react emotionally to it because you "need to win" Its when flaming or raging starts that you begin to lose the game.  Im only silver on two account but my advice would be:  *Try to think about the games as "I want to win this" and not "i need to" *Try and only concentrate on your lane, it doesn't matter if others are feeding if you get hung up on that you are going to distract yourself *Be ruthless: Bleed the enemy of gold. Take all the objectives that you can Drakes, towers, wards are all important as you know   Note im not that good at the game but general tips i try to go by hope it helps :)  edit: format fucked up "*" is a new point/ tip ||||| dont tell people your in promos its just more reason to troll ||||| You get them in every game. The key problem is that we're much more sensitive to them when we're in our Promos because there's so much more on the line.

Paradox had already crutched the expenses of a year of delay and i am sure that when they looked at the product when they did cancel it they saw something that was not to the standard of Paradox and they were not willing to release it or support it further so they cancelled it.  Paradox can not be blamed for this decision, they held out much longer than most other publishers would have, it was just going to continue being a money sink. ||||| Project went enormously over-budget, over-time and was probably a bit mismanaged. I'd like to know the BL Logic had a producer on their backside the whole time or not. And if not, if they had their own "business person" on it.  Cause that is pretty much a major reason for many smaller teams to go belly-up. A bunch of enthusiastic modders or other coders that think "We have the next big idea!" witout, sadly, having any clue about business or handling money. So they begin work, burn money, and at some point stand there with nothing left and must beg their publiser or bank for money. Both are not amused in those cases.  Let me tell you, there are legitimate reasons to be pissy about publishers. Shouting at them because a small team went belly-up, after more than a year of being over-budget and over-time... that's just not fair or reasonable anymore.

I'm in and out of my vehicle all day so it's at least better then listening to the same top40 crap. I'm a big fan of NPR. I use to live in Orlando and really liked Real Radio 104.1 when they had Daniel Dennis and Drunkie the Bear (Tom) on the Monsters in the Mornings and SBK Live at night. Since moving here to Tampa I've been into 102.5 The Bone but mostly just the Cowhead show, now known as the Mike Calta show.    Now to keep on topic I will direct my next comment towards [BTLS]([URL]   **Bubba is now nothing more than a blowhard salesman...** All he does is pander products and services to listeners. And not in the normal radio ad way. No he takes his sales pitches next level by devoting hours of his show time to talk about them. And when he isn't doing that they are filling time by replaying the shit out of the same old bits over and over. Bubba is a self-important egotistical narcissist who still puts on a Zoo radio show even though he says he doesn't and continually bashes other radio shows for having a similar format. Bubba is also a bully who harasses others for attention. I could only stand to listen to his show for about 15 min at a time before I got sick of his BS and turn the dial.   I could go on but I'm tired of ranting right now. However I will gladly continue a talk radio discussion if you want. And I want to make it clear I don't care what people listen too.

2245	1,3,3	3	Hello - I am considering taking advantage of a current deal for a VPN vendor. I've never used a VPN, and I've been poking around google for a couple days trying to figure it all out. I have a couple questions, a few I'm sure will seem stupid. Thanks for hearing me out and all of your help!  1. Is it software? Will the VPN install something on my computer, and it takes care of itself?  2. I've seen some people say that they need to switch servers, and VPN services host servers everywhere. Does that mean when I'm using the VPN, my internet can randomly go down at home and I will need to manually switch the VPN server from the computer software locally? (This is important because I run a Plex server, and I don't want any down time!) 3. Specifically with Plex, I see that a big issue with a lot of people using VPN's is speed. Will running a VPN also slow down the speed at which I can stream from the Plex server on the same network? If slow speeds are inevitable, can I manually turn on the VPN when I need it (downloading torrents) and turn it off when I'm not (streaming movies from Plex?  4. My wife casually watches Netflix (we live in the US). Will this complicate her casual usage? Will I have to manually switch to a US server when she wants to watch US Netflix?   That's all I can think of for now. Thanks!  ||||| 1. No it is not software. VPNs are online services which are basically setting up a tunnel which passes all your internet data securely to another remote computer before it exits to the wider internet. Once you get one, you need to configure your computer to use it. Sometimes there will be additional software which will allow easy configuration or location switching but this is not the default.  2. the VPN will not interfere with your home network, and will only affect the internet activity of the computer/s it is set up on. Usually you will need to manually switch servers if you want to change your apparent location.  3. As I already said, this will have no affect on your local network, only your internet connection.  4. AFAIK Yes you will have to manually switch to US to watch the netflix you've paid for. But also netflix has been cracking down on VPNs, so there is a chance they would've blocked your VPN provider. The only way to test this is to try. ||||| If you aren't using VPN for security then you could always just switch it off when you access Netflix. That way Netflix will see your ISP and you will get USA Netflix. 
7373	1,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,3	29	Ok by now we know this list is a bunch of bull but seriously, he deserves to be top 50 at the lowest. What's everyone else's thoughts? I know it's probably spectacular for an OL to be recognized in the top 100, but he's a top 5 O-Lineman so he should definitely be higher.  ||||| Wow. This is just disrespectful now, Marshal Yanda was the best offensive lineman in the league and he is #79 on the list? Whatever this list is a bunch of bullshit anyways... ||||| What didn't make sense was how Joe was like 58 last year after a bad year for Joe and was 97 this year after a career year.. ||||| He definitely should be way higher, but it did say he was the only guard on the top 100. Either way NFL network ducking Ravens players hard ||||| Who cares. We know he's a beast. Opposing teams know he's a beast.  ||||| I was sure that he would be our highest rated player and be somewhere in the top 20... Guess not. ||||| The only position that has a bigger dropoff from best to second best in the league is DE (because JJ), but sure, 79, why not. ||||| Top 100 lists hate the trenches and love the skill positions.  Offensive linemen don't have highlight-reel splash plays.  Guys like Yanda will always get disrespected.  Then one day, he'll be driving Forsett out to the second level, and he'll encounter some linebacker that is top 20 on this list.  And Yanda will blow him to pieces.  Total yard sale.  Helmet flying off, one shoe missing, mouthguard into the stands.  Disintegrated.  Forsett will scamper for a touchdown, and we will cheer.  And Yanda will have gotten revenge, the Ravens way.  When they disrespect, it only gives our guys more motivation. ||||| I don't really find it surprising. This is the age of fantasy football, it will be highly skewed to receivers, running backs and quarterbacks. O linemen don't really have the tangible stats to get out up there, so they get left off the board.   He should be higher up, but I'm glad he made the list at all. Someone said he's the only guard on the list. ||||| this is plain criminal  ||||| I faintly remember someone mentioning that this is ratings for the 2013 season, which explains why everyone is so low.

How many players? Do you have a preference for game length maximum? How about letting us know what other games you liked/disliked and why? ||||| I have both and I'd go with Concordia over Bruges any time.   ||||| Concordia. ||||| I agree, **Concordia** fits what you're looking for a little better. I quite like **Bruges** at 2-3p, but I don't think it scales up very well. Technically it's playable at 5p with the expansion, but I would rather not do that again.  In general, I like the expansion and it rejuvenated the game for me overall.   **Concordia** is perfect at either 3p or 5p, though, and plays quite well at 2p and 4p even with less competition for resources and cities. There's an expansion map for variety, but it's not at all necessary. There is plenty of variety as it is in the tile setup and order that the cards come out.  It keeps getting better for me.    **Bruges** is an 8, but **Concordia** is a 10.   ||||| Concordia is an almost perfect Euro: easily understood gameplay, solid choices and hidden scoring that builds suspense. Great game, very hard to beat.

1484	1,2,3	9	What I'm looking for is a way to practice reading and writing kana really quickly on a desktop computer, with the chance of absorbing random vocab words along the way as a side effect.  I use WaniKani already, but the going there is very slow. This is more of a supplement kind of thing to help with recognition level vocab reading that isn't based on multiple choice selection.  Ideally I'd love to find:  * Retyping something already on the screen, similar to a touch-typing training program * Kana words/sentences that also show equivalent kanji and approximate english translation * Options for randomized typefaces, to helps practice recognizing incomplete and distorted characters  * SRS style distribution so it won't show you the same ones too much. * Vocab sets from games so I can later practice in the "wild", e.g. Japanese releases of Pokemon. * Takes japanese input from a desktop computer * Simple user interface, rather than gamified like Typing of the Dead  Is my best bet a custom Anki deck? ||||| Is there any reason not to use anki?  ||||| I'm using [URL] and I absolutely love it.

Sometimes their withdrawal transaction queue can be slow, and if you haven't generated a new deposit address, it is using their old wallet which is very slow. But you'll get your coins back. ||||| Once they arive at Cryptsy just move them forward to the right address.

Anybody who takes abilify knows that the stuff is expensive. Since I don't have insurance I've been stretching out my meds as long as possible, dreading what the grand total would be. It was pretty common for me to pay $200 a script with insurance.   So, without insurance it came to $325. The pharmacist saw that and was shocked. She took my meds in the back and whatever she did, when she came back, all three of my meds came out to $16. She saved me over $300! It's small, but it definitely made my day. I had been worrying all week about how I was going to make ends meet with this paycheck after meds.  ||||| I love these stories. You should send that woman a thank-you note! There are some really great people in the world. $325 is a horrendous amount of money to pay for meds, especially for a young person.  ||||| I'm guessing she ran it through the company's discount card. It's pretty awesome :D source: pharmacy tech  ||||| Well I applaud your commitment to your treatment!  I have a hard time actually going to appts.  and actually going to pick up my meds...they don't cost me nearly that much but I seriously have to say fuck a $300 med bill if my kids won't eat because of it.  I think mental health should be treated as a human right.  It should be provided, I think more than half the people with compliance issues would do what they need to if it wasn't so hard.  I would.  I also whine a lot...sorry bout that. ||||| She sounds like a beautiful person. :] ||||| Wow. I live in Australia and my meds never cost near that much! I get a welfare "low income" concession card, and with that concession, my anti-depressants have cost me *nothing* the past two times, and my mood stabilisers were about $4 for a two week supply when I got them today.  That pharmacist sounds lovely! I agree with writing her a thank you note!  One of my nice pharmacist encounters was when I lost my antidepressants prescription and ran out. I went two days without them, and ended up at the chemist with withdrawal symptoms. I explained what was happening, they saw that I had previously had the script filled, gave me a few days worth of meds, and told me to come back in on the Monday with a prescription to get the rest of the box. They made me pay the full, non-concessional price that day, but I got it refunded when I came in next to collect the rest.  I have definitely gathered a newfound respect for pharmacists in the past year. They're a godsend. ||||| Wow. My meds recently cost £116 and the pharmacist knocked it down to £100. And I thought that was great! ||||| The injectable abilify and brexpiprazole have patient assistance programs.

2887	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	21	We went to a chinese buffet yesterday for dinner and I got my 6 month old a plate and put a couple of peaches and melon. Then I saw some avacodo and I figured since she's had it at home it would be okay. Get back to the table, give her a tiny spoonful, and she makes the worst face. Her eyes start turning red and her face is getting reddish. I'm like WTF?! My husband say's "did you taste that before you gave it to her?" No. I didn't. I broke probably the number one rule of feeding your baby. So I tasted it and hot damn! It was spicy :( The waitress walks by and I ask her what it is and she says "Wasabi, Spicy!".   My poor girl. I wanted to cry. Not to mention last week we got her stuck in a pumpkin. Which I immediately, in panic mode, grabbed a knife to carve her out and my husband flipped and thought I was going to cut her. I am not a smart lady.

Don't feel bad at all, this is hilarious. I did one better than you at a restaurant anyway. I gave her mashed potatoes that were nuclear hot and she jammed her fist right into them. She screeeeeamed and I swear everyone was looking at me like  I was a child abuser. Once she stopped crying, I cried. A lot. Her hand was pink but she was fine and happily ate her lunch when it was cool enough.  ||||| Ok, I know laughing is probably not the appropriate response but I can't help it! That picture of her in the pumpkin is absolutely adorable, and imaging you carving her out is hilarious. Lol! Great photos! I kind of want to try this now. ||||| Stuck in a pumpkin is adorable! ||||| Oh my goodness she's adorable! ||||| Omg she has a cute smile! *melt* ||||| I feel terrible for laughing, but damn honey, that is super hilarious!

5666	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	12	[deleted] ||||| If you make this project a priority in your life and feel passionate enough about this design to stick with such a challenging lace project for a lengthy amount of time, I would say go for it!  As far as purchasing lace weight yarn. I would look into the following online retailers:   [Imagiknit]([URL]  [The Loopy Ewe]([URL]  [Churchmouse Yarns and Teas]([URL]  [Jimmy Beans Wool]([URL]  [Purl Soho]([URL]  ...to name just a few of my favorite "luxury" yarn dealers. This will be the most likely place to find high-quality lace weight yarn suitable for an heirloom piece such as your shawl. As far as time estimates, this is highly subjective as everyone's speed and ability varies. Personally, I estimate this would take me 2-3 months of steady work to accomplish this project but I am quite experienced.    Edit: **Tip:** [Lifelines.]([URL] They are your best friend.  ||||| Honestly, I think 6 months is probably enough time, BUT you have to  make sure that you don't procrastinate on it and be all "I have tons of time" about it. If it takes you only 2 months, but the first 2 months, that's great, you can do other stuff!  You might want to estimate your time at the beginning though, so once you get your yarn, cast on knit a few rounds, then weigh the ball of yarn you're knitting with. (order a digital kitchen scale if you don't already have one. I use [this one]([URL] and really like it) Then, set a timer and knit for 1 hour. Then weigh your yarn again to find out how much yarn you used in that time. From there you can see that if you were able to knit 2g of yarn in an hour, and the 1800yds of yarn weighs ~205g (this is based on the yarn called for in the pattern, your yarn might be slightly heavier or lighter) you'll know that you need about 102.5 hours to complete the project, and you can set daily or weekly knitting time goals as necessary (I really recommend setting your goal to finish at least 3-4 weeks early, to give yourself a buffer for mistakes or life events that impact your knitting time, and to get it blocked).   ||||| Some shops give quantity discounts.  Yarn.com (Webs) discounts nonclearance yarn. Mr.Yarn (a small but very nice online shop) discounts, as does Fabulous Yarns.  Both of these carry almost only luxury yarns and have very nice service.  If you don't mind spending a little money on learning.  Craftsy has a good video class on Mastering Lace Shawls that could save you a lot of heartache down the line.  Good luck! ||||| Wow,  a LYS that makes all their own yarn?!   That's a new concept to me!   What a fun resource.  As a spinner,  expect handmade yarn to be like anything else,  perhaps a little more full of character.   It won't have perfect uniformity that mass produced yarn is supposed to have,  but you need a small enough amount that the dye lot should all be the same.  As far as the shawl... I won't tell you to NOT do it,  but I will advise that I think your goals are quite lofty if you've had no experience with lace knitting.   I believe you can do it,  but it'll just take some dedication: maybe setting weekly stitch/round completion goals via an Excel spreadsheet to keep on track,  making judicious use of lifelines and stitch markers to alleviate any issues with incorrect stitches.   I've done lace before and I enjoy it,  but I felt like there was a learning curve to doing it before I really got comfortable enough to be fast about it.  ||||| There are reclaimed yarn stores on etsy that sell nice stuff at a ridiculous price |||||  I say go for it! Be patient and learn how to put a lifeline in your knitting, so you can fix any mistakes easily.   Not sure if it's available where you are, but DROPS makes a alpaca-silk blend lace weight yarn that's very affordable for what it is. They are about 800m per skein, so you would need only 2-3 skeins.   You could also try a shetland lace weight wool yarn - they were made for shawls such as the one you are going to knit. I just saw an interesting clip on traditional shetland knitting, and Jamieson and Smith makes yarns that come very close to the original handspun yarns. [Link to the video,14min]([URL]

It's not completely dead yet, but the fan is starting to grind and get really loud. Dust, I'm sure. I'd rather not be dead in the water for two weeks.   I want to head this whole thing off and get a new supply before this one gives out for whatever reason.

Suspect though you will be charged $35 but you can't obviously send one in because you don't have it.  I'm sure it will work out. ||||| I went through the steps of placing an order for a "spare" power supply. I saw the order change to a $35 charge, as instructed by the chat support person, who I was chatting with while placing the order. I registered my console which is still under warranty. The rep said as long as it's under warranty you can get a "spare".  I was led to believe that this would allow me to purchase a spare power supply, without having to send in a replacement.  I got an email after the order was placed saying I needed to send in the non-working power supply. I ignored this as the chat rep said this was ok.  Fast foward to the next week and I inquired about my order and the chat rep said as long as I had paid (my card was also charged immediately after the order) I would receive a power supply.  Fast forward to the week after that, same story and I was told it takes a couple weeks for the power supply to be shipped and I would receive a shipping notification.  Fast forward to today and now I'm told the order I placed was for an exchange, not a purchase. The chat rep had to cancel my previous order and place a new one.  Moral of the story, call in to explain so the rep understands your needs. ||||| If you registered your Xbox One, then you can order an official power supply through the [Xbox Online Service Center]([URL] for $35 (Canadian).

7508	1,3	5	Well it has been a year since "D-day" and it seems I can't get her out of my life and move on. 22/m vs 20/f.   Backstory: High school sweethearts, dating consistently for 5 years, did everything together, frequently introduced as, "the bible says Adam and Eve, it's really Girl and Boy" because everyone saw us to be extremely compatible. Towards the end her mother started passing away. She started to abuse Weed and Booze to the point to where she was never sober, even wake up every few hours to take a hit or do some shots. I told her that this isn't the right way as she started to abuse me. We went to a rave one December and she went the next day. I declined to go, but a "friend" of myn went with her. She was doing double shots all night and lost my necklace and ended up cheating on me with my "friend" (concurrent story: said friend used to LIVE WITH ME FOR 2 YEARS I PAID HIS RENT, BOUGHT HIS FOOD, BATHED AND CLOTHED THIS @%#$ STAIN; I told him my intentions were to get back with Girl to not do sexual things with her but to be a friend, what a slap in my face! P.S TL if your reading this kindly go die.) She ended up dating my friend for a year. My family hangs out with girls family every weekend and refuse to honor my wishes and part. I gave my ex another chance, to which she says she needs to be single to "figure out things". I'm done waiting. I want to be over this.  Things I've done to try and forget: 7 rounds with tequila, 20 bottle beer challenge, flew to Nepal and stayed for two weeks, spent a week in the desert in California, went to a beach in Florida for a week. Many many many nights in clubs and bars. Buried my nose in my college studies (last semester and I'm DONE.) Attempted relations with 5 different women all fell through because I cannot get Girl outta my life. I EVEN SHAVED MY BEARD to try n forget... (P.s I miss you beard.)   TL;DR 5 year relationship ended started to crumble with death of her mother, she cheated, parents of both party still active with each other, see/hear of her every other day, been around the world from London to the bay (go hammer?) Had other relationships, shaved my beard, still not over her.  Question: Help.. I am about to goto therapy.. ||||| Write her a bunch of letters (or just one to try it out) that she'll never read.

6581	1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3	22	so [Juniper and Aruba] ([URL] have decided on a joint venture around wireless using juniper switches for the connection on the back end.  Any of you guys in the enterprise/K-12/Higher ed spaces have any dealings with Juniper or Aruba right now?  Before this announcement I was actually very deep into a design around a Juniper wireless deployment for my campus now that its basically an Aruba deployment (I think can't confirm yet) I'm not sure I want anything to do with it anymore and I'm just looking for some community input.   thanks in advance   EDIT: Thanks for all the feed back guys its much appreciated and the venting helps at least :) ||||| Sounds like Juniper has finally realised that it's own wireless products (that it bought-in from Trapeze I think) don't have a good reputation, have very little market penetration and are outside of its core business anyway. So rather than throwing huge amounts of money at them to fix the issues they're going to let it die a natural death while pushing Aruba. I could be wrong about this but that's what it smells like to me.  If you've bought a load of Juniper-brand wireless kit then you'd have a right to be pissed off. Saying that, I've yet to meet a user of Juniper wireless kit that doesn't think it sucks.   Vendors deciding that there own-brand products are futile and deciding to let them die in favour of cross-promoting third-party products is nothing new though. We've got a couple of the Cisco ACE load-balancers that are now EOL and Cisco offers no upgrade path other than pointing us towards Citrix.  ||||| Why would you not want Aruba?  They're definitely a leader in wireless.  I'm personally a Cisco WiFi fan, but Aruba would be my 2nd choice.   ||||| We have Aruba in all our schools and have really liked it. The instant APs are a breeze to setup and keep the cost down of needing controllers. ||||| From what I've heard (just grapevine stuff from people deep into vendor relationships) Juniper is about to dedicate itself fully to SP core and a bit of enterprise and call its wireless, firewall, and security products days gone by and sell them off to whoever will pay for it.  So that'd be one chalked up in favor of that rumor. ||||| We've been running the Juniper Wireless products for over a year. They have been somewhere between mediocre and terrible, depending on the day of the week. This is probably because juniper did their typical routine of acquiring a company and failing to properly integrate or improve their newly acquired product line.  They are just now getting the proper integration with Junos Space down, but it isn't ready to replace the aging RingMaster application, which is extremely buggy and dated.  We have also had numerous bugs with APs randomly crashing/rebooting, as well as APs taking over an hour to boot on initial deployment in some extreme cases. Juniper sent one of their top level Wireless guys (a former Trapeze employee) and they were unable to pinpoint it.  Also, since day 1, we have been having issues with lost connectivity to clients. JTAC was unable to find a definitive solution other than suggesting a code upgrade and re-surveying the site.   TL;DR - Have not been pleased with the Juniper wireless portfolio and I welcome the new Aruba overlords. ||||| I hadn't heard of the Juniper and Aruba partnership until now. I was however aware of the Brocade - Aruba partnership, a similar endeavor.   [Link]([URL] ||||| This isn't anything new. Aruba already has a similiar partnership with Brocade, as they are getting out of the wireless business all together, as well.  ||||| This is one of the best things Juniper could have done.  I'm already a Aruba Networks customer, and will be into the foreseeable future.  It's unfortunately a day late and a dollar short as I just invested in a Brocade core network that I just installed 2 weeks ago.  With Aruba, I use everything from their edge switches, to tunnel node, to wireless, to Clearpass, to their RAP's.  It's definitely a bonus for Juniper.

Seems like it would work out for everyone- the town gets a competent doctor, and Victor can be at peace. ||||| I think he was drinking heavily because he didn't know what to do. Perhaps he felt that he didn't deserve to forget everything, or that he wanted to kill himself but felt some sort of responsibility to the town, as he is the only doctor. Long story short, he was really confused.  However along comes a complete stranger that needs his help. He was already in a bad place *then* the cracked watch reminds him of his brother.

I was glad that Henry pointed out that he wasn't in the book though. ||||| Maybe it was more like. The life's he took for his own? Like he felt he should die for the punishment of the pain he has caused  ||||| Maybe it was written that way because it would be easier for Ruby to catch him from jumping in the ocean than crossing the line. Or maybe he just no longer wanted to be alive because of everything he'd done; he didn't just want to forget the mistakes of his past. ||||| I was thinking the same thing, thought that's where he was headed. ||||| Probably not the best option considering there's magic and crazy stuff at storybrooke.

I have Attunement=8, Faith=9, Intelligence=10 but as expected with the Warrior class, my Str, Dex, Endurance, and resistance are pretty nice at 15, 15, 14 and 13.   My question is: Is it worth upgrading Attunement, Faith and Intelligence at this stage or can it wait until I actually have some magic to use those things? ||||| It depends on what you want to do. You won't have access to the basic pyromancies or sorceries until later on so there's really no need.  It's also completely viable not to use magic at all in a playthrough. It just depends on what you really want to do or what you think will benefit you later.   ||||| Early on, I think you should put most of your points into Vitality and Endurance. Use points in  Strength and Dex as needed for equipment.  Later, raise Attunement and either Intelligence or Faith if you'd like to use sorcery or miracles.  You don't have to raise anything to use Pyromancy on the side. The damage is not increased by any stats. If you find you like Pyromancy, you can raise Attunement for more spell slots.  |||||  >I'm a level 15 and right now it costs about 1445 per point to upgrade my stats...  Right now. The cost to upgrade increases every time you upgrade.   ||||| If you're planning on upping Attunement, Faith and Intelligence then it's not really a warrior build now is it?

4014	1,2,3	4	Quite honestly the images I witnessed will never leave my mind.  In the middle of my work day I'll find myself thinking about what I saw and not about what I was working on.    If you notice, the story by the Greencastle newspaper has an email address where you can offer adoption assistance and financial assistance to the rescue who is having to perform multiple surgeries to the 70+ dogs they rescued.  Please contact them if you are able to offer any assistance.    [URL]  [URL] ||||| have you done a puppy mill bust before?  if so, why was this one the worst? ||||| The news articles said 64 and 67 dogs, not 70+. I don't like neglected dogs, but I also don't like inaccuracy in reporting.  Also, what are these surgeries for? One article mentioned spay/neuter surgeries. No offense, but I absolutely *do not* condone spay/neutering animals BEFORE this woman goes to trial. The dogs were seized due to lack of water from a broken water pipe, NOT due to conditions. Both articles specifically stated the dogs were able to be removed due to lack of water.   I absolutely cannot support or advocate going in and spay/neutering someone else's dogs because they didn't have water -- particularly since you cannot possibly determine how long the dogs were without water. Also, there has been ZERO veterinary treatment of these dogs, just speculation on health conditions. Who determines how thin is too thin? Who determines if pads were burnt from living in gross conditions?   I don't like commercial breeding. But damn, it is not acceptable to just swoop in and fix all the dogs BEFORE any convictions are made. These dogs are NOT the property of the rescue group and they should NOT be altered because the group thinks it is right or because this is a commercial breeding facility. I know people don't like this fact: but individuals who receive the proper licensing are completely within their rights to breed dogs for profit. It is not acceptable to sabotage their business because you don't agree with breeding dogs for profit. If this woman is NOT convicted of animal cruelty and/or her dogs aren't removed from her by law, then what is she going to do with 64-67 altered animals? You might not LIKE her choices, but it is not okay to impose your beliefs before the justice system even has a chance to review the case.  I am genuinely concerned by the number of groups who think it is okay to seize dogs and immediately spay/neuter. THESE ARE NOT YOUR DOGS. These are someone else's dogs. When they are relinquished to the group via court order or the owner's willingness to give them up, THEN you can spay/neuter them.   I hate commercial breeding as much as the next person, but I will never find it acceptable to step on the rights of people. Let her have her day in court *first*, then proceed from there.

The thing is, potatoes are my *obsession.* Fries, tots, hashbrowns, baked, scalloped...you name, I would destroy it.  He ate not even half of the box, and usually I'd finish them off after eating my own large fry, but today? Today I ignored everything in my body that screamed FINISH HIM in a Mortal Combat voice.

7480	1,3,3,3,3	9	I found out my friend(25M) is gay couples months ago. It was never obvious but he always gives this kind of vibes and I was sure of it when he carelessly used my youtube account and I accidentally found watch history is full of gay related videos. Now, I am totally cool with it, I'm a bisexual female myself, no romantic feelings, he's always been like a brother to me. The thing is, I'm so afraid i would slip one of these days. I know his sisters very well and they suspect him, too. I actually almost slipped once when a mutual friend talked about him not having a girlfriend and I said something without thinking like "well, he's gay" luckily everyone thought it was a joke. I know very well that this is his secret and he will have to decide for himself how and when to come out, or not come out at all. But I don't know if I should tell him that I know he's gay or not. It might make him feel better about himself. I don't know. ||||| Tough one, but I would go with not really. I would keep it to yourself, as a secret of your own. Those are the best secrets.  You would only end up making things complicated if you mentioned it to him. And he may not even be homosexual, and which would be embarrassing on your part.   However, with regards to slipping, just don't exercise thought on it, don't feel you have to tell anyone and just carry it as a happy secret and continue with what you're doing now. You've confirmed your suspicions now it's just a matter of the waiting game.  If he discovers he's homosexual he will need a friend and who's better then someone close like yourself. Even better, you mention your bi-sexual too, that will ease him to know that he's not the only one.  However on the other hand, if you end up and see him getting hung up on the whole issue, there may be a time where you need to bluntly tell him that he's homosexual and thats ok. But I wouldn't worry about this until later on. You'll know when it's the right time to say something. ||||| Coming out is a very personal and intimet thing.  Your sexuality should be yours to disclose.  The fact is, you don't know he's gay.  He might be bi, or even just bi curious.  He may or may not be OK with his own sexuality and someone else coming into that very personal space, uninvited, might not be helpful.  Even if you have the best of intentions.  ||||| Anytime a friend of yours talks about another friend behind their back, even with a little comment, you should ask yourself why it's necessary to add to it.   It's really none of anyone's business.   And TBH you really don't know anything. Unless that persons tells you I mean.  If the same person converted to a particular religion would you "out them" too? Just focus on you. Leave that person to their life and they'll tell you what they want if they choose to. You want to tell them what you *think* you know, so you can be the good person who's basically saying "*its ok with me*". If you're a good friend they won't need your validation or approval, and they already should know it's ok.  ||||| Do NOT call him out this is way to sensitive. And you will let it come out? How, to him? To his friends? Which would be awful, btw. Maybe he knows and feels it's not your business. You should worry more about yourself instead of trying to "out" your friend so he can "feel better about himself". Wtf?
7565	1,2,3,3,3,3	15	hey -   I don't know how many of you use Blazersedge.com (it's a good site for Blazer news, local writing, etc), but lately it seems the Blazers' woes have started affecting the staff.  I had my years-old account banned without explanation other than "ad hominem" attacks. When I wrote in to ask why, and even list some possible reasons why, I didn't get a reply.  When my roommate decided to make an account so at least one of us could comment, they banned it too, thinking it was me making a new account.  Since they don't respond to emails, I'd just like to throw out there that there are probably comments and posts that just... vanish. And there's no way to find out why. I know I'm pissed every time I hear reddit mods are taking stuff off, and so I thought I might give a heads up that your posts on there may get deleted if they have any twinge of negativity. An example of posts my friend thinks got me banned:  - After a recap that included "PRAAIISE JAYYSUS," and a subsequent comment about Christians being offended by that line, I added that Christians "weren't really known for their critical thinking skills." Just sayin, I didn't start it...  - A comment about the new videos being "lame," that they could be better, but needed work. - Comments about how the quality of the writing declined during the Blazers weeks-long slide.... they even alluded to the fact that the recap would be really short. Which is a long time to go without a decent recap for those who didn't catch the game.  All of these comments were deleted within a few minutes of posting... I know, them's fightin' words! But seriously, you'd have to have skin thinner than nori seaweed to ban a dude for that. Anyways, just a heads up... maybe I'm so used to reddit and actually being able to say things without fear of someone removing it that I'm insulated from how the rest of the Internet works. Anyways... go blazers!  EDIT: I want to be clear: Blazersedge is a great site. Their writing is really, really good, the coverage is great. I think everyone here should check them out.

7061	1,3,2,3,3,3	17	There's a place called Corrados where I lived. It's kinda like a big farmers market where the produce is cheap and fresh.

EDIT- I totally noticed how I worded the title hahaha  ||||| If your budget is really tight, try Aldi at 46th and Market- it is very cheap (it's owned by the parent company that owns Trader Joe's) and is much better than the similar discount store, Save a Lot.    Supreme Shop n Bag at 43rd and walnut has cheap staples but avoid produce and meat there.  There are veggie/fruit trucks right outside Supreme which have great prices on produce.  For meat, take a trip to Reading Terminal Market or the 9th street Italian Market (Cannuli's and Esposito's are great).  For Indian / Asian staples, try Rice&Spice (42nd & Chestnut) or International Foods (42nd and Walnut).  Forget Fresh Grocer at 40th and Market.  Total rip-off.  Farmer's Market in Clark Park (Thurs, Sat) is decent, not really cheap though.  Good Luck! ||||| When ya moving, again? ||||| Produce Junctions is great for fruits and veggies. They do not do meats or cheese though. Aldi's is great on a budget and Trader Joes is great if you have some money to spend, but is still cheaper than whole foods. ||||| Reading Terminal Market ||||| Whoever suggested Reading Terminal must've never actually had to pay for anything there.....its not cheap.  I would go straight for Trader Joe's at 21st and Market.  Its close to drive and free parking sundays; if you can't drive the bus goes up and down market st.  You can get ALL of your shopping done around 100-150.  By these I mean approx. a months worth of food ie. frozen veggies, fresh fruit and vegs, dairy/milk/cheese, bread and meats.  
2588	1,3	4	For background (and to ensure everyone that I'm not entirely full of it) I'm an Engineering student specializing in Structural Engineering. I was thinking about the implications of gravitational waves and the fact that they exist makes me think that space-time and matter are two entirely different things that interact with each other--that matter and energy merely influence deformations in space-time and past that have no true interaction with it. This is somewhat analogous, in my opinion, to structural mechanics.  It seems to me as though the bending of space-time due to mass/energy is similar to a bar of concrete or steel yielding in response to physical or thermal stresses.  So my question is--should my intuition satisfy reality to a certain extent--what exactly is the relationship between the bending of space and time and mass-energy? I know that Energy is related to mass via c2, and that there are likely some considerable complications from the puzzling nature of time, but does a general relationship between the two (or four I guess) exist? If so, what is it?  ||||| The relationship between the bending of space-time and mass-energy, as you say, is that the Ricci tensor minus its trace times the metric (where the metric is a 4x4 matrix that describes the pythagorean theorem through spacetime and the Ricci tensor is a differential function of the metric) is equal to a constant (8 pi G/c^4 )   times the stress energy tensor, which is an extension of the stress tensor from mechanics.  Spacetime does have elastic (and viscous) properties, which are manifested as gravitational radiation. I'm not sure you can easily ascribe a modulus to it, but the shear induced by a change in the distribution of mass is proportional to the second time derivative of the moment of inertia.
6476	1,3,3,3,3,3,3	17	They had perhaps the most ideal director for Black Panther, coming off her critically acclaimed work Selma. She has the talent and mind to explore Marvel's first colored hero and his rich culture. I believe her taking some liberties would have been totally fair based on how Marvel has deviated from the source material in recent movies; I'm just wondering what kind of creative differences they must have came across for her to not win the job. I feel like this is a huge opportunity missed by Marvel; Black Panther, helmed by DeVurnay, could have had the potential to be seriously groundbreaking.

Marvel didn't pass on her.  ||||| To quote her " I think I’ll just say we had different ideas about what the story would be". Her vision of Black Panther story most likely was so distant from what Marvel wanted it to be that she decided to pass on the project.  ||||| That's the thing. Marvel doesn't want groundbreaking...they want control over everything because Disney wants control over everything. Ava would have worked wonders but this inevitable clash was going to happen sooner or later.

5447	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	32	So as we expected, there is still no heartbeat and no fetal pole. My dr expects me to miscarry within the week. If I don't miscarry by tomorrow afternoon, then I go back for another check and then I will either schedule a d&c or get the prescription for the pill.  My husband is taking it really hard. He's been depressed for the past week, although we've been communicating very well to each other how we feel about it. He was so happy to finally have the chance to be a dad, and to go from that high to such a drastic low has been difficult for him. I was down for a few days, but I've taken it in stride because I knew the risks, and I plan for us to go to counseling together to work through it.  I told my mom this morning. She was pretty upset. I haven't been on great terms with my dad, but I'm going to tell him tonight. The thing I'm worried about is that they are extrememly religious, and my mom has already expressed her disdain for the pill (although really, there's no heartbeat and no baby, so it shouldn't matter). I really don't want this decision to make things worse with my relationship with them.  Does anyone have suggestions on which route I should go if I don't miscarry naturally? I was thinking the pill, because there is a small risk of scarring with d&c and I don't want to risk future pregnancies. But I have heard that the pill can be painful and there will be a lot of bleeding (which I would probably be ok with, but the pain scares me).  EDIT: I talked to my mom again and told her that I was planning on calling my dad. I told her that I had thought about it, and I really didn't think that my decision on how to deal with the miscarriage should be an issue that should be discussed between her and my dad. She said she had also thought about it and agreed, and she had no plans to bring it up again. So that's a big relief that I don't need to have that conversation again. I did tell my dad about the fact that I'm pregnant but going to miscarry, and he was sympathetic and understanding. It actually seems like we're on better terms now, so hopefully that trend will continue. Thanks to everyone for your words of encouragement. :) ||||| When I miscarried I opted for the D&C. I was supposed to be 15 weeks pregnant by the time I had the D&C and I couldn't stand the thought of miscarrying at home, that itself was too much for me. I had the D&C at the hospital under anesthesia.  I was, and am still, happy with that choice, they were also able to take the fetus and test it to find out why it died, which I thought was a good idea as we were, and are doing IVF.That's how we found out the baby had Turner Syndrome.  My suggestion would be to do what you think is best. I know that's crappy advice, but for me one option seemed the best for me from the beginning. Good luck, and I'm sorry you have to make this choice. ||||| I am so sorry for your loss. I hope you and your husband will be able to work through the pain together and you will be able to continue your quest for a baby. About your parents, I wouldn't even tell them about the choice between the pill and the D&C. It's not their decision to make or influence. This is your body, you need to do what's best for you, your sanity and health. There shouldn't be a religious discussion.  Good luck. ||||| I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. I am really impressed with how you and your husband are communicating, though. We sure failed at that a lot in the beginning.  I have had both a d&c and the pills. Neither were fun. I thought the d&c was harder. I expected it to be all done once I had it, but I bled a ton afterward for a long time.  The pills are hard on the day you take them (like a handful of pills for me, no joke), but it was more like a regular miscarriage, and less disorienting to me.  With the D&C, you might have to wait a while to try again for physical healing. With the pills, you have to be really gentle with your stomach lining for a few weeks (no vitamins, even), and you should ask your doctor about how long you might have to wait.  All of the options are unfun, but at least you have options, and whatever you pick is a healthy choice.  As for the religious nonsense, you need to protect yourself from that. Maybe you can just load your mom up with more constructive stuff to do (Mom, we're a mess. You know what might help? If you made us a lasagna) to get her off your back? ||||| Here's an option...  It's not an honest one but it might work for you.  Just tell your parents that you were going to take the pill but you started to miscarriage on your own.  They'll think that their prayers worked and you won't have to deal with any crap.  I'm not a huge advocate of lying but at a time like this, you really don't need the stress of others pushing you and judging your choices.  Also, I am so sorry for your loss. ||||| I had the same thing happen to me last year. The one other thing that my dr warned me about the pill or miscarring naturally was the chance of a hemorrage. I chose the d&c. Just do the pros and cons about the pill and the d&c. Idk how much is the d&c because my insurance paid for it. And honestly it shouldn't matter what your parents say, it's your body but i agree with the previous comment, you perhaps need to lie. Good luck, dont lose faith, i know its hard but our time will come to be parents and we will be the best ones!!!  ||||| I'm so sorry you're going through this and that your parents are causing even more stress :(  I second just keeping them out of your decision making process.   I hope the counselling helps you and your husband.  ||||| I can't comment on the pill vs D&C as I've never had experience with either, but I wanted to say that I am sorry for your loss. I wish you and your husband the best as you heal from the experience.  ||||| I'm so sorry you're going through this. :( ||||| Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear this.  :(. It makes me so sad anyone has to go through this.  ||||| Oh, honey.  So sorry. I've had this experience myself, and the miscarrying started on its own.  I just want to echo everyone else and say, keep the medical details between you and your husband and leave your parents out of the decision. Honestly, if its all the same TO YOU and your husband, natural miscarriage, pills, or a D&C, then that's what matters. Whichever route you go, just tell her "my miscarriage started today," and that's all she needs to know.  ||||| I feel you with the religious parents.  I have in-laws who (thankfully) most of the time keep their negative opinions re: IVF to themselves, but nonetheless, I know they think what we're doing is morally wrong.  It's not something to add to your list of worries; this is YOUR life and YOUR decision.  They will deal. I can only imagine the heartache you and your husband must be feeling right now, as I haven't reached the ultrasound stage of a pregnancy yet.  To go through so much and think its worked, only to have it ripped away- I am so very sorry.  Take all the Internet hugs I have to give.   ||||| That sucks. Going from your highest high to your lowest low is so exhausting. Husband and I have been sleeping like 12 hours a day this week, trying to avoid life. I hope your husband is okay.

5498	1,3,3,3,3,3	15	So, I've owned this iPod for less then 7 months but I got it online from some random amazon seller, I still have the receipt they sent when it was delivered.  Anyways around last month I noticed the battery being drained alot faster, (on 4.2.1). I let it die completely then recharged it to see if there would be a difference, but didn't notice any.  And around 3 days ago my home button became stuck and I have a difficulty pushing it without adding alot of force, spring came loose or something!!?  So, how I would go about getting a replacement for this? I didn't buy it through apple, I'm I screwed? ||||| I just read the [iPhone 4 warranty]([URL] and cannot find any stipulation that it must be purchased from a specific/authorized retailer, distributor, or merchant in order to qualify for warranty service.  I'm a little suspicious of this being too-good-to-be-true, as normally there would be some provision about transferability, and I cannot find that either.  But going by the information that Apple are providing in their one year warranty plan, you do qualify and should contact them ASAP.  The contact information by region is located [[URL] ||||| If you have an Apple store near you set up an appointment and bring it in.  It's one of the few places with really great customer service.  On a side note I don't think you're supposed to drain the batteries to empty.  I think that actually reduces the battery life.    You may want to also check and see if you have a bunch of applications open.  You can do that by double tapping the home button and it should bring up all your open apps at the bottom.  Double tap there to get them into that wiggly state and close them. ||||| TL;DR updating iTunes and firmware to newest versions fixed battery drain on wife's 2g iPod.  that sucks about the home screen button. however, my wife had the same battery draining problem on her itouch2g and it also changed her time on her randomly so calendar reminders were useless. I suggested she update iTunes and update firmware to newest version. solved both of her problems. battery went from less than 24h life (even with no usage!) to ~2-3 days of light to medium use. hope that helps your battery problem. hers was roughly around 8 months too when battery started acting up while she was using an older firmware version. ||||| Try updating to the newest version of iOS, which would be 4.3.5 for the iPod (I'm assuming Touch).  That's the first thing the Genius bar will do and then send you on your way and tell you to come back another day if you still continue to have problems. ||||| Go on apples website and register your product with them using the serial number. Then you should be all set to get warranty service at the apple store.

1811	1,3,3,3	11	So, what do you guys think has happened? We can see from the last line that Rose now has a physical form in 'our' world. We know that Blake's connections to the people outside have been severed by the entropy demon.   Do you think Blake is alive? If not, what happens next? If so, same question.   I think Blake is alive, but since the connections have been severed whatever outside magical force Grandma Thorburn created perceived him as dead and therefore manifested Rose's physical form.   I predict Blake will return later, having captured the demon off-screen somehow. I would not be surprised if he used the form the captured demon takes an his implement and achieves a massive power boost because of it. I'm still assuming (like I have been since the third arc or so) that the final conflict of the series will be Blake v. Rose. ||||| The fact the Evan has not moved on and it never explicitly says Blake is eaten only he 'didn’t make it'  is evidence that Blake will be returning to the story at some point.   However, the fact that Rose is now in the physical world means that whatever Ur did triggered the line of succession.   I agree that Blake v. Rose will be the final showdown. There is no better opponent than and evil copy of yourself.    On an unrelated note, are the Behaim now without protection from the barber since Laird got shanked.? ||||| I see three major possibilities:  1) Blake is dead-dead. This completes the prophecy that he would die in a completely straightforward way. His death was never outright stated, which makes me think that he's not actually dead-dead (and I consider it a bit unsatisfying anyway, but that could be the point).  2) Blake is "dead" by virtue of having no connections to anyone else, but otherwise escapes unharmed. For somebody who depends so heavily on his close circle of intimate friends, this is a severe thing. He might come back in the story, but he's unlikely to be a big player either way. This is also unlikely, though not impossible.  3) Blake is alive, but no longer Blake. This is my preferred outcome. Either through some manipulation by ErasUr, possession by other forces, or giving in to the lawyers, Blake is not a good guy any more. He isn't necessarily a bad guy, but he's not going to be *fighting* demons. The biggest problem with this is that it doesn't really satisfy his prophesied death (unless the way the prophecy works is less literal).  Note that in all of the encounters with ErasUr Wildbow has made a point to mention that the demon can replicate itself in your eyes (Blake barely purges it the first time he catches a direct sighting). What happens if this occurs? My theory is that ErasUr wants to escape, and that the flammable materials in the warehouse finally allow it to burn down the bindings and/or ride out in his eyes. With no remaining connections his sense of self is going to be more fluid, and that gives an in to all the demons and other nasties out there.  If nothing else, we haven't yet seen what the radiative effect of ErasUr is, beyond perhaps basic decay on workings around it.  In short, I want to see Ur!Blake become the new big bad, but possibly not until the final arc (we need time to establish Rose's solo chops after all). ||||| I have a hard time believing that Blake is dead.  He is a Wildbow protagonist, he is going to survive somehow through some last minute quick thinking or something.   Anyway, I don't think that Rose will become an antagonist or the big bad at the end of the story.  I feel that would be really cliche and I don't think Wildbow would be that predictable.  Can't wait for the next chapter.

4426	1,3,3,3,3	5	I know that if we cut our artery then there will be pressure to gush the blood out.  For waterbags with hole, the harder to squeeze the more rapid the water squirt out  For humans with a wound, no matter how hard you squeeze, the blood oozes out, just maybe a little faster And even so, there is a limit to how much you can squeeze out. How do we know how much blood is supposed to come out?  ||||| Unlike a bag of water, your arm is not a bag of blood.  It is a bag of tissue, with blood flowing through it, through hundreds of tiny little veins.  When you get a cut, it's only slicing through a few of these tiny veins. If the cut is on your finger, you can squeeze all you want, but only the blood very close to the cut is going to come out.   Your body begins clotting the cut immediately to plug up the hole and prevent blood loss, this is why it only bleeds for a short time and stops. ||||| The short answer is that you are less like a water bag and more like a city with flexible water lines.  If a giant comes along and tears a block or of this imaginary blood supplied city it's going to break some residential lines and maybe a branch, but applying pressure or squeezing the area around the wound collapses the lines.  Capillary bleeds have to wait for clotting factors, veins actually have tiny one-way valves in them to help them collapse rapidly when significantly damaged.   Arteries in the limbs can be compressed, and almost always need surgical intervention. Arteries in the abdomen are usually "incompressible" where treatment involves shoving a hand in a person and pretending to be the arterial wall, but no one ever has to do that for too long. ||||| Humans aren't just bags of blood surrounded by skin, so the waterbag analogy doesn't work in this case.  Blood is contained in the body in blood vessels such as veins, arteries and capillaries. Unless you have a serious/deep wound that has severed veins or arteries, most of the blood you'll see has come from ruptured capillaries. Capillaries are super fine blood vessels that supply blood to the skin and don't contain enough blood or pressure to squirt bloody like you describe.  ||||| Well, first, we're not blood bags. We're not just bags full of blood. Our blood is, to an extent, contained. When we have a cut and apply pressure to it, two things happen: we block the flow of blood, and by blocking that flow, we cause the blood to stop moving, allowing it time to clot. It is the clotting that actually stops the blood flow.

3792	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3	41	I know a lot of people didn't like the fact that Ornstein came back for round 2 in Dark Souls 2, and I understand why, but why do other things like this get a free pass? Don't get me wrong, I love Patches, the Moonlight Greatsword, "Praise the Sun," etc., but I don't get why those things can come back and people just accept it but when Ornstein comes back everyone gets mad about "fanservice." I thought the fight with the Old Dragonslayer was great personally, and it helped sorta bid towards the origins of Heide.  Really I guess what I'm asking is why does everyone want important, lore-related weapons to come back and even whole characters, but no bosses? ||||| With Patches and the Moonlight its done very tongue in cheek imo. There's no real attempt to make Patches or Moonlight significant in the lore, and they're clearly inside jokes. Whereas I feel that the placement of Ornstein was done more seriously, and was meant to have lore significance. The problem was, he didn't really make sense. It makes even less sense in SotFS, where there's a dragon literally right outside. The "Old Dragonslayer" isn't really doing his job.  I guess people don't mind Patches and Moonlight as much because they're more transparent about being fanservice. Also, it takes away from the number of new boss designs in the game. Especially when its a diminished version of a previous fight. The fight makes you think "Hey, remember that really awesome fight in DS1, well here's a worse version of it". It doesn't help that Dark Souls 2 also re-used the Gargoyles and Sorpioness Najka is very similar to Quelaag. ||||| I think Patches is more Miyazaki-service than fan-service. He just likes using the guy. ||||| It think what actually bugs people, whether they realize it or not, isn't that Ornstein is reused.  It's that he just feels so out of place and misused.  Reusing characters and tropes is a time-honored tradition.  Google comedie de la artes.  Reuse allows storytellers to build a lexicon of meaningful characters and scenarios.  When you see Patches, you instatntly know he is a scoundrel.  But, he's not exactly the same.  Those comparative differences can convey meaningful subtext and interest for the player.  You see less complaints about Patches, gargoyles, et al, because they are integrated into the game in interesting and clever ways.  Ornstein could have come back without any complaint if he didn't just randomly pop up and disappear without any real impact or meaning. ||||| Patches and Moonlight Greatsword aren't fan service at all. They've been in all Souls games. it's kinda like a tradition. The Old Dragonslayer, although I really liked it the first time, it felt really out of place.   Bosses are really hard to return, since in the previous games you kinda kill all of them. ||||| * so far, Patches only appeared in DkS1 in the Dark Souls universe. his appearance in other universes/games doesn't count as there's nothing lore-breaking about it.   * Majestic GS is a sword passed down through several legendary warriors, so is Moonlight GS.  * Praise the Sun, is a gesture done by the sunbros covenant, it's like a religion that doesn't simply fade.  * a lore-critical boss like Ornstein appearing 1000 years or so after his death without an explanation is bullshit. and the kick to the balls is the fact that they made him easy as fuck.  ||||| I'm fine with it if it's done ok, but it feels almost like a disservice to do it in such a hap hazard manner.   The devs wanted to re-use O, so they did.             The devs wanted the Sun Bros, so they slapped it in some random poison wasteland with 0 significance.   They obviously don't want to ignore the popularity of their previous IPs, I just wish that they'd work them in better so they meld with the world rather than stick out like a sore thumb.   ||||| One man's fan service is another man's beloved callback. ||||| Don't even open this can of worms.  I've done it before, by telling people that Patches is just fanservice, and I got torn to shreds for it.  People are just biased.  Miyazaki can reuse bosses, characters, weapons and areas all he likes, but in DkS2 it's obviously just an imitation (duh).  I mean, Lautrec is literally just Yurt under a different name, and people love him.  But then people dismiss Pate as a Patches knockoff even though the two barely have anything in common beyond tricking you and having a spear.  The real answer to your question is that if Miyazaki does it people are reluctant to complain about it, but if anyone else does it then people feel safe to criticize. ||||| Bert was a shitty boss fight without Ernie there to back him up. They thought they were doing something cool but ended up ruining Ornsteins persona ||||| The Moonlight Greatsword is an object that appears in every souls game, sort of like the gas station in every pixar movie or the Hitchcock cameo. As someone said, it's done more as a tribute instead of haivng any real lore significance. Patches is also done tongue in cheek though I do feel he looked stupid in Bloodborne.  I am against Ornstein because there was no lore significance to him. What effect doe she have on the story? It was done as a cheap way to pay 'tribute' to an old character to draw in older fans.  I also feel Solaire's appearance here really broke the atmosphere and was nothing but pure pandering.
1234	1,3,0,3,3,3	20	[empty] ||||| The only realistic approach is to apply existing law of war principles to autonomous drones. The individuals supervising autonomous drones should be liable under the laws of war in the same way as an officer is liable for the actions of those under his command.  War isn't clean. Civilians will die. Combatants that didn't need to will die. Both can happen without it being a crime under the laws of war. There are existing legal principles that define when such casualties move from being just a normal part of war, to being a crime. And also, when it becomes a crime that the commander is responsible for failing to prevent. If a drone screws up in a way that would be a crime for a person, it should be reprogrammed. If the commander fails to take reasonable steps to stop the problem, they become responsible for future occurrences.  The problem is that the advocates, totally divorced from the realities of a real war, want war to be clean and perfect. Something it will never be. Military drones will never be perfect, nor should they be expected to be. ||||| I think this goes the wrong way.

Sword at 3333 HP Which most tanks/bruiser could easily hit with just 2 items like Randuins, Visage, Warmogs, Sunfires, etcetc.    It was a strong item that let HP stackers actually do some damage late game and even be able to duel people with that Crit rate.   It would also be great in this current meta as well (like on Sion and Gnar... but no body likes Gnar because hes a broken piece of crap)   **But most importantly, as mentioned in the title.

Today, that speed wouldn't even qualify you to run in the Boston marathon. What in the world happened?  ||||| Also new training techniques. If you read into it, at the early part of the century training for the marathon was 90% 'go for a long walk' and if you ran too much before doing a marathon your legs would wear out and not have any strength left in them.  They also didn't know much about interval training until much much later.  ||||| Actually, it was 2:58:50 (over a 40 km distance), which is still fairly slow by modern standards.  I imagine that a big part of the reason for improvement is just more people running that sort of distance.  Modern training techniques are also a factor.    In 1950, the top times were under 2:30.  By 1953, they were under 2:20.  More runners with more time to spend on running results in faster times. ||||| More people running leading to faster times because it's more competitive. Far better training methods and research that has gone into it. Better medicine and food with better nutrition that allows for an overall healthier runner. Far better clothing and shoes. There's probably endless reasons, but this is what came to mind first. Basically science happened.  ||||| Just to get an idea, [Gaston Roelants]([URL] a worldclass runner from the earlier 60ies, told in an interview that back then drinking during the marathon (or any sustained effort) was actively adviced AGAINST. Goes to show how much scope for improvement there was.  ||||| The best runners in 1896 would not have been running the marathon in the Olympics. In the 18th and 19th centuries, there were lots of ways to make money running - there are even stories of runners betting the equivalent of $1 million on being able to run a certain time. But the Olympics and official world records were only for amateurs (to help keep money and corruption out). Meanwhile the modern Olympics were brand new at the time and didn't yet have the glory to them that would attract the best athletes.  As I said in another comment, imagine if in 100 years Tough Mudders were the most popular event in the Olympics, and they looked back at the relatively "pedestrian" times that win today. ||||| Everything. Every field of athletics has massive changes. Technology, nutrition, training, understanding of anatomy, you name it. ||||| I personally agree that it's more people doing it. Obvious race tactics and training techniques have made improvements, but getting sponsored and being able to dedicate your life to it is something that just didn't happen 100 years ago.

Every situation where he actually fights Mario he uses robots/mechs, something he keeps doing afterwards in the other games he appears in, and especially his own clown car lately.   It honestly makes sense that he is in the clown car.      In fact... the koopalings DON'T make sense in the clown car, since they never use a personal one, nor do they ever use the shadow mario brush, so i doubt they would have changed anything about Bowser Jr. ||||| Yes, they probably would have been different if it weren't for the Koopalings. I can understand: the Koopalings have a lot of aesthetic appeal with the way they look, so they do make great alt costumes, plus they have a big fanbase. That said, they have virtually zero characterization outside of their looks, and so they'd never be able to get into smash brothers by themselves. The Clown Car was a clever way for Sakurai to allow Bowser Jr. to still be Bowser Jr. while also allowing other people to play as the koopalings, if they wished.   The fact is, Bowser Jr. is still in, and we should be happy about that rather than mad at any potential moveset the koopalings may have robbed. Don't let 'what if's' spoil your favorite character getting in!

And spending a lot more time with the friends who were worth it.  * Working my ass off and getting as many hours at as many stores as I could.  * Buying a plane ticket to Canada and the USA for a few months.

5973	1,3	4	Hi everyone, in my EE undergrad I mostly focused on theoretical topics, such as communications, control and signals processing, and while I loved these topics and I liked they way that they modeled various systems, I knew I wanted more. I wanted a more general understanding, especially towards more complicated systems. I am currently starting my MS in EE, but really I concentrate in mostly theoretical topics with applications in computational neuroscience and biology.   For these reasons, I'm considering quite strongly on doing switching to applied math for my PhD. After all it sounds like I've always been studying applications of math towards engineering to begin with, and I feel that a doctorate in applied math could really help consolidate my understanding of the fundamentals and become familiar to applying them towards a variety of topics. However I also haven't had any research experience yet, and I am aware that much of the math in engineering is rather "dumbed down" compared to actual mathematics programs.  So I'm wondering if anyone could give me some advice... is this a feasible plan? Are there things I can try to do during my MS to strengthen my application, such as taking more mathematically rigorous courses or completing more mathematically inclined research, and how much would this actually do to help?  Thanks a lot everyone!  ||||| I think the answer really boils down to what you want to do with this possible PhD. I was in very much a similar situation to you: I did EE in undergrad but was interested in mathematical\computational biology, so I applied to math\applied math departments and I'm currently working on a PhD in a mathematics department focusing on applied math. Now that I'm here, I'm not 100% sure it was the best decision and I'll share why.  I think one of the biggest issues that scares me right now is jobs, particularly in academia. If you have a higher degree (or even just a BS) in engineering, you have a lot of options whether you want to work in academia or industry. As a result, many of the EE professor jobs are difficult to get, but not impossible. Even if you do math, if you're interested in academia you'll likely end up in a math or applied math department, both of which are extremely saturated right now. It makes sense, though. If you're interested in math and/or have a degree in it, the options career-wise are way less obvious, so pursuing a PhD is much more common. Pursuing something in industry is possible, but again I think it lends itself way less straightforwardly than an engineering degree. One event really illustrated this difference to me: during my senior year at undergrad my school (a tiny liberal arts school) had an opening for a math professor and an EE professor. The EE position had ~200 applicants in the first month posted and the math position had ~2000.   Ultimately, the thing that I would say is that if your reason for considering this is research based, I would say stay in EE. EE research at a high level tends to be very theoretical and often enough, it's not difficult to get into researching a topic even if it isn't necessarily directly related to your field. There's a ton of EEs out there doing research in computational bio/neuro even if it isn't directly related. In fact, I would say EE actually is directly related to neuro, even.   The main deciding factor for me is that I want to teach eventually and I really couldn't imagine teaching engineering classes. So like I said in the first paragraph, what you want to do in the end is really what should drive this decision. If you do still feel like pursuing applied math, I don't think you should be tremendously worried about the application. A lot of the courses in applied math (and even the research) has more of an engineering feel to it than a pure math feel. You'll still need to know some theorem/proof, but it's a lot more things of the flavor of taking Fourier transforms and techniques like that. I hope regardless of what you end up doing it works out for you! If any part of this doesn't make sense, I apologize as I just woke up.

7980	1,0	10	**Phil McNulty has written an article that some unpaid, 14-year-old bloggers would be embarrassed by. Here is where he went wrong. Criticisms in bold**  **Football's mainstream football writers, particularly writers for media outlets that do not solely concentrate on football, are hideously lacking in content, narrative-driven, and amazingly vague.**  Man Utd: Louis van Gaal is 'arrogant, dominant and honest'   **Bad grammar here, it should be 'Louis van Gaal: 'arrogant, dominant and honest''. The way Phil has it implies that Man Utd have said this about Louis van Gaal, which they may have, but I cannot find evidence...anywhere.**  By Phil McNulty **Who?**  While David Moyes often looked like a man who wondered if he was big enough for Manchester United, **subjective, narrative-driven trash with no insight at all** Louis van Gaal is so unburdened by modesty that he may wonder if Manchester United is big enough for him. **Again, subjective, and slighly hyperbolic. No insight here either.**  In a spot of typically measured self-analysis, the 62-year-old, who will assume control at Old Trafford after the Netherlands' World Cup campaign, announced: "I am who I am - confident, arrogant, dominant, honest, hard-working and innovative." Van Gaal is all of those things and more. If United appeared an ill-fitting suit for Moyes **subjective, narrative-driven trash with no insight at all** then this much-travelled **van Gaal has managed in just three countries - two border each other** and well-decorated coach will regard the "Theatre Of Dreams" as tailor-made for his talent and pedigree.  After emerging as a visionary coach with an emphasis on attacking football and youth development at Ajax in the '90s - he won the Champions League in 1995 - he has had had **two hads, for some reason** a magnetic attraction for the biggest clubs with two spells at Barcelona and another at Bayern Munich **One at AZ too, but it doesn't help prove Phil's point**, who he took to the Champions League final in 2010.   **The lasts two paragraphs only show Phil McNulty can use google**  With United swiftly admitting the Moyes experiment had been an abject failure as a good man and decent manager floundered out of his depth **when did United admit this?**, United have cut to the chase **by employing an interim manager and then waiting until the season has finished**. They have gone short-term with a personality and coach who will apply more of a quick fix and will see Old Trafford as perhaps the final destination on a tour of Europe's elite destinations. **What? Is he saying that Louis van Gaal will leave soon? Based on what? Or is he staying van Gaal will stay? I don't get it. Is he referencing his age?**  On almost every level, Van Gaal's appointment represents a significant change from the criteria United applied when bringing in Moyes as successor to Sir Alex Ferguson when he retired after 26 years as manager. **No, no criteria change, United just employed someone who they thought would help them win, as they did with Moyes**  Moyes often seemed grateful United had come to him. **How did Phil McNulty pick this vibe up? He must have seen him in a press conference and thought 'gosh, he looks as though he is grateful United have come to him** Van Gaal will feel no such awe - indeed he may feel exactly the opposite **Not in awe?**. He will believe it is only right that executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward chose someone of his calibre to undertake the great rebuild. **Phil is presupposing what van Gaal will think for some reason, and also, no strong evidence a great rebuild will take place. Honestly, these last 6 paragraphs could just be summarised as 'I think Louis van Gaal is better suited to the United job**  Stalking the touchline with menace, often carrying a clipboard for added impact **and to write things down, but principly menace and impact**, Van Gaal will not shy away from confrontation - if there are cages to be rattled and egos to be rocked at United he will be very comfortable doing the rocking and rolling.  Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano, who worked at one of Van Gaal's former clubs Barcelona, was blunt about his confrontational approach, while at the same time acknowledging his success.  Commenting in March, Soriano said: "If you treat people badly they remember. One day you make an error and they will kill you. I've seen this in many clubs.  "Louis van Gaal has been a very good coach in many clubs but his style is very difficult. The same thing happened to him in Barcelona as in Bayern Munich. "He is very tough, people don't like him but he wins. And one day you won't win - and when you don't win everybody that is angry with you will come back and try to kill you. In the movies this works but in real life it doesn't." **Google, again**  Whereas Moyes seemed to shy away from making the big decisions **selling your title winning captain is shying away, apparently**, giving a title-winning side a chance out of apparent deference and respect as opposed to making the changes required, Van Gaal will have no hesitation in moving on those he feels no longer serve his purpose. **Seems like Moyes did move players out who he felt no longer served a purpose, to be fair**  Van Gaal inherits a squad in need of serious renewal. Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand are going and Patrice Evra looks certain to be replaced by Southampton's Luke Shaw at left-back. **no credible evidence of the Shaw deal**  He will, finally, be the man to tackle the quality deficit that has existed in Manchester United's midfield for years. The names of Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos and Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus are on the radar, while Dortmund defender Mats Hummels has also been linked. **Only one of those is a midfielder, and he plays in the same position as about 9 other superb midfielders that United have**  What will he make, if anything, of United's £27m midfield misfit Marouane Fellaini when everything he has shown so far marks him down as a questionable inheritance for Van Gaal? **the 'if anything' caveat is not necessary. Van Gaal will have to make something of him, given he will work with van Gaal every day**  And what will become of unfulfilled fringe players such as Nani, Ashley Young and Tom Cleverley? Will Danny Welbeck have a part to play? **Patience, Phil. Patience**  Van Gaal will happily promote talented youth so Adnan Januzaj can be expected to get the chance to flourish and build on the precocious quality he has already demonstrated. **Moyes was doing a fine job of that any way, but good point. That's one**  The appointment appears to be good news for United striker Robin van Persie after an injury-troubled season punctuated by suggestions of an uneasy relationship with Moyes and what seemed a dysfunctional partnership with Wayne Rooney. **Disfunctional in what way?** Van Gaal is close to Van Persie, who cherishes such a relationship with his managers. He made him captain of the Dutch national team so it would seem certain he will be pivotal to the new Old Trafford era. **Reasonable point, this article is picking up**  As a man not known for diplomacy, Van Gaal must tread a fine line in this area. It would be a hazardous occupation to be seen as favouring Van Persie over Rooney **even though you Phil, are the only person to suggest this. In this article**, who could hold his head up high as a player who gave everything for Moyes. If Van Gaal is the innovator he believes he is, and his track record suggests, one of his major goals and proving grounds could be to make Van Persie and Rooney a workable football marriage while also finding a role for £37.5m Juan Mata. **Does this require skills of innovation? There are plenty of formations already widespread that could accommodate all three.**   Ryan Giggs, as assistant, provides a link with the past, and someone with experience of how this giant footballing beast works **Probably need to reference Man United here Phil, as people could assume that the giant footballing beast applies to Wayne Rooney**  But from United's point of view, this is not an appointment without risk. Van Gaal's combustible personality takes this out of safe territory. **Yep**  Van Gaal's finest hour was with Ajax in the mid-'90s, although he also took Bayern to the Champions League final four years ago. He has not coached at club level since being sacked by Bayern Munich in 2011. He will, however, undoubtedly have kept his finger on the pulse and will regard the United challenge as his destiny.  When he was linked with a role at Liverpool in 2012 following Kenny Dalglish's sacking he said: "My fingers are itching. I am full of fire and want to work with players."  He will get the chance at Manchester United **To work with football players!? At Manchester United!? Get out of here!** The flame still burns inside one of European football's most enduring and charismatic figures - now can he light the touch paper on a new era of Old Trafford success? **Rhetorical question that should have been answered in this article Phil** ||||| Some of your Criticisms would make an unpaid 14 year old embarrassed.

Are other alternatives that arent the commercial soaps that are better for us. ||||| I realize you're looking for noncommercial products, but after I tried baking soda, etc for a few weeks I just couldn't do it! I'm a woman with long hair and I found the best simple/nontoxic shampoo was Dr. Bronners magic soap. I use it for shampoo, soap and sometimes around the house.  ||||| From personal experience, you need to mess with the ratios a bit. I needed less baking soda and more vinegar. Now my hair is all fluffy and shiny and sooooo soft.  ||||| Vinegar can over-condition and make your hair seem greasy. She could try skipping the vinegar a few days and see what that does. If she feels like her hair is too dry without it, she can try it just on the ends, not let it get near the scalp.   Baking soda is good at degreasing (I use it on my range hood!)  and it's possible she is over-stripping her hair with the baking soda and her scalp is over-reacting to replenish the natural oils. She could try less baking soda or none, and see what happens. You can wash your hair with just water.   The scalp seems to adjust it's oil production to replace what you wash away, so the less you strip it, the less oil it produces--eventually. ||||| Make your own castile soap and dilute it.  You can use it for everything.  If you don't want to make your own just buy Dr. Bronners. ||||| As others have said, the transition period can vary from one person to the next, and for some, it can last a couple of months. It took about 6 weeks for me to notice results of the baking soda and ACV treatment, and it wasn't the easiest time; mine was oily and pretty unattractive in transition. But I'd go through it again in a heartbeat, because the difference is pretty amazing!  Dry shampoo or cornstarch rubbed into the scalp can help with the appearance and feel of greasy scalp. Also, I found that combing my hair thoroughly before washing it made a big difference. Good luck! ||||| I have not shampooed my hair since I shaved my head a year or so ago (it's about half a foot long now). I wash it with water only. I didn't get a "greasy" transition period, since my hair was so short at first, but now I routinely get compliments on how great my hair looks, and sometimes people ask what I do to it to get it to look so nice.   The answer? Nothing. I shower every day or so with hot water, and sometimes cold water too. That's it. You don't need products to keep your hair nice, whether they're vinegar or baking soda or shampoo. Your hair was designed to stay healthy and happy through the natural sebum (oil) in it, and shampoo strips it of that oil. I don't know what baking soda or vinegar do, but they seem unnecessary to me. You will have to deal with the greasy transition period where your head gets used to not having to overproduce oil, but eventually it will mellow out and your hair will just look nice with no work whatsoever on your part. ||||| Would have been ideal if you'd included her washing schedule and general ratios. For what it's worth, I've been doing this for two years now, and saw ridiculously good results. Not only did it completely get my maddening curly/wavy/straight melange under control, but I only wash my hair at most once a week these days.  I had no idea what I was doing at first, and it took about a month for it to even slightly start working for me. These days, I use about 1 tbsp of bicarb for the wash, and a splash (1/2 tbsp?) of vinegar into an 8 oz cup that I then fill with shower water for the "conditioning".  How long is her hair? Is it just the scalp that gets greasy, or is it throughout the entire length? Is she diluting the vinegar? I've read posts where people were just pouring straight vinegar on their heads. >.<   I've tried a few of the shampoo soap things, and they made my hair super "greasy" and residue-y. If she does switch to that, I hope she sees better results. ||||| This two step process works best. Wash, then a rinse.  For the wash... 1/3 - 2/3 cups of pure baking soda with 10 - 20 drops of lavender oil (helps balance PH levels- 'grease', and smells great), 10 - 20 drops rosemary oil (conditioner), could also add 5 or so drops of tea tree oil (actually an anti fungal), this is for 1 GALLON of the "wash". Mix all together in a gallon jug. Pour over hair slowly. No real need to massage into hair/scalp, but won't hurt. Leave in hair for 5 or 10 minutes (wash everything else while you're waiting).  For the rinse... Apple cider vinegar is best, and only as a very diluted rinse. I'm talking like 2 table spoons max in 1 gallon of water. Mix well, pour over head slowly to rinse hair. (Use a little more shower water if you feel it's not completely rinsed -cold)  Oh and when you use the apple cider rinse, use the coldest water you can handle. This will cause your pores to "close" up, witch will help with the scalp drying out, and in turn prevents the scalp from becoming over-oily to compensate. Too many products, and too much washing, and hot water, are usually the cause of greasy hair, because they dry out your scalp.  Believe it or not this mix will help balance the PH levels of your scalp. This should eliminate greasiness. But overtime. You only need to wash your hair every 2 to 3 days or so with this, and after a week or few you should see great success! You'll be able to wash less and have clean hair.  (Sorry for the sloppiness, I'm on my mobile device and multi-tasking. Ha) ||||| [URL]  Tell her not to wash her hair so often, in fact, for the next week she needs to use only water, then maybe add back in baking soda  Tell her she must MUST must brush her hair with a boar bristle brush everyday, like 100 strokes... Maybe twice a day,   Tell her she cant use any styling product on her hair at all... At all at all... There are some natural ones that work with out destroying your hair, but she cant use them now.   Tell her that she can use egg yolks and honey... Probably two if shes got long hair, mix it with a bit of olive oil, like a tablespoon or two and tablespoon of honey and a cup of water or so, just so its not too thick, comb it into wet hair, let it set for five or ten minutes or so... Rinse it out and towel dry it real good... (Only do thid once or twice a month, adds TOO much conditioning if more)   Heres a couple of informative links i like...   [URL]  [URL]  [URL] ||||| Are you making sure to bathe on a schedule? she's not bathing extra to counter the lack of soap is she?  Bathing inconsistently messes with yours skin too.  ||||| As other people have said it depends on your ratios, I use 1 cup of water to 1 tablespoon baking soda / apple cider vinegar and I think it's fantastic compared to normal commercial shampoos (at least all the shampoos I have used over the years). (Male with past-shoulder length hair) ||||| This method didn't work for me until I cut my hair shorter. Now I swear by it. Messing with the ratios should definitely be done before she gives up all together. I second the apple cider vinegar and when we travel I use JR Liggetts shampoo bars and Dr. Bronner's leave in conditioner:) ||||| give it at least a month. i stopped using shampoo at 15 and haven't used it since. it took about a month. still, i never did the baking soda/vinegar thing.  ||||| I'm just curious; how does this make life simpler?  I'm all for it if it's something you want to do, I just don't understand the reasoning.  There seems to be more effort involved, and you still have two bottles of something in your shower - it seems less than simplified.  EDIT:  Just saw your comment about bad chemicals in shampoo.  Which chemicals are bad and why? ||||| Keep it up! I had a long (2 months almost) transition time, but my hair is SUPER healthy now, and I only have to wash it (with the baking soda shampoo and vinegar conditioner) one or twice a week. Give it at least a couple months until you switch back.   Having said that... it might just not work for you, but I would suggest looking up [recipes]([URL] for homemade shampoo/conditioner. By making it yourself in bulk you can still save money.  ||||| [r/nopoo]([URL] ||||| Check out [crunchybetty.com]([URL] for tip, tricks and a whole community's take on the no 'poo experiment.    I did it for about 6 months and I feel like it improved my hair's texture and saved the earth a little bit.  I went back to shampoo because I experimented with essential oils in my conditioner and the baking soda wasn't washing it clean.  I think I would try it again though if I think my hair needs it.  Now I use an organic, sulfate free shampoo.  ||||| I use baking soda and lemon juice. I think it's about the juice of two lemons with some baking soda added. You don't want it to be a paste. You want a little runny so it will go through your hair. Start at the scalp, comb it through, then put a bag or shower cap on your head for 30 minutes. It will clean up all the excess oil. Then rinse it out. I'll then add a little castor oil to my ends. (I have curly hair.) I don't use this method more than once a week. Most of the time I just rinse my hair with water and go.  ||||| That sounds... horrible.  ||||| I did that for awhile. If it's greasy you should use more baking soda, but my hair ended up getting really dry. Now I use shampoo bars. The ingredients are mainly oils, but they somehow do a great job of cleaning my hair, but yet I also don't have to wash my hair to often (usually every 3 days or so). Plus they're pretty cheap (about 5 bucks and I only use one per month)! I still use vinegar as a conditioner. ||||| dissolve 1/2 tsp baking soda into ~16 oz. water (short, not too greasy)  you're looking for a very low lather when you gently rub it in your scalp.   ||||| On a daily basis, I use a conditioner.  Once a week I use normal shampoo.  Every other time I shampoo, I follow that with a mixture of 1 part vinegar : 2 parts water.  I am very happy. ||||| I agree that it's probably a ratio problem. Everyone has naturally different hair, so how much moisture to de-greaser you use depends on your skin. Also, don't try to wash your hair everyday. If you are just rinsing it's ok, but it will be hard to find  good balance if you are constantly stripping your hair of its natural oils.  I use rosemary, lavender, tea tree, and eucalyptus essential oils in my conditioner with my ACV for anticeptic and odor purposes.  ||||| I've been using baking soda and vinegar for about.. 2 years this February, I think. I went on a short hiatus this summer (I was working at a camp where I was in and out of a lake all day, and it REALLY screwed with my hair...)   I have longish (Past shoulders), super dry (I've always been lectured by stylists about how I must color and heat-treat too much... even though I have never done the former and rarely do the latter), slightly curly hair. Thought I'd provide that for some perspective.  I have found that what works best for me is to use baking soda every few days, as the 'shampoo'. I really use it just as often as I was using regular shampoo-- whenever my hair felt gunky, but no more than that.   Nearly every day that I shower, I condition with the vinegar mixture. I use a 50/50 vinegar/water mixture (I've used both apple cider and white, and never found it to be a difference for me, other than smell) thoroughly distributed.   As of now, my hair is the healthiest it has ever been =]  The only times I have had issues have been in the fall, when my skin is adjusting from summer to winter (I live in MI, so there is a bit of a difference... and when it gets cold, I tend to take stupidly hot showers)  If she is having grease issues, I would recommend doing as others have mentioned- if she is using the baking soda every day, DON'T. It can strip your hair hella fast, and makes your skin produce more oils. Just use the baking soda... as needed!
1489	1,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3	29	I was just recently reminded of this story by another hitchhiking story on here. My dad used to tell me and my brother all sorts of stories from his youth hitchhiking down the east coast. There are two that have always really stuck with me and I figured if you guys like this one I'll post the other one.  When my dad was 15 he left home in Massachusetts and hitchhiked down to Florida where his older sister was living in Daytona. This event apparently happened on this trip somewhere in Virginia. He had been trying to hitch a ride outside of some city though he could never remember which one (this happened in 1976 and there were a lot of drugs done between then and now) and this really nice car stopped and picked him up.    He and the driver  get to talking and the guy tells my dad that he is a surgeon at one of the local hospitals, gives him a business card and tells him if he ever needs anything at that hospital to give them his name. All is going well and he is apparently heading pretty far south for some family function so its a long way that my dad doesn't have to walk. He seems like a nice professional guy, clean cut and well spoken. Then shit starts to get weird (my dad's exact wording at this part of the story every time he tells it).  The doctor starts giving my dad the side-eye and seems like he wants to say something but can't quite figure out how to say it. Of course my dad is just sort of ignoring him because as he says "I had been on the road for a while and hadn't had a shower or change in clothes in weeks". Then the guy finally comes out and says it.  "Can I suck your dick?"  My dad was obviously taken aback by this and tells him no.  "Please, just let me suck it a little."  "No"  "I'll give you fifty bucks if you let me suck your dick"  "No!"  "How about you just let me see it. Can I see it?"  "No. I think you had better let me off here."  And surprisingly the guy does. He pulls off at a rest stop and lets my dad out. Before he pulls away though he hands my dad that fifty bucks and tells him, "Sorry about that man, I hope I didn't blow your mind or anything".  This isn't super creepy but I thought you guys might like it. My dad always said the guy didn't seem like a bad guy, just really messed up and honestly sorry to have freaked him out so bad. I have no way of knowing if it is totally true except that my aunt says my dad told her the same story when he got to Florida a few weeks later. ||||| What a nice guy. He gave your dad a ride and $50! ||||| The part that stuck out to me was"hope I didnt blow your mind." lol ||||| The part of this that really stuck out to me is when he said, "not even a little?" How do you suck a dick "a little." ?  ||||| Holy Jesus...I thought we were related for a minute. We live in Massachusetts, and my dad used to hitch hike down to Florida all the time when he was young and he's told me some weird stories ||||| So a lonely guy picked up your dad, he refused sexual contact and the guy left him out of the car without a struggle? The guy actually seems like a really nice guy and I'd be fine with meeting him. Not sexually, but he sounds nice enough. ||||| lol born in massachusetts, raised in florida, and currently living in virginia!   i'm glad hitch hiking isn't as big a thing as it used to be.  ||||| >"Please, just let me suck it a little."  Lol  ||||| This reminds me of an issue in Hellblazer, I believe it was the special 1. It starts with a young Constantine who is hitchhiking. A priest picked him, and during the trip he started to show erratic behavior. He ended up trying to suck his penis. I believe he actually asked him first if he could suck it. Weird shit.

3490	1,3,3,3,3	9	Hello guys.  I'm new to Alibaba, buying from china and business in general. I've been looking around for suppliers for a couple of weeks now and after reviewing all possible suppliers I think I have decided on one.  Obviously I am aware of the scams and such that occur on alibaba. The potential supplier i have chosen, as described in the thread title, is a 7 year gold supplier with trade assurance and onsite check.  My question is - Can i be sure this isn't a scam supplier. Is there anything extra I should do to double check apart from the usual things such as looking up on google maps, checking internet scam lists etc.  Many thanks in advance.  ||||| you can never be 100% sure it's a scam supplier. Also, please note, not every single one on there is some scam supplier. Actually there are not as many as people make it out to be. Actually I'm not even sure how this notion that there are millions of scam suppliers on ali even came about. I've dealt with over 10 suppliers in the past 8 months and none of them have been scammers. I've paid through bank wire transfer and paypal, on first orders with bank wire transfer.  Talk with the supplier, talk with many suppliers actually and get a feel for them as you talk with them about your product. Once you feel safe to move forward, you can proceed. You can negotiate T/T terms as well.  Be sure to talk to more than one supplier at a time and don't be afraid to say no. ||||| When dealing with foreign companies it is very critical to perform due diligence. That is , it is important to research your potential suppliers or alternatively you can use quality control and inspection companies such us our self. We have various company verification services ranging from a [company background check]([URL] to supplier visits & a more intensive Factory Audit.  ||||| I've used Alibaba many times - I have yet to be scammed.  But I spend quite a bit of time on due diligence and avoid suppliers that do not have a multi-year rating.  There's a kind of dance that you have to do with a supplier - asking questions, vetting the information that they provide, cross-checking the data on Alibaba with additional other info (websites).  If this is intended to be a long-term source, before sending a large order, start by buying a series of small (but increasingly larger) sample orders.  It's a bit like dating...  You have to do a careful dance to grow trust while not acting like you don't trust them...

8963	1,3,3,2,3	11	I am interested in trying Twilight Imperium, along with a friend of mine. my girlfriend is not so interested because of how long the gameplay can and might take. but she did tell me that her watching a video of people playing the game, with a short intro stating what the game is, then while playing the game having the rules explained when those rules come up in the gameplay like they do in tabletop is a way to potentially peek her interest in trying the game out. so my question is if there are any partial or full game play videos that do something like this or if it is just something no one has done because of the complexity and length of play of the game.  anyways thanks for helping. ||||| Best I can suggest is SU&SD's [Let's Play]([URL] video, but it's very light on rules explanation.  ||||| My best advise to to build off of what she's into (a particular mechanic, a sci-fi theme, the House of Cards style politics, whatever it is that you think will make her like the game) and use that as the engine that will drive her desire to learn the rules and play the game.   The best guide I've seen (non video) is here: [URL] not because it's comprehensive, it's not, but because it's well written and has a sense of humor.

I try breaking up but he keeps coming back promising to be better. Well...I cheated on him with his best friend a week ago. And I have no one now. I thought I was alone before but now it's like I can't function. I can't talk right. I can't do my job right. It's hard to look at him.

Great for my self esteem. :) but yeah...I just feel different. ||||| Sounds like you were stuck in a bad relationship for way too long. No relationship is perfect, but one thing I've learned is that if you're unhappy the first go-around, things are probably not going to be much better if you get back together after a breakup. Nobody can really change their personality like that. Cheating was probably a symptom of an unhealthy relationship. You were unhappy and that's how you expressed it. Morally it's not the best thing, but you don't deserve to be treated like the scum of the earth for it. It sounds like there was potentially some emotional abuse in your relationship, so it's not unusual for you to feel like this (since you were probably made emotionally dependent on him). I noticed that you said "it's hard to look at him." Do you live with your boyfriend? Being around him is not the best thing right now.  Why do you not have any friends? If you're old enough to go out on your own, go do something that interests you. You're sure to find like-minded individuals. Note that not every social interaction is going to go perfect the first time, or many times afterwards, and it's not necessarily your fault.

97	1,3,2	6	My boyfriend and I work for the same company (yes I know this can cause trouble but he was worth this risk!) and he recently got moved to a different department. I've worked for the company about a year longer than him and have basically seen no reward for my hard work, and I get more work done and a higher level work done than anyone in my department.   He got transferred to a new department where he will be getting paid more than me and also get to travel on the company dime. All the while I'm stuck in the same department where I get no recognition for any of the work I do and work for a conniving boss who takes credit for my work. So, obviously, I'm a bit jealous of his move to a new department.  On top of all of this, my university is playing in a sweet sixteen game in the NCAA tournament and I would kill to go to it. I'm a huge basketball fan and this is huge for them. Since he is now in this new section of the company he got offered by the CEO a ticket to the game. Now obviously I am outrageously jealous and pissed off about the unfairness of the situation. My boyfriend didn't even go to the university. We were originally planning on trying to go with each other but he didn't want to spend the money. Now that he is getting to go for free he wants to go and doesn't get why I'm upset.   So really I'm just looking for some advice on how to overcome this jealousy I'm feeling and not resent him for these extra bonuses he is getting from our company. As much as I want to be happy for him it is incredibly difficult when the situation is so unfair.  I love him so so so so so much. More than anyone I've ever dated. We are perfect for each other in almost every way. And I don't want this to ruin our relationship. SO HALP.  TLDR.. my boyfriend recently got a new position at our company and is getting all sorts of special treatment by the company because of it. How do I overcome my jealous feelings? ||||| I'll start with a specific. He probably sees going to the game with the CEO as a golden networking opportunity. Honestly, I'd think that's a good sign for you. He may be thinking about you two in the long term, making sure you both have the best possible financial situation. Not that that totally justifies his decision, but it's probably what he's thinking about.  On your end, let me talk as one sports fan to another. I'm a huge 49ers fan. A few years ago when they went to the Super Bowl, I was on cloud 9. There was no way I would be able to go to the game no matter how much I wanted to. Instead of despairing, I reminded myself that as huge as this game is, there will be other football games, Super Bowl or not. So, it shouldn't matter *where* I am when the game is happening. I'll be just as excited as would be with 50 yard line seats, front row.  As for your job, take a good look at why you do your job. You have to do it because you love the job whether you make yourself love it or naturally love it. If neither of those are an option, then that's not a job you need to have. Your jealous thoughts source from some sort of fear. Get down to the root of that and deal with it directly. ||||| Would you feel the same if it was the exact same situation but he worked somewhere else?

I was under five years old.  ||||| I didn't tell my parents that I lost a tooth and I put it under my pillow. No cash. I saw wal-greens tags on my presents for Santa.

7797	1,3,3,3,3	10	When I was younger, mainly through junior high and high school I was always an extremely horny young man, and my mind would constantly wander to inappropriate subjects for my location, leading me to become very obviously.... "excited". I'd always try poking myself with a pencil or pinching myself but it never made a difference, my erection would persist..  eventually the bell would ring to dismiss class, which would force me to stuff my hand down my pants and hastily rearrange my dick before I stood up and walked around with a tent in the halls. (amazingly i never got caught.. or at least nobody let on that they could see me grabbing myself)  I could never move around comfortably with it tucked to the side, so I always had to tuck it up and through the top of my boxers, often poking out of the top of my pants. And years later I've noticed that my penis most definitely points up. Like this "/" as opposed to a straight out "-" from my body. I'm curious if anyone else tucked their dick to the side for years and had results where their penis eventually started pointing that way naturally? Or is it just a natural curve my wang? ||||| Its the chicken and the egg all over you may have started tucking in the direction of your penis naturally points. Which came first will be hard to say ||||| I never had that problem, mine curves slightly down. *Shrugs.  I always thought wang curve was genetic and random. I think scientist would have a hard time getting a grant to study this. ||||| When really hard. I always point skyward.  ||||| My boyfriend always tucks his to the left side and it leans slightly to the left as a result.

These posts remind me that I can be both minimalist and girly at the same time.

8473	1,3,3,3	4	I'm running a Crucial SSD with a Gigabyte z68ap-d3 (F5), and have been trying to install Windows 8 straight to the SSD. I formatted the SSD on the previous Windows 7 install, which was on a separate HDD that I have retired (and is no longer connected), so it should be good to go.  My bios is very basic and as far as I can tell doesn't have any SSD specific options (i'm sure they're there, though), and it doesn't show up as recognizing the SSD.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I have spent the whole day building this PC and i'd love nothing more than to watch a film on it tonight, thanks :)   EDIT:  I'm an idiot, the power cable wasn't plugged in, I guess I need a break (Have been working on this since I woke up and it's midnight now. Thanks for the responses though, I appreciate it. ||||| two things:    unplug all the other hard drives.  I've had this happen before where it sees it in the list but it isn't #1 so it doesn't work for some reason.  Does the bios have a auto-detect?  Does the drive show up in bios? ||||| To me it sounds like the BIOS does not see the SSD.   I would try to update the BIOS, but for that you will have to use your Windows 7 install (HDD).  ||||| I'm glad you solved this one but I've run into that problem with Windows 7 in the past and ended up getting around it by installing to a small HDD and then cloning it to the SSD.  It wasn't pretty but it worked.
6799	1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3	32	I'm considering getting a dog, preferably a puppy. I'm looking at getting a black lab, or a german shepard, or a husky, or something similar. Any idea where to start looking for one? Animal shelters, pounds, etc. Anything helps!  ||||| Ottawa Humane Society  [URL]  [URL] ||||| [URL] ||||| There are a ton of Ottawa-based dog rescues! Here are some I can think of:  * [Hopeful Hearts]([URL] * [Ottawa Dog Rescue]([URL] * [BARK]([URL] - a friend of mine fosters dogs from here. He's had a good experience with them. Worth a look! * [Genesis Dog Rescue]([URL] * [Blue Moon Rescue]([URL] * [I am Alive Rescue]([URL]  Petfinder is also pretty good and you may find some smaller rescues through it that don't have websites. There are some, I think one in Almonte or Carleton Place area for example, that don't have a website and just have a Facebook page.  Good luck! :) ||||| Can I make a suggestion before you get a puppy? Foster.  I've been wanting a dog of my own for a long time, but knew it wasn't right of me to do so because of other commitments. I foster puppies, which is a lot of fun and rewarding and tough and you get so many feels and you know that you are helping save an animal and omg all the feels.  Puppies don't stay puppies forever, unless you foster. :) It's really helpful especially if you aren't sure what sort of dog to get (seems you are on the fence) and to make sure your life is pet friendly or adaptable to pets.  I've also found that pet sitting is a good way to get your daily dose of dog. I'm a huge sucker for my four legged pals to come around and chill on the couch with me while their people are off doing things.  (Also, there's a group in Ottawa called Sit With Me. They're good folk!) ||||| Puppies are a lot of work. An older rescue dog is easier sometimes.   Some rescue organizations need foster homes. If you are not sure how a dog will work for you it's like a test drive.  ||||| Friendly Giants is having an adoption day this Sunday at the Glebe Pet Valu!   And if you need a dog trainer, especially if you get a puppy, send me a PM, I know a few good ones! ||||| The algonquin vet program adopts dogs out from the Aylmer SPCA. We got our pooch there and couldn't be happier. Cost was I think 250$ and she came spayed and with all her shots. ||||| In addition to /u/DailyPower 's and /u/Tortfeasor55 's links, also check out [Keshet Kennels]([URL]  They have some beautiful dogs of the breeds you specified there right now.  I know they'll show up on pet-finder as well, but I was looking at Keshet Kennels recently and saw all those gorgeous lab, shepherd, and husky mixes.    Also, feel free to walk in to [The SPCA of Western Quebec]([URL] to meet some dogs in person.  They are often over-crowded with dogs to be adopted, so you would have the opportunity to meet so many.  The [SPCA De L'Outaouais]([URL] is particularly over-croweded AND they don't list their pets on petfinder (that I've seen), so it's a particularly good idea to go there to meet some dogs.  I had the good fortune of meeting [this guy]([URL] when doing a transport for Arbed Rescue.  I fell in love within 5 minutes of walking him after he got out of the truck he'd been in for 5 hours that came from a pound in Quebec.  He walks SO WELL on leash and all he LOVES to be pet.  The minute you touch him, he gets surprised and starts begging for more.  Freddy is listed as a terrier mix, but I thought there was some lab in there.  Arbed Rescue also has a lab, [Teddy]([URL] and a GSD, [Boomer]([URL]  I haven't met either of them.  Good luck with your search.  I hope you find the perfect dog for you.  edit: why would you downvote this??? ||||| Not to come down on ya or anything but you have considered with bigger dog's you have to take them out for frequent walks and whatnot right? especially with huskies they have a LOT of energy and will tear stuff up with no outlet for it, not trying to dissuade you or anything, just a friendly reminder :) .  ||||| Go through a rescue if you can. Also like previously mentioned with rescues you can go into a foster to adopt and make sure the dog meshes with you. You will also get support from the rescue. I am currently a foster home for poets vision aussie rescue and we just got in this cute little puppy. You should check out the site. If you have any questions feel free to PM me :) ||||| Have you ever owned a dog before? Rescues sometimes have behavioural problems and are not recommended for first time dog owners. You've also named a few rather different breeds. Do your research into them before looking for a breeder/shelter. German Shepherds, for example, need tons of exercise and a back yard.  ||||| Just do your research into breeders, it took us 4 before we found one we like and bought our black lab. If you want I can forward some info on lab breeders. I'd suggest ones that offer hip and eye guarantees. Just remember getting a dog isn't cheap and takes time but can be very rewarding. I suggest Kirkland brand dog food, it is very highly rated. Basically don't rush into anything, know that dogs need walks twice a day at least 40 mins and obedience. Once you do this you will have your best friend for a long time. Also highly suggest crate training. The main thing with that is know the create is their safe place and they should never be placed in there as punishment.
8192	1,3,3,2,2,2,3,3	20	I have noticed in several ground 'after' pictures of the Jarrell TX May 27 - 1997 there are these odd round circles on the ground. I am familiar with cycloidal arcing, drag marks, etc. but don't recall seeing these before in tornado damage images until Jarrell.   [URL]  Is it possible, since Jarrell was a multi-vortex, that these are touchdown 'suction' marks from small vortices within the larger body? They seem very tightly clustered. I just can't figure out what else they could be. ||||| One thing that always gets left out of the conversation when talking about the Jarrell tornado is how SLOWLY it moved. [Most people haven't seen this video]([URL]  And [check the RADAR loop while you're at it]([URL]   The tornado as seen on this video does not look particularly intimidating does it?  Notice in particular the fact that all the traffic here on I-35 is stopped to allow it to pass.  This really only happens when there is time enough to do that.  Most of the time, it's a free for all.  The tornado changed characteristics as it approached the subdivision where all the deaths occured, but the speed did not change much at all.  Okay, and if you watched the RADAR loop I can tell you that, yes, the storm movement towards the southwest is CORRECT.  This cell backbuilt against the direction of the ambient wind, which created a monstrous potential helicity.  The Jarrell tornado is unofficially classified by a lot of mets as a grinder.  It may not have had the fastest wind speeds, but because of the time duration of the winds on the ground in this particular subdivision, the damage multiplier was nearly unimaginable.  The Jarrell tornado suction and grinding was so immense, that it pulled up some of the asphalt roads in this area.  The [Official Damage Survey]([URL] doesn't actually list evidence of multiple vortices!  [BONUS:  Here is the location of that picture today]([URL]  EDIT:  Also able to find another picture [directly after the tornado]([URL] where you can see the foundations and some debris still there.  The later picture you have may have other outside reasons for scouring - possibly debris removal. ||||| I'm spit-balling here, but seems to me that those are way too close and regularly spaced to be touchdown points for sub-vortices.  I also don't really have a guess for what it could be, but just my $.02. ||||| these potmarks could very well be caused by the tornado.  Is there any orientation, NSEW, for this photo?  If you think of how wind blows across a fluid; it makes ripples.  The puddles could be the troughs and the mud be the peaks.  ||||| Could they be marks from large pieces of debris impacting the ground? This looks like it was taken at Double Creek Estates, and well everything in that division was flying around. ||||| throwing one idea out there - could it be an irrigation system?   I don't know how far apart sprinkler heads normally are, but if that spacing is similar, it could be water left over from the heads getting ripped off the ground was scoured. ||||| It does look odd, but I'd say it's just coincidental. It's a result of the intense scouring that occurred throughout Double Creek, resulting in a surface that was very lumpy and uneven. When the heavy rains came through afterward, it created a bunch of patchy, vaguely roundish puddles. Here are a few ground views of it:  [URL]  [URL]  [URL]  And you can sorta see it after it's begun to dry up in the background of these photos:  [URL]  [URL] ||||| My gut tells me that these are unrelated to the tornado.  I could give you a couple theories but they're all hog wash. (For example let's just say that yard had a row of bradford pear trees that were freshly planted and the tornado ripped them out. You're seeing the holes created to gather water around the roots)  Either way, I'll be excited if you're curiosity proves my gut wrong!

678	1,3,3,3,3,3	6	I am seven months along in my pregnancy, about 5 feet 10 inches tall, and about 215 pounds. I miss-stepped off of a shallow curb in the dark walking to my car this evening and fell onto my side in a couple of inches of snow. I feel completely fine and I didn't fall directly onto my stomach but I also don't really know what the protocol is for small tumbles while you're pregnant. Should I worry about the fall and if it hurt the baby? ||||| I would call the doctor, just to be sure. If you didn't directly hit your abdomen and don't have any contractions/decreased fetal movement/vaginal leaking or bleeding, you're in better shape than you could be. ||||| Call your doctor/midwife. I fell on my belly when I was exactly 38 weeks. I called the doctor and it took an hour for the on call doctor to call me back. I was told that I could go in for 4 hours of monitoring but I was likely to be fine since everything felt normal by the time I talked to a doctor.   I had my baby two days later. It was probably a coincidence but part of me wonders if falling sped things up.  ||||| I fell in the snow when the east coast had the blizzard. I fell gracefully and mostly on my back. I felt tense in my back but baby kept kicking and moving just fine so I never called. But if you are nervous I would call just to be safe.  ||||| My stupid doberman pulled me over around 36 weeks maybe. I busted up my knees and elbow. I called my doctor and they said as long as baby is moving that it was probably okay, and offered me the same thing as someone else already mentioned.

5649	1,3,3,3,3	10	At a conference.  For breakfast, delicious looking pastries abounded.  I ate 2 hard boiled eggs and had coffee+half n half (no cream to be found).  At lunch, there were: veggie+cheese sandwiches with impossibly thick bread, beef sandwiches with impossibly thick bread, and wraps.  I took one of each and did not eat any breads.  There was no silverware, so I used toothpicks, too shy to ask. There were lemon bars.  I came back to the main conference and there are tables covered in candy and chocolate chip + oatmeal raisin cookies.  Total lunch food: 2-3 oz roast beef, 2 pieces of cheese, some grilled/oiled zucchini and yellow squash, 2 oz chicken, one bite of chocolate ThinkThin Bar (I couldn't handle the sweet cravings after staring at those cookies) and a mint.

7971	1,3,3	10	I'm hoping someone here on reddit can help a novice engine mechanic get this old girl started. I think it's a 1975 but not certain. Been sitting quite a bit. New plugs, new fuel filter(facing the right direction. I put little gas in the plugs and and fired up for a second. Spray plugswith carb cleaner? too much water get in the tank while sitting? I did drain all the old gas and put in fresh. Any ideas where to look next would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! ||||| First, check compression!!! Make sure you have good flow out the exhaust. Clogged exhaust can fucker things up. If both of those are good. Disassemble carb. Boil in water with some simply green. (Be sure to remove any rubber that could melt). After boiling 10-20 ish minutes. go through and spray with air. Take a flashlight and trace the air passages. You should see light shine through a hole on some other side. If you find any blockages, keep cleaning. Even the smallest specs of crud can make or break ignition with a carburated fuel system. Im a small engine mechanic student. I know what im talking about. And im currently restoring a 76 pantera. So im a bit familiar with these cats.  ||||| First step would be taking off that POS Tilliltonson carb and running a more modern day carb, assuming that it has a tilly. These carbs may have been good for their day but their time has come.   If you havent touched the carb at all it needs to come off to be cleaned , more than likely that is your problem.  Another thing to try if you have fresh gas is blowing with your mouth onto the gas tank. It pushes the fresh gas into the carb(assuming you cleaned out the old gunk and gas first.

Here's to a safe and easy delivery, and a happy and healthy mother and baby! ||||| Induction can be very painful, so heres my best advice   *No complaining about yourself   *If she asks not to be touched- DON'T TOUCH HER. its not personal shes just in a lot of pain.  *Try not to leave the room.  *Bring plenty of cloths, pack your tooth brush, her tooth brush, face wipes, protein bars, her favorite fizzy drink (she will have low blood sugar after giving birth, keep it as a surprise she will thank you for it)   *if its back labor she will appriciate a lower back rub if she wants to be touched.  *A cold flannel on the face can feel amazing while in labor  *Make sure she eats a large protein dinner and gets a lot of rest, also if you want her to go into labor naturally I have heard eating a whole pineapple works a treat                         ||||| Honestly, my induction experience was not bad at all. They started Pitocin at 6am and he was out by 2:16pm. The pain was pretty bad, but once I got a "walking epidural" it was manageable. I could still feel the slight pressure but not the pain. I pushed for 45 minutes (only because I'm very, very petite and he got stuck in there for a moment. They had to use forceps on me). I would do it again.      Just be there for her. I love how attentive my husband was. He just sat right with me, like a PP said. I brought some clothes, laptop (even though I never used it), cellphone, chargers, and other basics.

7303	1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3	15	(This is a repost of the same thread I made on the forums)  Hello everyone, I make silly videos on the internet that some people may or may not have seen.  A few months ago I started a new series called Cities of Norrath where I break down the starting cities of classic EQ. The first episode can be found here: [URL] probably easier to watch than for me to explain the videos structure in this post.  However the reason for this post is not to plug my videos. As I mention in the link above, Qeynos was really the only city I knew well enough to show all the cool easter eggs and other interesting bits of information that the city has.  Moving forward with the series I am looking for help from the community to cover easter eggs and the like for the other cities. I have already posted the Freeport episode which ended up taking a more lore approach rather than easter eggs. I am currently working on Rivervale and either Halas or Neriak will come after that depending on the viewers vote in the last videos comments.   So please if anyone has any little tidbit or easter egg about any of these cities please let me know, I will be giving shoutouts in the videos to anyone who contributes, provided the information isn't just completely made up of course.  An example of the information I am looking for is like in Rivervale if you go to any of the guards and say "Nice Hat" they will respond with "Thank you, It is worn with pride and is the symbol of the Rivervale Militia." ||||| Other than its remoteness, Qeynos is perhaps the most friendly city for new players. The Gnoll Fang and Rabid Wolf/Bear Pelt quests reward experience and gold at a rate far surpassing any quests that other cities offer. Starting a new character in Qeynos generally means you'll level faster than characters that start in other cities, and you'll end up with more money in your pocket. The downside is once you hit your mid teens, there isn't much left for you and you'll have to make the harrowing trip to the east to progress in zones like Oasis, Guk, or Unrest.  Erud's Crossing is one of the first "risk vs. reward" zones in the game. Willowisps are difficult, can only be hit by magic, and tend to assist each other and swarm the player if they're not careful, but the lightstones and greater lightstones they drop can be turned in at North Karana for excellent experience and gold. The bandit camps of West Karana are similar as they drop sashes that you can turn in to the Karana guild for great exp and cash (bronze weapons!) but the bandits often come in multiples and some are druids and wizards which are much stronger than normal warrior NPCs. Druids especially can take advantage of the bandit camps since they have access to the Harmony spell.  Finally, the Qeynos Aqueducts are really an undiscovered gem for many players and it's definitely worth learning the layout if you like playing in the Qeynos area. You can take full advantage of the zone as any player class or alignment, as long as you know where the Bloodsaber guild is so you can stay clear of it.  The Qeynos Aqueducts essentially has the lowest level rare mobs that drop loot in the game. The "an undead knight" drops a +5 HP ring, and "an injured rat" drops a +5 HP earring. At level 2-3 you can kill mobs around both of these nearby areas and gain a significant +20 HP boost from the gear that drops. A little further in "a nesting rat" drops a 2 AC 3 CHA necklace, and in the back is Qubert, a tiny rare gelatinous cube that drops a dress that you turn in just outside the Aqueducts for experience and a reward. The reward is sometimes a +3 INT earring, which is an amazing boost considering the area is decent experience for Necromancers/Magicians/Enchanters once they obtain their level 4 pet spell anyways.  One Qeynos easter egg that I can think of that you missed are "Guard Regis" and "Guard Philbin" in Qeynos Hills.  Rivervale is one of the cities that I don't have a lot of experience with since I never played many Halfling characters. Maybe a reference to Sirran the Lunatic and how you have to say "llaw eht htiw eno I ma" to him to progress past island 7, and requires the player to have knowledge of an obscure Rivervale quest. I always thought that was an interesting part of the game.  I can't think of many points of interest in Halas. There's a Brin McQuaid in McQuaid's Bar and Stout which is an obvious reference to Brad McQuaid. Also I always found it interesting that vanilla EQ only had 3 dagger graphics, and the most unique and interesting one is exclusively only used by the daggers wielded by the rogues in Halas.  Also, Mithaniel Marr created the Barbarians in his likeness, yet Barbarians can't worship their own creator. Apparently in early versions of the game Barbarians could be Paladins of Mithaniel Marr, but that was removed for some reason. It's a bit of a plot hole in the game.  Edit: Apparently I was a bit off on this. While the Marrs are "Barbarians" (not actual Barbarians since they're gods, but they're physically similar to the Barbarians), the story is a bit more complex:  >Barbarians, also known as Northmen, were created when the god of dreams, Morell Thule, impregnated Erollisi using one half of her brother Mithaniel's divine Gift of Life (the other half of which was used to create the Frogloks). The Queen of Love was tended to by the elves she was staying with at the time, and eventually gave birth to the first of a new mortal race. These were the first Barbarians.  Sooo you could essentially say that the Barbarians were created out of incest between Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr, although not real incest, more like magical incest? Considering that Humans, Erudites, and Half-Elves (sorta) are direct descendants of the Barbarians, this is a fairly important, if not weird, part of the lore. ||||| Good stuff! Qeynos is a vastly underrated place to be and, in my opinion, is by far the best starting area. Cash, basic loot and xp through mobs and quests are available in abundance. Options for lvl15+ are also all around: move to highpass, the Karana's, the Warrens or Everfrost and eventually Permafrost are all legit options.   The only issue is that people often move to the vicinity of EC 'for buffs' so unless you got a few regular friends that play with you, it might be hard to maintain the awesome xp/cash curve past 15.  I followed you on YT and Twitch! :) ||||| I love your videos sir. Godspeed to you!  I'd like to know how eqemu managed to emulate little hidden gems like that. I suspect there was more than a little proprietary code/data fuelling the development of the emulator. And if so, perhaps there can be definitive solutions to old unsolved quests like [URL] ||||| >qey2hh1  [How do you pronounce that acronym?]([URL] :P  Anyway, awesome video!

[URL]  Why the split in Youtube Channels? ||||| Qeynos is one of the few cities where you can do something like this due to the fact that it's so fucking dense with scripting and lore; I'm not sure if another city can come close. ||||| I've showed this to all of my friends, this is a really well made video, definitely would love to see more.  Wish I could share more about the easter eggs but I've obviously haven't appreciated the cities and lore as much as I should have!

1519	1,3,3,3,3,3	11	I bought a 930 quite recently. It was a nice package with a free dt 601 qi charger (round),  Bluetooth/NFC speaker md12 and a quite decent hands free kit coloud wh530.  Anyway the qi charger is quite good (it was free anyway so...) but I use it at work and I would like another one for home. Also it's round and I have to make sure it's at the right spot to charge (too high and it's not working).  There's a good bunch of interesting products, Aukey q19 caught my attention but do you have suggestions?  It would have to work well with my 930 but working with my wife Nexus 4 also would be great, also powerful enough to work through her Zenus leather case?  Really thrilled about wp and the Lumia, best phone I ever owned.   Edit: Despite an urge to buy the Nokia one, especially for the NFC, I will try the Aukey because its very cheap in France and still has nice review on Amazon. I'll keep the money perhaps for the CR201 car stand for which the NFC seems like a great addition   Edit: "searching for" obviously. Sorry about that. Almost 5am, I should be sleeping already. ||||| They are all pretty similar. The older Nokia plate ones are obviously less picky about where you lay the phone, there's 3 coils in there so anywhere you lay it on the plate pretty much will do the job, and they should be pretty cheap now... way less than the 99 for that Aukey. I'd probably recommend one of the Nokia stand chargers for your desk though. ||||| Nokia Wireless Charge Plate on my bedside table (the sleek pill shaped one), and the Nokia Wireless Charging Stand on my desk. Couldn't be happier. Cost me $70.00AUD each, so not cheap, but never had a problem with them, easy to use and never have to adjust for missing the charge spot.  Charging stand also has an NFC spot on the base of it which is a nice touch.  Bought a cheap one off eBay, but it makes electrical sounds when in use, so I ended up chucking it. ||||| [URL]  TYLT Vu Wireless Charger.  I love this charger!  It's really easy to make sure it's centered on the charging spot. ||||| I wouldn't recommend the CR201. I had the CR123 and it couldn't handle the weight of my L920(yeah..the 930 is ~20g lighter) and kept drooping. Looking at the Nokia support forums, seems they never addressed the issue.  Currently using the LG puck and cradle combo(something fit2, can't recall exactly) and that works great with the 920. Admittedly, have yet to use it with my 930, but I can't imagine it not working. No NFC though(nor car adapter..). but it uses a standard micro usb so I can run my own cable, which was also a factor for me against the CR200/201. ||||| Well, Even I recently purchased a 3 coils based wireless charger with fast charging for my Lumia 930 from Amazon [URL] through which I can even charge my father’s Nexus 5. It has wide charging transmitter. 
4734	1,3,3,3,3	8	So I wanted to start tonight but [this]([URL] was all I could get.   I'm using [this]([URL] pen with this [set]([URL] to start.   For whatever reason I could only get it to flow enough to make those random marks (which were me trying to get it to flow) as of now I can't get it to flow at all.  I put the cartridge in as instructed (One cartridge goes facing the nib pushing it in until it locks in, then the other goes in the base of the pen facing away from the nib), then I tried to write. I made little side to side thin marks, as you can see, to try to get flow.   Did I miss something?   All pens are brand new, so they shouldn't need to be washed.  ||||| you may have to "encourage" the cartridge ink to make it's way fully to the nib.  Holding the barrel firmly, flick it towards a sink, or put in water and flush around.  Flushing first in this case would be a good idea as /u/LemonDaemon recommends. ||||| You should flush all pens, new or not, when you first get them. If not new, there could be leftover ink residue that dried and clogged the pen. If new, there could be stuff in there leftover from manufacture that could reduce ink flow. That's the only solution I can think of (though I'm a novice). Also, side note, since those are "calligraphy pens," and not normal fountain pens, you may have better luck on /r/calligraphy, since it is better suited for calligraphy-related questions.  ||||| I have a similar calligraphy set (although it's Sheaffer) and after fitting a cartridge it really needs persuading to get the ink flowing. Although I found that once there was ink coming out at all it was fine - it just took a while for the feed to fill. I would try flushing the feed with water as others have suggested, and also make sure that the cartridge is fully clicked into place.  ||||| I have that set, it's what I started with, too.  Sorry to say, but it has ridiculously hard starts. I used to get it running by licking my finger, putting it on the nib, and then touching it to paper towels until ink came out. Also, if using a cartridge, try squeezing the sides until ink comes out (be careful). Using the converter, just push it in.  Overall, I was happy with the set, but it's a pretty crappy pen. :(. It rusted like crazy out of nowhere for me and I haven't looked back.  If you want to do calligraphy, I recommend a pilot parallel.

6235	1,3,3,3,3	6	Hi mfa, I had a gift card for Urban Outfitters from Christmas so I bought these chinos yesterday. I was really excited because I like how they fit but now trying to wear something with them the color seems so strange. It's called "cedar" but looks almost orange to me. What can I wear with these? Should I go swap for a more subtle color? Or am I just too prude and overreacting?  [here]([URL]  And [this]([URL] is them online although they don't have my color  ||||| I think they look fine, man. But if you're not confident when wearing something then you probably shouldn't be wearing it. I'd probably wear something like that with boots instead of the shoes though.  ||||| Well, I honestly like the combination you chose in your picture, though horizontal stripes are a little tacky and the cardigan clashes a little bit with the pants. you need lighter shoes, or at least ones that aren't black which go with the chinos.  You seem to have the right idea generally. Aim for neutral colors like white, grey, or light blue, or pastel colors as a top, and something like very dark brown or white as the shoe.  ||||| Man they really loosened up the dress code at Gryffindor.    Hah I think you're overreacting homie, they look totally fine.  In terms of colors to go with it you can never go wrong with the "safe" picks like grey, navy, burgundy (which you are wearing well in your pic), olive, etc.    You can also check out this [color scheme designer]([URL] and mix and match colors. ||||| Yeah that's a pretty saturated color for pants. They're usable but not how you're wearing them here. There's too many colors going on with them - maroon, gray, black, ochre. The colors are mot meshing well. With the pants being what they are I'd stick to simple basic colors. White or light blue shirts, navy sweaters, brown shoes. Those are just starting points to give you an idea.

If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**  No  I currently have a 2 and a half year old Lenovo Laptop but it gets pretty hot pretty quick so I can't really game for more then 4 hours or my FPS drops dramatically. I currently reach 60 FPS on LoL with lowest settings possible, but I would like to at least max out LoL which probably isn't too hard. ||||| Since you're doing some coding as well as streaming, but you didn't want to overclock, I chose the Xeon. As well, pairing a 970 with a 144Hz is a good band for you buck performance wise. Finally, both the mouse and keyboard have very good reviews.

8390	1,3,2,3	10	[deleted] ||||| For your first attempt I'd say this is pretty spectacular, it doesn't fall into the trap of using a generic square shape or putting too many broken things at once.  Points on your map:  * The middle feels too clunky and cramped to ave those four islands there, I' recommend reducing the size or number of islands  * The button to get that gate by the bomb is too out of the way, you'd have someone way out of position to defend the endzone  * I'm not sure how well those super boosts would work in a map this small, it either sends you backwards, or hitting those spikes  * The bomb cannon also feels way to strong, plus is inhibited by those islands at center  It's pretty good aside from those points.  I made a remix of it too: [URL] ||||| Any inspiration from this? [URL] Which I myself ripped off of someone. ||||| I'm liking the updates. Been on my phone all day so I can't test em yet.
2500	1,3,3	3	Over the last few months my 15" rMBP had developed an unsightly ['stain']([URL] in the middle of the screen, and recently appeared around the bezel, which turned out to be the anti-reflective coating wearing away. Some quick searching on [this sub]([URL] and online, showed it to be an [issue affecting many rMBPs]([URL] of the same model.  In the forums and threads i read it didn't seem that Apple was replacing the displays under warranty, as it fell under ‘cosmetic damage’; as /u/RoboWarriorSr pointed out, the degradation is potentially caused by unapproved glass cleaners, but i genuinely can’t remember ever using any. I also read somewhere that it may be caused by oils and acids from your fingers transferring to the keyboard and then the screen when it’s closed.  I was really disappointed in, what i considered, a defective product, so I thought i’d hedge my bets and take it to an Apple Store, as i have the extended warranty and i was eager to fight my corner.  I didn’t have to. I spoke to the technician for a little while and he mentioned that Apple are aware of the issue and are looking into it - but at the moment they’re doing it on a case by case basis. He *did* ask me if i used any glass cleaner (which i outright denied) and he also said they think it might be the ridges on the F and J keys etching onto the screen when the lid is closed. He popped into the back to speak to a colleague and returned to say they would honour the warranty and replace the display! £466 for free. They didn’t have the part in stock, so i left my laptop with them having been told it could take a week to complete the job. The next day i had a call saying my laptop was ready for collection!  Oh, the Genius even replaced my power adapter because it was fraying around the MagSafe connecter. An all round fantastic experience.  &nbsp;  So, if anyone else is experiencing the same issue, i think these are the key points:  * Apple are aware of the issue and have instructed their retail employees to deal with it on a case-by-case basis.  * Take it to an Apple Store so you can talk to the actual technician. I honestly think chatting with the Genius Bar guy helped my argument no end. We talked about what i use my laptop for and how much i love it (i have the 2.3 GHz i7, 16GB, Iris Pro 1536MB model, which has got me though three years of uni and intensive video production work. I bloody love this machine), he even said he didn’t think i was the type of person to miss-use it or use any cleaner on the display.  * I assume having Apple Care played its part too.  * Seriously, don’t use glass cleaners/alcoholic solutions on your screen. [Follow Apple’s advice]([URL] and/or just use the microfibre cloth included with your rMBP. If you have used cleaning products, and you take it in, deny you used it.  * [Submit your details to Staingate]([URL] It can’t hurt to the pressure on Apple.  &nbsp;  Anyway, that was my experience. Is anyone else having the same issue, or has tried to get it replaced? Do you think it is cosmetic damage? Was i lucky?  tl;dr: Apple replaced my retina display for free - should've been £466 ($728) - due to the anti-reflective coating wearing away. I was under the impression they wouldn’t, as others have not been covered under warranty.  edit: a bit of formatting ||||| There basically a class action lawsuit in the works and they probably want to nip it in the bud.  ||||| I had this happen to my 2011 MBA, all the corners of most keys have etched away the coating on the screen, and where the space bar is is completely worn away. Unfortunately it's out of warranty so I just live with it.
